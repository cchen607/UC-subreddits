Not surprising. What, do people think Hamas would suddenly hang up their AK-47s and rocket launchers, restart elections, and allow equality for everyone if Israel and Jews suddenly disappeared? 

Hell no! They'll just move onto a new target. Perhaps a different country in the Middle East, or more likely, the US or another western nation. Their goal, beyond eradicating Jews and destroying Israel, is focused on tearing apart the west.

So far, Hamas is doing a fairly good job of that, sociologically-speaking. It's managed to galvanize hundreds, perhaps thousands of easily swayed (brainwashed?) America, Canadian, British, Australian, and European teenagers and 20-somethings into allying with an organization that'd restrict their rights, freedoms, and likely kill them for any perceived slight.",2,1714935331.0,t1_l2libwa

You're pulling from a fairly biased source, one that is bought and paid for by a genocidal state. They really seem to only pull articles in a way to construct a narrative that labels anti-Israel sentiment as anti-semitic.

I think there is a related institional failure at play here too though, in that UCSC doesn't directly provide a Jewish cultural space or resource center on campus.

Hillel and Koret may do plenty of other stuff too, but I do think they are explicitly Zionist:  
- ""Hillel is steadfastly committed to the support of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state"" [https://www.hillel.org/israel-guidelines/](https://www.hillel.org/israel-guidelines/)  
- ""Ensuring a bright future for Israel is one of the Koret Foundation’s original priorities."" [https://koret.org/priorities/u-s-israel-bridge-building/](https://koret.org/priorities/u-s-israel-bridge-building/)

I'm troubled by the call to cut ties with the Helen Diller Institute, which is a program founded at Berkeley Law with the ""goal of providing a rich academic forum for students and faculty to explore the breadth and complexity of Israel and contemporary Jewish issues."" Pairing a demand to cut ties to an academic institute like this with a demand to ""end academic repression"" and ""protect free speech"" feels particularly odd to me.

Students want to divest from these institutions that are Zionist not because they are Jewish. Jewish is not the same as Zionist. Zionism requires supporting Israel and the students are against Israel’s war on Palestine 

Here is why students are calling to divest from these institutions

The Hellen Diller foundation is managed by the San Francisco Jewish federation once funded Canary Mission, which is a secretive blacklist of anti-Israel students. This makes them a proIsrael organization not a proJewish organization. 

The Koret foundation Koret Project on Arab-Israel Relations “is committed to providing America's policymakers with timely analysis on issues of critical concern to Israel and its Arab neighbors”. This makes them a lobby group for Israel. 

The Israel institute is closely connected to U.S.-Israel diplomacy at the highest levels of national government that focuses on a Zionist and pro-Israel agenda. Another Israel lobby

Hillel International states that its goal is to inspire Jewish students to develop a relationship with Israel. This is encouraging Jews to support Israeli policies.

The thing about being powerless is you grasp at any power.

Do you think the Vietnamese fighters resisting America's yoke-by-proxy would have stopped at anything for freedom?
The American colonists fighting off British rule?

So what *are* Palestinians allowed to do? Petition the UN? Have fruitless ""peace talks"" wherin they can't trust a word Israel says? Simply lie back and let it happen?

Sadly the truth is there's *nothing* they can do. However they try, Palestine is powerless to resist Israeli depredation backed up by the American dollar. Cornered, desperate people fight the hardest, even if they know it's futile. 100 years from now there will *be* no Palestine.

1d0gf4k,l5o0loe,Deltadoc333,"To answer your question, despite myself being a supporter of Israel, I have never begrudged Hamas for attacking Israeli military bases or personnel. I don't like it, but I recognize it as a legitimate form of resistance. They are military targets. And I would even sadly ""understand"" if Israeli civilians were accidentally harmed in the crossfire. 

I draw the line at intentionally targeting civilians. Blowing up schools, buses, cafés, music festivals, etc. I draw the line at slaughtering women and children in their homes and burning the bodies. I draw the line at rape. That is not resistance. That is barbaric terror. 

If a Hamas rocket were to hit a Jewish daycare and kill 30 children, would that be considered a good thing? Would Hamas get on Al Jazeera and say, ""we are horrified by the loss of life. Those poor children! We meant to hit the army base."" No, Hamas would celebrate. They would consider that to be the most successful rocket fired of all time.

1d0gf4k,l5nzdq2,Persianx6,"1. 60 years? Israel has essentially ruled over what we call Palestine now since the late 1970s. Prior to that, the West Bank belonged to Jordan -- an arab country -- and Gaza belonged to Egypt -- another Arab country.
2. Palestine's current position is a result of Arafat attempting usurpation of the Jordanian crown in what we call Black September. But on the Gaza side, the result is because Islamists killed Anwar Sadat after he negotiated the Sinai peninsulas return to Egypt. One understands that the current Hamas political isolation is due to actions taken to immediate, friendly neighbors, who are now not friendly anymore. 
3. Palestine is hardly poor, but Palestinians are. Bunkers and tunnels cost millions of dollars to construct and Hamas brags, openly, about how much they've made. It comes at the expense of other infrastructure and with money raised from outside Palestine. Hamas has chosen war over and over, why do we act shocked when their choices result in retaliation and a degradation of the peace process?
4. Hamas' resistance would seem noble if Fatah hadn't already recognized Israel as an entity, thereby resulting in the birth of the PA. 
5. PA already has an observer status at the UN and would likely gain full state status, if the PA could negotiate on behalf of Gaza and the West Bank. Since 2006, Abbas has never had this power. Nor has Netanyahu decided to honor this. So in terms of international legal status, the result is a stalemate. Moreover, Abbas has never considered splitting the state into two divisions. So he simply sits and waits for power transfer or for his power to cease. 
6. Non-Hamas Palestinians would kill for peace talks. Considering that the vast majority don't support Hamas, whether living in Israel or in the West Bank, you would actually realize many more want peace -- though are wary of such -- more than historic retribution.  It should be noted that Hamas' army is 50,000 people out of a reported population of 4 million, in the territories. If you add in 2 million more Arabs in Israel, whom are counted as ""Israeli Arabs"" and whom are even more moderate and often more secular leaning than Hamas and Fatah, you begin to understand why Hamas' call for Palestinians to universally join the war, has resulted in very few doing so. Hamas is on an island unto itself. 
7. If Palestine is united under the PA rather than split between the two parties, the highest likelihood is that there would be peace talks with the framework for a state -- the 1967 borders -- as being generally agreed on.
8. Hamas' unilateral rejection of even the 1948 borders is why they keep fighting wars and dying in stupid fashion. They do not have the power to maintain their war, there is no reason for the wars besides being stubborn.",14,1716673443.0,t1_l5nutr6

And if people only want a sense of purpose then there’s nothing to argue over. Obviously neither option is happening soon.

It’s returning the land rights to the indigenous people of the Americas that were genocided during the formation of the United States (and Canada). Does not necessarily include settlers leaving, can also mean selling your land to the indigenous and paying rent/taxes to them (some folks have done this already as a personal choice, no one forced them). No one is trying to do terrorist actions against us settlers here. Like who? Where? The US is the one doing that to the indigenous peoples here. Remember Standing Rock a few years ago? The Bureau of Indian Affairs was literally formed to systemically genocide the native peoples here. 
 So yes, if you are settled in the states and are not indigenous to here, you have benefitted from the genocide of the Native Americas in the same way Israel benefits from the ongoing genocide and displacement of the Palestinian people. The United States did this to the Indigenous Americans way before Israel as a country existed. WW2- Hilter himself literally drew inspiration from Eugenics tactics the United States was using on Black and Indigenous peoples (not to name many other marginalized peoples). Like this is all stuff you can easily google.

So it doesn’t deserve the right to exist much in the same way the U.S, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, much of Latin America, etc. shouldn’t exist in their current political forms. That’s not saying the entire population that’s there will be sent back to their ancestors homeland (I.e none of these Zionists from the State of Israel are “native” to the land, their ancestry is mostly Europe and the West in general) they’d exist in a different capacity similarly to how Russians in the Soviet Union just continued living in Russia.  A lot of people are commenting about how the Hamas Charter states the extermination of all Jews, but not the context. Yes that was during its creation in 1988 and even Hamas leaders acknowledge that should’ve been specified and clarified with the times. Since then, it’s been rewritten and clarified in 2017 to specify Zionists as the primary enemy.    

The point about number 2: you try having your home, homeland and people subjugated and stolen for close to so much of your existence. Of course it’s going to state “under any means necessary”.

Palestine does mot have a military, does that mean they are not worthy of defending themselves? its just an interesting and irrelevant thing you chose to highlight. 

Israel, historically, has been consistently committing acts of violence through imperialism to Palestinians for decades. Are Palestinians supposed to allow that? They can't cry for their land, for their freedom?

Usage of this phrase has the effect of making members of the Jewish and pro-Israel community feel unsafe and ostracized.

1cfk82i,l1t4gdr,willardTheMighty,"At the same time, colleges are stewards of public funds and if they can make stickers/posters without paying artists then it’s a responsible decision in that sense. 

It makes me think of the example from the first chapter of Karl Marx’s *Capital*. A sweater may cost £10.00 because a worker could make one in a day and they need to charge that much in order to survive; you’re paying for the labor. But upon the invention of the garment factory, where a worker could make 10 sweaters per day, the cost of a sweater dropped to £1.00! The seamstress making the sweater by hand might still need to charge £10.00 in order to survive, but the *market value of her labor* has decreased because machines can do it much faster and at lower cost. Similarly, the market value of an artist’s labor in making a sticker or poster has decreased since the emergence of AI art. It’s not fair to insist that we only buy sweaters from the seamstress and not the factory; to insist that we pay more when we can get the same product at 1/10th the price. And it’s not fair to insist that we go to a human artist for every single sticker or poster.",4,1714408975.0,t1_l1pww0z

It’s privileged to take the honor or excitement out of an achievement that a ton of people would kill for.

I’m grateful to be in this position but would never dream of trying to tell someone else to care less about something they’re proud of. It’s privileged to assume higher education is easily and readily available to the whole world. It isn’t. It should be but it’s not, so I’ll always advocate for us more privileged humans to respect that people are working their ass off to get here and maybe use it as inspiration to remind us that we are allowed to be excited about our achievements even if some jaded mfs are telling us it’s lame or wrong to be happy",11,1716071195.0,t1_l4k5bo2

also many gazans don’t have internet access, so it’s hard to reach them. if you’d like to help and hopefully get more palestinians aware of the protests in the US, you can buy and email an esim to a palestinian family so they can make contact. that would be greatly appreciated if you have the capacity and funds :)

We camped out, we took over buildings, we generally made life on campus difficult.  The resultant effect was a complete divestiture by the UC system.  This was followed by divestitures by schools across the United States and eventually the fall of the apartheid system in South Africa.  Direct action gets the goods.  It is many times uncomfortable.  
“In July 1986, the UC Regents voted to divest $3.1 billion from companies doing business with South Africa's apartheid government, which was the largest university divestment in the country at the time.

Looked like a deer, might have been a cow.** There was also the night when we went out during a storm, and as we wandered out during a dry moment into the meadow above Elfland, the full moon came out and I saw a night rainbow. Muted colors curving across a brilliant moonlit sky. I did not seek out the pot of gold however.""

By playing the role of the world police, the US has an immense influence on… well everything. Simply put, the US has a seat at every important table. The US has a say in every major world event. This means the US gets the better end of a foreign trade deal most of the time. Why do you think the US dollar is THE universal currency? By maintaining a powerful influence world wide, the US dollar becomes a very strong currency. A strong dollar means imported goods from outside the US (basically anything that says “Made in not-USA”) would be cheaper for YOU, the consumer, while US exported goods would be worth more. 

Generally speaking, capitalism works best in stable, democracy-led countries, which means by playing the world police, the US can shape the world to its desired state to do business with. That kind of impact on a global scale is invaluable. 

TLDR: The money the US uses to buy influence and allies around the world pays off, by a lot. “Money buys friends” they say, and having friends all over the world makes for a good economy.",3,1716277450.0,t1_l4z5ugr

Well you’re still proving my point correct. Good for you for helping high school or younger students. Jobs don’t care about your tutors/mentors from before university. College internships are important for getting a job, and that’s what these defense companies provide. 

&gt; it’s interesting to see how many people comment in bad faith like they think I’m trying to start an argument

It’s no so much people think you’re starting an argument but they are countering your statement. It’s one thing that there’s a military industrial complex it’s another to make up a term like “military industrial academic complex” just bc the university helps student connect to internships by companies in that sector or pursue joint research endeavors. Schools also connect students with internships and do partnership projects in a variety of sectors, such as tech, medicine, teaching, and government. Do private schools like Stanford cease to be private universities bc they collaborate with the government in research and job opportunities? No, and no one makes up a bogus phrase for it like private-government complex schools. Universities just try to provide their students with career experiences and grow their research output, and that will include military weapons companies bc there’s plenty of people that get degrees in physics, engineering, etc. and it would be incredibly pathetic to not support those students or industries bc some other people are upset military weapons get used in wars they disagree with it.

I know reporting about fentanyl is pretty common now, but I think of new students who throughout high school and living at home were never going to “do drugs” and don’t see themselves as that kind of person.

He was busy, and in addition to the regular academic work, he asked a TA for one of his classes to do some extra work for him.  The understanding was that Ben was going to be moving and did want to take his older car with him when he left.  He was going to give the car to the TA when he moved in exchange for the work.  When the time came for him to move he decided that he didn’t want to give the car to the TA and also didn’t compensate the TA for the additional work for him.

This meant you could get up to the treehouse from a 5-6 foot ladder, and on the other side of the circle it would be about a 40-50ft drop off (anyone please feel free to check my estimations). In the middle of the circle on the ground there was a small area cleared of brush that would be used as the arena.

MLK jr never marched without a suit, and was never seen more than twenty feet from a US flag. He appealed to the constitutional principles and democratic Republican values of the citizens he sought to persuade. He wrote an explicit justification for the laws he broke, breaking only those laws he saw as unjust. People talk about the letter from a Birmingham jail, but they seem to pretend the sophisticated basis of civil disobedience through natural right and democratic process aren’t there. They miss the parts where he says “it is understandable to be concerned about our willingness to break the law,” and “it is reasonable to require a permit for demonstration”

One source of internal conflict for me has been the awareness that similar atrocities (and worse) are occurring every few years all over the world, yet we take almost no notice of them: South Sudan, Darfur, the Tamils in Sri Lanka, it goes on and on. The more educated I get, the more I feel I should be doing, and yet the more powerless I feel. What I have landed on is that we, as Americans, bear more responsibility for Palestine because our government is funding it and supplying a lot of the weapons. But even with Palestine, the amount we can directly affect is so limited. Even if we can pressure the UC Regents to sell off all their S&amp;P 500 index funds and their T-bills, I don't see any path by which that affects Israeli military policy even slightly.

1d5r4c9,l6nt477,OhNothing13,"Yeah that's one point the pro-Israel crowd does correctly make: what's happening in Gaza is happening all around the world on a fairly frequent basis. Maybe not with the number of bombs or the level of military tech Israel has access to, but there are ethnic massacres happening all the time that major news networks completely ignore. That's one thing I've found Al Jazeera to be good for, they tend to mention conflicts and violence that CNN and FOX would never cover. 

In addition, the US also funds other countries (like Saudi Arabia in Yemen) that are committing war crimes very similar to Israel's, but Israel consistently gets more attention. Personally, I think that's more a function of how loudly invested many Jewish Americans are in Israel vs. how Yemeni Americans don't have that kind of voice, but antisemitism probably also plays a part in it. 

The whole divestment thing though...I just don't get it. Asking for that really IS like asking the universities to reject capitalism and the United States military. Israel is so intertwined with the military industrial complex at this point, and the military industrial complex is so baked into our economic system that meeting SJP's demands is never gonna happen. I think what you suggested, reaching out to representatives to influence US foreign policy, is much more effective. The protestors could also probably make a much bigger impact by protesting the FEDERAL government and demanding the executive branch push Israel to genuinely pursue a two state solution.

Correct that this matter has more attention due to US' $ involvement and some taxpayer &amp; tuition payers want divestment. Countries where the US has much lower presence, the outrage is far, far less.

We elected GW Bush, who bombed and invaded Iraq on a lie...so, when do the Iraqi's get to bomb all of our major cities, hm? But to your absurd comparison:

Apple: Gaza (not a nation-state) has been a concentration camp with a medieval style blockade under Israel's Apartheid System, for 17yrs.  They finally had enough on 10/7.  No more invasions from Hamas were involved since.

Orange: Putin invaded Ukraine, a nation-state completely separate from Russia.

Glad to clear that up.

&gt;You are cheering on Hamas just because they are losing.

Oh, pal...a coupla things:

1. I am not ""cheering on"" Hamas, but I can understand how the zionist tunnel blindness might make you think that way.
2. By every single metric, Israel is losing. Let's do the numbers:

* Is Hamas destroyed? In October BB stated it would take ""6 or 7 months.""  How's that working out? Fun fact: Hamas membership is BOOMING.  Apparently they have more applicants than arms.  Gosh, who coulda guessed that if you wipe out a whole family, the survivors might turn to ever more violent responses in increasing numbers?
* Have the hostages been returned?  Hamas tried to offer a deal WAY back in October 9th.  But isn't it great how Israel's invasion is proceeding...aCcOrDiNg To \*(cough) PlAn?
* How's Israel's rep as a fierce sabra in the desert, doing?  Oh wait, that's right.  IRAN attacked, and Israel responded...by hitting a radar installation.  LMAO!
* How about Israel's international rep?  How's that...heh...hahah...ahahaha! Sorry, I just can't finish the sentence.  Pretty obv how they're doing on the world stage.
* And Israel's economy...it must be BOOMING. I mean, war generally stimulates economies.  Right?  Nnnope.
* And how about Israel's core purpose--to provide a safe space for Jews?  Well gosh: I think about 100,000 Israelis' having to evacuate the North b/c of Hezbollah, might have something to say about that (to say nothing of the rise of antisemitism, overall)...

&gt;It is a very terrible thing they started a war, but it is a very good thing they are losing.

You remind me so much of Saddam Hussein's Chief of Staff on the day the US invaded...offering assurances to the reporters that everything's ""under control:"" even as the US bombs are rattling the State buildings in Baghdad with ""Shock and Awe.""

Like when the Nazis would burn down a whole village because there were partisans in the area. Their genocide is to send a message. They’ve been quite open about that.

Of course it didn’t work for the Nazis so not sure why these guys think following their example is such a good idea.

They seem to have the idea that had they just been allowed to do a genocide they wouldn't have lost a specific war. A number of Israelis also don't seem to get they can't exterminate their way to safety and that nothing legitimizes their crimes against humanity.

1d5r4c9,l6poihk,Beardmanta,"And it makes sense. 

There's a narrative that Palestines in Israeli prisons are unjust

The Gilad Shalit afair tells a very different story. The 1,027 Palestine prisoners released for him included Sinwar who orchestrated the October 7th attack. Dozens of other prisoners released that day have engaged in other terrorist attacks killing 6 Israeli civilians in July of 2015 for example, multiple have participated in the development and firing of unguided rockets into Israeli cities. It also led to a $1m bounty funded by various Arab states for the live capture of Israeli soldiers. All for the release of 1 man.

You do NOT give the tantruming child the candy unless you want more tantrums. (Replace tantrums with brutal murder, kidnapping, and rape, if the analogy isn't obvious enough.) Negotiating with terrorists just encourages more terrorism.

If I was the family or the hostages I'd want them back at any cost, but it's the duty of the government to think of the lives of the country as a whole. Massive prisoner exchanges (especially when Hamas insists on insane ratios like 1,000 Palestinians to 1 Israeli) should be rejected. It will just lead to hundreds of not thousands of more deaths/kidnappings. 

Hamas needs to be removed before any peace can be achieved. If the hostages can be freed along the way that's ideal, but there's no version of a peaceful Middle East that can exist with radical jihadist in control of Gaza.",1,1717294862.0,t1_l6pajkh

I'm sure it was much worse for the students/staff who live off-campus and anyone who relies on the bus, but for most of the non-affiliated community, a protest at the base of campus is almost business as usual, even when it blocks traffic.  The neighborhood reaction to most of these is indifference or a general sense of supporting anything union-led.

There is far less neighborhood support this time around, but I think the big difference is that SJP's positions as stated are pretty hard to support, even if you don't agree with what Israel is doing in Gaza.

When I was a student there were plenty of people who resented the student protestors but didn't say anything in person because they're either too busy to deal with it, or didn't have the bandwidth to deal with a mob of angry protestors. 

Regardless of what the cause you're protesting for, there are some people who have to be on campus. Their schedule can not change regardless of how they feel about a protested issue. Maybe they can't afford another quarter and are stressed about going into financial debt. Maybe they work in a bio lab and have animals that constantly depend on them to be properly housed and fed. Or maybe they just have jobs on campus and aren't eligible for union membership and are therefore unprotected.

If you mean directly, like Israel having a right to exist as it (mostly) is currently, makes someone conservative, well, for myself anyway, I am a HUGE believer and supporter of LGBTQ+ rights.  And I also know that the only Middle Eastern country LGBTQ+ are safe in is Israel - the ONLY country in the Middle East that has legal protections for that community, and the only country in the Middle East where they have legal and safe Pride parades.

I don’t consider myself conservative at all - if anything, I’m middle of the road on a lot of issues, but with strong support for LGBTQ+ rights, and equal rights for women, as well.  And again, Israel is really the only place in the Middle East for that sort of thing.  So, I do support Israel - because I KNOW how this area of the world is currently run, AND because I know history.

That said, I’m not ok with slaughtering Palestinian civilians, but I DO think Hamas has a huge amount of blame at their feet for it.

So, I don’t know - maybe you still think I’m conservative for supporting Israel, but I’m not (and for the record, I think Trump is a wacko orange guy who I’d NEVER want in office again!).

I do know history, though, and I definitely do NOT support Hamas, and the rest of their terrorist friends…

If on the other hand, you mean with people taking offense to the protests, well they do block off parts of the campus for everyone else, disrupting people just trying to get their degrees or to work, etc.

Previously, hundreds of thousands of Jews were living relatively peacefully among other residents of the area. Jewish Zionists either destroyed or stole the homes of their neighbors, and literally renamed their cities to Hebrew names.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba

&gt;The Nakba (Arabic: النَّكْبَة an-Nakba, lit. 'the catastrophe') was the ethnic cleansing[1] of Palestinians in Mandatory Palestine during the 1948 Palestine war through their violent displacement and dispossession of land, property, and belongings, along with the destruction of their society, and the suppression of their culture, identity, political rights, and national aspirations.[2] The term is also used to describe the ongoing persecution and displacement of Palestinians by Israel.[3] As a whole, it covers the fracturing of Palestinian society and the long-running rejection of the right of return for Palestinian refugees and their descendants.[4][5]

&gt;During the Nakba in 1948, approximately half of Palestine's predominantly Arab population, or around 750,000 people,[6] were expelled from their homes or made to flee, at first by Zionist paramilitaries through various violent means, and after the establishment of the State of Israel, by the Israel Defense Forces. This occurred in the wake of dozens of massacres targeting Palestinian Arabs and the depopulation of 500 Arab-majority towns and villages,[7] with many of these being either completely destroyed or repopulated by Jews and given new Hebrew names. By the end of the war, 78% of the total land area of the former Mandatory Palestine was controlled by Israel and at least 15,000 Palestinian Arabs had been killed.",0,1717342439.0,t1_l6qjjmk

Nobody is disputing that 700,000 Palestinians were displaced in the decade following WW2. But it was from a combination of voluntary relocation, encouragement from Arab leaders, and (yes) persecution by Jews in what is now Israel.

As to whether it will be engaging at UCSC, that's a different matter - bachelor's degree in math can be achieved just about anywhere and UCs tend to cater math programs more toward post graduate research. 

If you wanna go into private equity, a bachelor's in math is a less likely path to get you there. Private equity jobs look for business or analysis skills and math might help in an indirect way, but getting a job in private equity depends more on your connections than the undergraduate degree you earn. Undergrad is minimum just to get your foot in the door for tech and especially private equity (tech jobs prefer candidates have a bachelor's, but don't necessarily require it whereas the vast majority of private equity jobs will require an undergrad degree if not 99% of the time)",1,1717490787.0,t1_l719hop

Intifada: shake down/uprising literal translation. Use in Palestine/israel: references a multiple of violent terrorist attacks against Jews over the span of decades. People in your school community literally have family members killed during these intifadas.

Intifada revolution / globalize the intifada: do the above everywhere!!!  Now couple this with all of the white supremacists who hate Jews manipulating well intended college kids into furthering their cause and literally creating violence and disorder for college students across the country.

There is only one solution: blatant reference to Hitler “The Final Solution”
If it wasn’t, then why on earth was this the choice of words? Why is this even a sentiment? Some people I have talked to (and know in person) who are super pro Palestine have told me (a Jewish person) that their cause does not go against a two state solution. A Palestinian acquaintance of mine from school actually specifically told me this. 
 
So logically, why is this anti-Israel activism the only solution? The only solution to what? A free Palestine? Free how? Who is leading each? Who allowed to live where? 

Does anyone in Palestine/israel agree to a 1 state solution at this time? Does either group feel they’d be safe in a country that consisted of full integration of both groups??? Obviously there has *not* been one solution figured out or it would have already been enacted. 

So what exactly does this phrase mean??? To me it sounds like it is very specifically designed to be intimidating and reference hitlers slaughter of Jews. For me personally who also has a disability, I’m double triggered by this since Hitler also killed, experimented on, and effectively tortured all kinds of disabled people and allegedly it’s a progressive cause to encourage lawful eugenics (facilitating ‘legal suicide’ for treatable disabilities)

Just the other week I read an article written by a person with the same mental illness as me published in a reputable source saying her life was so miserable she should be allowed to die because treatment doesn’t help her. Was this my one solution to my medication resistant bipolar depression? It’s not. I fought for 3 years to try a seizure medication I read about that’s explicitly approved to treat bipolar depression which 3 prior incompetent doctors either refused to consider or prescribe for reasons that equated to nothing more than they were uneducated about this option for me. It isn’t a new drug. It isn’t newly approved for this problem either. And Guess what? It works amazing  for me and now I have felt fine for 2 years after not feeling normal since I was 12. 

The answer to all of this horrible rhetoric and ideology is more compassion, more understanding, and more respect for people who have problems you don’t understand. For example disabled people. 

For a more relevant overall example, many of your Zionist Jewish student peers who are offended, intimidated, and scared, to whom being a Zionist means absolutely nothing beyond believing in the existence of a state entitled to Jewish self determination.

No, not really. I’m not sure why us going to Israel for a week is such a big deal. It’s the only place in the world we aren’t a religious minority. It’s the only place in the world we aren’t an ethnic minority.

Actually my takeaway, and same with my brother when he went, was that damn it sucks here thank god I was born in America. Too much racism and too many bombs flying from both groups. If Jewish kids are raised that Israel is important to Jews (it is) then there’s nothing wrong with them learning about Israel. I strongly feel that they all should, so that they can be informed and make their opinions based on experience instead of religious regurgitation.

Some of us actually have analyzed everything about the situation and yet your comment indicates and insinuates that only you have analyzed the situation and that anyone who holds a different analysis than you is in the wrong. If you hold the belief that students marching and occupying buildings on campus is wrong, power to you. IDF agrees with you and even bombed universities in Gaza (in addition to many buildings apart from universities) to prove it.

There's a high sense of irony I sense in the retort that ""y'all (aren't analyzing anything and are) doing this (futile activity)"". I don't disagree that some tactics and actions could be better executed; but the premise of this specific thread of comments insinuates that any action on campus which disrupts regularly scheduled activities is bad simply because one student posted that it makes them feel anxious. Inducing anxiety upon those who will be affected by actions is absolutely a point of consideration that organizers and ""activists"" should always consider. Ultimately, the call to still make and take action in spite of a few anxieties of a few people is one that organizers and activists should take responsibility for. But the voices that should be centered in any actions should be the voices and experiences of the most marginalized. In this case, the most marginalized voices are those of Palestinian people who are being targeted and murdered by the IDF (which is brazenly giving the middle finger to the entire world with regard to human rights and international laws). If students and faculty don't agree with the idea of respect for basic human rights and laws, then maybe they shouldn't be learning or teaching at a public institution which holds such values.",-1,1716326408.0,t1_l52qo9d

&gt; Born a Crime is an autobiography and details Trevor Noah's personal struggle with apartheid. Not sure what it has to do with student protestors in America.

His memoir is about more than just that. He was born and lived through the fall of apartheid. It wasn't divestment that took it down. It was the people that stayed at the table. College students protesters did nothing but write glowing articles about themselves and then moved on to their next cause de jour.  Meanwhile, native Africans ended up starving and fighting each other in the streets over limited resources, which prolonged Apartheid. 

Read *Sanctions on South Africa: What Did They Do?* by Philip Levy. He was working at the Economic Research and Analysis Unit in Geneva at that time. The divestment erased decades of work done by the people in South Africa to take down Apartheid. It was already coming apart when the student protests began.

The issue is they have no incentive to do this because for every UCSC student that gets on they bill the school, regardless of where they get on or off.

Individual students similarly have no incentive to self regulate because it doesn't cost them anything directly to ride a METRO bus between two campus stops. They're already paying for unlimited rides through fees.

1cnehq4,l39bxnq,bransanon,"I get why you're frustrated. Thing is, the University actually runs a more limited loop bus schedule specifically because it's understood that the Metro buses should also be used for the same purpose. If people stopped using the Metro's as loops, the loops would be overflowing at peak times.

Also, the cost of the Metro buses is baked into student fees. With very few students actually using them to regularly go on and off campus, this is those students literally just using the bare minimum of a service they've paid for.

Before someone chimes in and says they should just add more loops, that isn't exactly a good solution either. That would just mean an excessive number of buses on campus, more environmental/traffic impact, increased student fees, and money being wasted on the UC's massive contract with Metro (which basically subsidizes the entire Metro operation BTW, it would be insolvent if it weren't for the UC contract).

All that said, I always tried to be cognizant if a bus was full and people looked like they were trying to head off campus. That is a courtesy message worth spreading IMO.

1cxipqs,l53se1n,Ok_Patience_167,"Well i agree with this sentiment to an extent. However we are  a democracy and the leader of the free world and that does come with some responsibility and strategic incentive to support our democratic allies globally. I don’t claim to know exactly what form and amount that aid should take and exactly to which allies.  I don’t think anyone can answer that question perfectly and it’s a dynamic situation.  

There is an extreme divide on the issue of aid to Israel and divestment right now although I am not sure if we really know how many Americans feel one way or the other.  It is likely that many fall somewhere in the middle but like so much of US politics right now we have been a fractured country with extreme positions taking a lot of the limelight.  

On the one side you have those who would immediately stop every penny of aid to Israel immediately and divest every dime.  This is based on the current situation on the ground in Palestine with the immediate state of conflict, injuries, casualties, malnutrition, need for medical supplies etc that the Palestinians are suffering.  
No one I think is in any dispute of the current situation and how horrible it is.  There have been some serious questions raised as to exact numbers and it seems as if the UN had been able to verify half the amount of deaths at this point that were reported by the authorities in Gaza.  

A big difference is whether it is phrased as a resistance to genocide or another stage of war in a long long war.  
In the other end of the spectrum is Israelis stance in how it claims it needs to defend itself at the moment and to be proactive in rioting at Hamas which is in control in Palestine and literally hurried underground in tunnels, shelled to a large extent by design behind schools and hospitals which makes the avoidance of innocent bloodshed nearly impossible in Israel’s attempt to eradicate Hamas.  For a long.time the mainstream consensus was that Hamas were clearly bad actors and basically evil terrorists that would stop at anything.  However now I would say that there is some softening of that position at least by certain extreme Pro Palestinian tropa like the SJP who has been leading this protest.  Or in any event they do not care to focus on that so much as they wish to focus on the fact that the atrocities and state of “genocide” of Palestinian lives is to a point where Hamas is somehow besides the point.  

Which brings me to the final divide between the two factions : the very right of Israel to exist .  As mentioned SJP sees this as a rightful resistance answer some characterize it as an apartheid (which brings up other pints of debate).  Israel does not basically see this conflict as a “genocide” but rather as a war and the very fight for the existence of Israel.  SJP has in its central mission that Israel is a colonial white supremacist state that should never have been created and should cease to exist.  They call Zionism, the support for a Jewish homeland nation,  evil and wrong. They have not stated where exactly they think that Israelis should relocate which many find puzzling.  However the Jewish have been there historically in this region thousands of years ago before exiled various times and persecuted across the globe etc.  After WWII there were negotiations between Egypt and Britain to enable Jews to return to this region, to buy land and repopulate it.  This repopulation began to a large extent in late 1800s and early 1900s as well with so much persecution of Jews in Europe.  Well long story short for the past 70’years they never really did get the kinks out in terms of who has the exact right to what region.  It was always supposed to be a two state solution and in an ideal world it would have functioned much better than it has with Palestinians having autonomy and the ability to thrive as a people in their own land.

However there is also a real question over whether the Muslim world or at least extreme factions of the Muslim Arab world ever really wanted or would ever agree to allow this to happen.   Hence the failure of something like 5 attempts at two state solutions to enable peace over the past 70 years.  Botched attempts of diplomacy with extremism on both sides, attacks, bombings.  It appears that SJP feels that a two state solution is just impossible and therefore Israel needs to go.  On the other hand there are extremists in Israel who feel the same about Palestine .  There are however many Zionists like myself who want to see all hostages returned and ton alleviate the suffering of innocents on both sides and who want nothing more than a two state solution, for these two nations to somehow miraculously do-exist.  Both extreme sides would likely call me a dreamer .   I know have left out a lot of the exact detail of the exact force used at different times and how one side would call it defensive and the other oppressive etc  also there is a broader context of countries and players that surround and complicate this conflict .  but I do hope that anyone could read this and see that I did try to be objective in my overall characterization of this whole still communicating my individual opinion..",16,1716339751.0,t1_l5387jg

1cxipqs,l53g83y,BananaSloots,"Thanks for your genuine question, and I'm glad to see at least a few helpful responses. I try not to waste my time responding here because this Reddit leans towards folks who complain or argue in bad faith. To the people reducing the protests to ""virtue signaling"", I'd point out that many, many folks said that about BLM protests in 2020, yet that did result in changes across many cities and police departments (though not nearly enough) across the country and sparked important conversations that continue to today. Anyway, I've hyperlinked a bunch of things I mention here to sources, some of which are behind paywalls, which you can find your way around using [https://12ft.io/](https://12ft.io/), and many sources vary from the Times of Israel to Al Jazeera.

To your question, [the protest is due to the involvement and investment of several American universities](https://www.timesofisrael.com/at-heart-of-protests-sweeping-us-universities-is-demand-they-divest-from-israel/), including the UC, [in American and Israeli companies and organizations that are supporting the current Israeli military campaign (now recognized as a genocide) in Gaza](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/13/usuniversity-ties-to-weapons-contractors-under-scrutiny-amid-war-in-gaza). As some have pointed out the UC invests money directly (only about $54 million) and indirectly (billions) into these companies. [One point of the protests is to divest this spending, and instead work with the fund managers to set up socially responsible funds.](https://apnews.com/article/california-regents-university-divestment-israel-a10e121cfa68badab77efc65d8ea1925) At the very least, many UCSC protestors are asking for **funding transparency at the very least** (as was done in UC Berkeley) and **various levels of divestment and re-investment** as options for moving forward.

The bombs killing women and children are sold by the US and despite calls to not supply the genocide, the [US still sells weapons and technologies to the IDF](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/06/us-weapons-israel-gaza/) though most recently, there's been a [pause](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/which-bombs-has-the-united-states-stopped-shipping-to-israel), but not cessation. [The algorithms and tech of these weapons, military technologies, surveillance technologies, and other offensive tools were developed by American universities and partnerships.](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/bird-hls) On our campus alone, many of our departments' research is funded through DARPA (the military) and [the advancements made in that research can be used in the military for their own purposes, including trading or giving that knowledge to other militaries in deals.](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/expanded-agenda-us-israel-partnership-new-technologies-new-opportunities) At the moment, none of this is transparent to the researchers and graduate students working on our research.

Will this protest be effective? I don't know. Is it useless? I don't think so. UC Divest has been trying to call attention to this issue for literal decades, through discussion and arbitration and yes some protesting, and it's resulted in some change but not enough. Are the protests anti-Semitic? With many Jewish supporters for the protest (including many of the organizers in the undergrad and grad movements), it's hard to make that claim, but that'll be up to each member of the Jewish community. Hope this helps!",29,1716334591.0,t3_1cxipqs
1cxipqs,l572i3v,commissionersgordons,"A few fact checks:

Israel's actions have not been [legally found to meet the threshold of the legal term ""genocide.""](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g9g63jl17o) This is why journalists and other objective observers continue to avoid the term (despite all of the criticism of media bias, you cannot simply parrot powerful accusations like this without factual basis). Israel has committed war crimes, as has Hamas. Hence, the International Criminal Court's [issuance of arrest warrants for top Israeli and Hamas leaders](https://apnews.com/article/icc-khan-netanyahu-070941d21ccd1f2b9611032b88527575). Obviously, scale is important to consider when judging the depths of the atrocities, and the tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians who are now dead because of Israel's bombardment of Gaza is enormous in comparison to the 1,200 dead after the Hamas attack. Neither are excusable, but scale does matter when it comes to human life.

The [BIRD program](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/bird-hls) you linked to is hardly a reflection of overarching complicity by American universities in war. The program issues $2.5 million a year in research grants. That is quite small.

That's not to say there isn't federal funding linked to DoD in American universities. But, for instance, the Army Corps of Engineers is part of DoD, so a project related to infrastructure might be receiving DoD money — there isn't a direct line between DoD funding and pro-war complicity.

The other part of all this that is conflated, as pointed out elsewhere in this thread, is endowments and investment portfolios, which is distinct from research funding, or food/housing costs. Does the National Science Foundation, one of the largest government funders of research (including climate change, conservation, medical, public health, and all that good stuff) also have an investment portfolio that includes weapons and military? [Yes](https://new.nsf.gov/news/8-ways-national-science-foundation-supports-our). Does your retirement fund? Yes. Do most of the companies whom we purchase from? Yes.

The fundamental issue here — and the reason [why divestment often isn't effective](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248088063/divest-divestment-university-college-protesters-campus-israel-gaza-invasion) — is that the global economy is incredibly complex, and is reflective of all the good and bad human behaviors that exist.

I know there’s a lot for OP to take in and process, but I’ll try to cover a few view points, but these are just my opinions and I can’t speak for others.

UC school system has investments and research intertwined with Israel.

Israel is not a real democracy because it displaced and killed those that opposed it along the way while importing like minded thinkers till it had the votes to call itself a democracy. Gerrymandering on the most extreme side.

Apartheid. It’s no secret if we talk about the double standards. One should acknowledge the standards of living of Israeli Jews to Israeli Arabs. There are laws in the books favoring Jews in Israel. Then there is the Palestinian Arabs standard of living. They can’t even collect rain water because it’s considered property of Israel.

What does it have to do with the US and us?
There are laws in the US that support Israeli interests which is weird to support a foreign government.

I believe the creation of Israel was a mistake that needs correcting. A 2 state solution is not a good one in my opinion. I recommend the Millet system under one Palestinian state while returning the land stolen during the creation of Israel.

How the house of Representatives voted.

Endowments are not meant to be spent. If your endowment shrinks, you did a bad job managing your endowment. Endowments are invested and managed and the interest they generate contributes to the school’s operating budget.   

 What the protests are asking the university to do is reinvest the money in the endowment from investments that are the most profitable to investments that are less profitable, which means that those investments would generate less spendable money each year.

1cxipqs,l54r2ed,Accomplished-Card239,"Your statement reflects two fundamental misconceptions. The first is that it asks what the Palestinians want, as if those in a position to negotiate peace represent the will of the Palestinian public. The Palestinians have never had a true representative democracy. The average Palestinian deals primarily with his or her own day to day existence. They accept without question or dissent the rhetoric and propaganda fed to them by their leaders whose agenda was fixed, in the case of the Palestine Liberation Organization, by the Arab League, which founded the organization in 1964, three years before the Six Day War left Israel in control of the Jordanian occupied “West Bank”, led by the Egyptian born Yasser Arafat, and in the case of Hamas, by their parent organization, the Moslem Brotherhood, also based in Egypt.
The second misconception relates to the term Peace. It is a word with a wide variety of subjective meanings. Peace to some is simply the absence of war. To some it is a state of mind. Israelis see peace as what will exist once the conflict has been resolved and put behind us. For Palestinians that is not possible because Israel's very existence is an affront to them. No one wants to be subjected to the horrors of warfare, but no one wants peace at the price of unconditional surrender, either. Their claim to Palestine can never be resolved as long as Israel exists. At best they can be mollified and set aside their aspirations of restoring what was.
The Palestinian public and the international community have been bombarded by decades of propaganda of Israeli atrocities and repression, which has been used to justify Palestinian violence from suicide bombings through rocket barrages on Israeli cities and neighborhoods. While these are not acts of people who desire Peace, the support by the Palestinian public of these acts reflects a sincere belief on their part that they are legitimate reprisals for what they have been brainwashed to believe Israel has done to them.
So to argue that Palestinian violence against Israelis prove they do not want peace is not necessarily accurate. It could simply mean that Palestinians want peace but only a peace that in their view addresses their perceived grievances.
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes Palestinian are at peace as long as they want to be. They are nearly all governed by a Palestinian government, hardly different in practice from what would exist had they achieved independence. Conditions are not significantly worse than in other Arab countries, and for some they are better. When they initiate hostilities against Israelis that peace is shattered, but it is by their own choice, and ultimately peaceful conditions are restored whenever they decide to end their hostilities, because for Israelis there is nothing to be gained by prolonging the state of conflict.

Those of you who accept at face value allegations against Israel by sources with an interest in the vilification of Israel, those who don't question the veracity of the claims used to incite violence and prevent reconcilliation, are allowing themselves to be manipulated to prevent the Palestinians from achieving peace.

1cxipqs,l54rmmm,Accomplished-Card239,"I am sorry for such a long answer. But I truly believe that if one wants to learn they will be able to locate truthful sources. I will try to explain this situation to my best abilities and hopefully at least some of us can read it to the very end:
Our (American people) vision reflects two fundamental misconceptions. The first is that it asks what the Palestinians want, as if those in a position to negotiate peace represent the will of the Palestinian public. The Palestinians have never had a true representative democracy. The average Palestinian deals primarily with his or her own day to day existence. They accept without question or dissent the rhetoric and propaganda fed to them by their leaders whose agenda was fixed, in the case of the Palestine Liberation Organization, by the Arab League, which founded the organization in 1964, three years before the Six Day War left Israel in control of the Jordanian occupied “West Bank”, led by the Egyptian born Yasser Arafat, and in the case of Hamas, by their parent organization, the Moslem Brotherhood, also based in Egypt.
The second misconception relates to the term Peace. It is a word with a wide variety of subjective meanings. Peace to some is simply the absence of war. To some it is a state of mind. Israelis see peace as what will exist once the conflict has been resolved and put behind us. For Palestinians that is not possible because Israel's very existence is an affront to them. No one wants to be subjected to the horrors of warfare, but no one wants peace at the price of unconditional surrender, either. Their claim to Palestine can never be resolved as long as Israel exists. At best they can be mollified and set aside their aspirations of restoring what was.
The Palestinian public and the international community have been bombarded by decades of propaganda of Israeli atrocities and repression, which has been used to justify Palestinian violence from suicide bombings through rocket barrages on Israeli cities and neighborhoods. While these are not acts of people who desire Peace, the support by the Palestinian public of these acts reflects a sincere belief on their part that they are legitimate reprisals for what they have been brainwashed to believe Israel has done to them.
So to argue that Palestinian violence against Israelis prove they do not want peace is not necessarily accurate. It could simply mean that Palestinians want peace but only a peace that in their view addresses their perceived grievances.
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes Palestinian are at peace as long as they want to be. They are nearly all governed by a Palestinian government, hardly different in practice from what would exist had they achieved independence. Conditions are not significantly worse than in other Arab countries, and for some they are better. When they initiate hostilities against Israelis that peace is shattered, but it is by their own choice, and ultimately peaceful conditions are restored whenever they decide to end their hostilities, because for Israelis there is nothing to be gained by prolonging the state of conflict.
So really the parties who do not want peace, those who are responsible for sustaining conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, are those involved in disseminating propaganda against Israel, in a clear effort to prevent the Palestinian public from moving forward towards a mutually beneficial negotiated solution. Those are the people who are unwilling to tolerate the existence of a non-Arab entity within what they would like to be an exclusively Arab Middle East.
Those of you who accept at face value allegations against Israel by sources with an interest in the vilification of Israel, those who don't question the veracity of the claims used to incite violence and prevent reconcilliation, are allowing themselves to be manipulated to prevent the Palestinians from achieving peace. If you support Peace don't allow yourself to be used as a tool to prevent peace. Don't parrot the lies of apartheid and genocide and the progressively more absurd claims of Israeli atrocities. Learn the objective facts. Use your intelligence. Open your eyes and see the true agenda of the people you are supporting. Do they promote cooperation, compromise, coexistence? Or do they promote hate, violence, and retribution.

1ciqilk,l2dh37h,kalimba218,"Yes, because using an inverted red triangle (explicit symbol of supporting Hamas) instead isn’t genocidal or violent at all 😐

“The symbol first appeared in propaganda videos promoted by the al-Qassam brigades, the military wing of Hamas, which showed footage of Hamas terrorists attacking Israeli military targets. In these videos, Hamas would point out the target using the inverted red triangle. Though it can be used innocuously in general pro-Palestine social media posts, the inverted red triangle is now used to represent Hamas itself and glorify its use of violence in many popular anti-Zionist memes and political cartoons. For example, individuals will place the symbol over an image of Israeli soldiers or overlaid on a Star of David as a way to call for further violent resistance.”

And just to also mention something else, it wasn't only just military targets, it was also used on surrounding villages and kibbutzim and the Nova Music Festival in footage Hamas terrorists filmed and released. 

Often you'll see on people's bios or social media the inverted red triangle to represent support for Hamas and violent resistance that targets Israeli civilians. Like let's just be real about it.
Even Al-Jazeera reports it as a symbol supporting ""resistance fighters"", aka Hamas, although Al-Jazeera does pretty openly support Hamas so it's viewed positively in their eyes.

Like African-Americans and Native-Americans, Chinese were categorized as racially inferior. Even the stereotypes describing these groups were similar. With dark skin and thick lips, Chinese men were “childlike and lustful,” with a passion for white women. Focusing on a young white girl in a Chinese-owned opi­um den, a New York Times writer reported on a conversation with the owner: “Chinaman always have something to eat, and he like young white girl.

An example of this is [the Latvian constitution](https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/57980): ""The State of Latvia... has been established by uniting historical Latvian lands and on the basis of the unwavering will of the Latvian nation to have its own State and its inalienable right of self-determination in order to guarantee the existence and development of the Latvian nation, its language and culture throughout the centuries, to ensure freedom and promote welfare of the people of Latvia and each individual."" Latvia was ruled by a series of foreign empires for hundreds of years before achieving independence after WWI. Latvia is also about 24% ethnic Russian.

Granting national self-determination to other nations within a state would mean that those nations have the right to secede and form their own states. Latvia does not grant ethnic Russians the right to secede and form Russia Jr. Similarly, Israel does not grant Israeli Arabs the right to secede and form a separate state.

France is also a representative democracy with equal rights that is 86% ethnic French and seeks to maintain a majority French population, if its immigration laws are anything to go by. Its [constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/France_2008) says ""The French people solemnly proclaim their attachment to the Rights of Man and the principles of national sovereignty,"" and ""France shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic."" It's not granting national sovereignty to the minority ethnic Italian population. 

The Nation State law literally says ""This clause does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect."" It technically removes Arabic as an official state language, but doesn't allow for any effective demotion. 

After doing some more research you might be right that the ""settlement"" term is broadly construed and often applies to the illegal settlements in the West Bank. 

I personally wouldn't have made Arabic a ""special"" language or supported settlements, and I think the Druze brought up valid complaints about wanting to be included in a national identity of Israeli, not excluded for not being Jewish. None of this makes Israel either an apartheid or an ethnostate, however, at least any more than other countries with a majority ethnic group and language.",1,1714579272.0,t1_l23l6b7
1cfhd44,l24b52k,--A3--,"""Jewish"" is a religion and an ethnicity. When Israel is founded for the purpose of being a Jewish nation, and the Nation-State bill defines national self-determination as something unique to the *Jewish people*, Israel is by definition a Jewish ethnostate.

The Latvian constitution does not say that self-determination is the unique right of ethnic Latvians. Ethnic Russians who live in Latvia are still ""The people of Latvia and each individual,"" nobody seems to be excluded.

I'm not familiar with other politics of Latvia, but I do know France has its own xenophobia problems. Anti-immigration is generally a goal of white nationalism and white ethnocentrism, and there is definitely a contingent who say ""France is for The French"" e.g. Marine Le Pen, who believes multiculturalism has failed and that France should [ban ritual slaughter](https://apnews.com/article/sports-france-europe-paris-marine-le-pen-d77606f09df17415b94c273eb71be489) and [public displays of religious clothing](https://www.jta.org/2016/10/18/global/le-pen-says-as-french-president-she-would-ban-all-religious-symbols-including-kippot), functionally banning kosher/halal diets and headscarves/kippahs.

I would say that the Israeli government is controlled by far-right nationalists who hold views similar to France's National Front party. I would also say that those views conflict with the standards we should hold ourselves to, and that they don't deserve our taxes or our investments.",1,1714583747.0,t1_l23xx80

1cfhd44,l1r5sl3,NoNewPuritanism,"Not even pro-hamas but you used the worst possible analogy for this war. The west has taken some action (sanctions) with regard to Uighurs, despite the great lack of information (and no, Adrian Zenz is not a credible source). Neither does the any western country essentially send free money to China.

On the other hand, the U.S. sends $10 Billion dollars per year to Israel. It doesn't matter if they are military credits. Why do we send that money to a first world country that can seemingly defend itself year after year? Especially now, when it would be far more help in Ukraine. If anything at all, students have the right to protest that. Israel is an increasingly unlikeable country and has been governed by the equivalent of Donald Trump for the past 2 decades. They seemingly allow actual fascists to exists in the executive branch like Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. They continue to expand illegal settlements in the west bank, despite every Israeli online swearing that ""most Israelis hate Netanyahu and settlers!!!"".

There are antisemetic elements at play for sure, but don't be suprised when Isreal slowly loses the support of the world and the U.S. The (western) far right is working overdrive to push normie right wingers towards isolationism, and democrats are increasingly becoming pissed at being pushed around by bibi. Eventually democrats are gonna get tired of being Insulted by bibi and throw in the towel. They already allowed a vote against Israel in the UN to go through.

1cfhd44,l1qn11d,GiantSequioaTree,"Your internal logic seems to be deeply flawed (ironic considering you are a CE prof). Why are students protesting now? I cannot answer definitively but I can certainly say that your assertion of antisemitism is a very large conclusion to leap to. Here are some other possible explanations. 

1) The nature of Gaza — bombings of hospitals, executions of bound prisoners, denying food aid, killing journalists — these are all incredibly incendiary acts, the fact that they provoke outcry makes complete sense. 
2) The recency of Gaza — as you said, one crisis has been going since 2013, the other since 2023. Do you expect people to be protesting for Palestine in a decade? 
3) There’s far less reporting out of Xinjiang. Regardless of why this is the case (suppression) I’m sure you would agree that fewer reporters means less international exposure, which is necessary to generate momentum for protests. 
4) International outcry. The majority of UN nations are in favor of a ceasefire, this cannot be said about Uighurs. Of course that would indicate that people are more likely to protest. 

Listed reasons aside, you ignored my reply. Should students not care about Palestine? Are the people of Gaza not suffering? Has the UN HRW not declared this a genocide? Your reply is callous, and, as I mentioned above, reads like nothing more than pedantic whataboutism.",-1,1714362820.0,t1_l1qlluj

Zero protests. “No Jews, no news.” Hamas murdered over 1000 Israeli civilians on October 7th.

""In the 1970s, Britain’s National Union of Students became engulfed in a firestorm around the question of banning and boycotting “Zionist” organizations when doing so would also, necessarily, ban Jewish groups. This was the coming together of two trends: first, successful Arab governments’ outreach to young leftist activists in the West, whom they lobbied to embrace anti-Zionism to fill the void left by the winding down of the Vietnam War. Second, the expansion of “anti-fascism” efforts to focus on “anti-racism,” a much more malleable term that opened new avenues for recruitment and fundraising.""

UC uses OUR money to fund g3nocid3 and everyone here doesn’t even seem to care about that? Okay someone lit a car on fire which is obviously not good but where is the same energy and anger for the students who have paid tuition and were brutalized by police? If UCSC did it to them it could very well happen to you if you protested or speak out about anything you feel is wrong with the school. Also consider the fact that none of our loop buses are fully functional or safe?! or the fact that housing is a nightmare here? or the fact that TAs have never been paid enough? UCSC has so many problems it doesn’t seem to start with these protestors… 

Seems like these comments are just showing peoples true colors. Clearly people don’t care to protest or understand the meaning of it. Protesting is to cause a disturbance/bring attention to a pressing issue and none of them were violent until pd was called on students BY OUR OWN CHANCELLOR AND VP. I know we’ve all seen the pictures of her walking her dog and smiling as students get arrested….

This anger you see from protestor’s is not only anger at the g3nocid3 but it’s also pent up anger from all the racist incidents ucsc never addresses, violent, dangerous incidents that UCSC has put students, teachers, and bus drivers in. Don’t forget a bus driver literally D1ED because UCSC refuses to get new loop buses and spend money on students. instead they spend it on funding a g3nocid3…

UCSC has historically been a UC that is outspoken if you go here and are mad or surprised at the protests i’d encourage you to do further research about the schools you’re apply to next time you do apply cause it’s just a given it’s bound to happen at this UC with in the four years you spend here. 

The problem is clearly not protesting it’s the UC system perpetuating a cycle of constant issues by choosing to ignore the root causes (money hungry individuals that are in power) and refusing to use student money on students to keep them safe and protected….

And for all the people that are calling this an act of antisemitism I think you should consider not being such a sheeple. The government has time and time again weaponized religion against people of color and minorities. At first it was Christianity  against Judaism/AA/Asians/Latinos/POC and now it’s Christianity/Judaism against AA/Asians/Latinos/Palestinians/other Poc. Judaism as a religion is not inherently Zionist but the people who practice it have fallen into the trap of America and Israel  making them believe they are better than other people (Palestinians) because they are closer to whiteness. The only time America will accept you is if you are close to whiteness and accept capitalism (bc you benefit from it to an extent but you’re still a cog in the machine). Not all Jewish ppl are Zionist and not all Zionist are Jewish. But if you are Jewish and a Zionist think about why you feel that way and who has brainwashed you and fed you lies and information that keeps you complacent and encourages you to have mindsets that reinforce white supremacy.",-5,1717425967.0,t3_1d6mszx

1gg03gl,lum2ghg,violetferret04,"as an abled person who's noticed this as well, just a couple of notes for other abled people:

\- if there are free seats further down the bus, take those first, even if you have to sit next to someone (ooh so scary, i know). the entirety of the bus seats should be full before you consider taking the disabled/elderly designated seats as an abled person.  
i've seen so many people walk straight on to a near-empty bus and take the ADA seats because they want to sit with their group of 3+ friends -- if that's you, you're being childish, just move to other seats man. i promise you'll survive a 20 min bus ride

\- IF the entire bus is full and you sat down in the ADA seats, and you either 1) see a visibly disabled person board the bus, or 2) are asked by a disabled person if they can sit, YOU SHOULD MOVE. everyone will inherently think that someone else will move, ending up with nobody giving up their seat (and blankly staring, like OP mentioned). for psych nerds, remember the bystander effect -- if you don't act, others won't either

If you’re having difficulty with getting that reserved seating, let the bus driver know. It’s part of their job training to make seating for you.

1gg03gl,lum58fw,FoiledFeline,"This sucks and I'm sorry you have to deal with it. You probably have to just directly ask a specific person for their seat. Don't say generally ""hey I need someone to give me their seat"" or expect someone to notice your mobility aids and proactively give you their seat. It would be wonderful if that worked, but unfortunately it doesn't. You sometimes need to make someone a little uncomfortable and have a little bit of confrontation to get what you need, and that's ok. Make sure to sincerely thank the person when they stand up for you. Try to ask someone who isn't wearing headphones or talking to someone else, but don't be afraid to gently tap someone's shoulder to get their attention if no one is an ""easy target"". I kinda tune out everyone else on busses because I find them to be sensorily a little overwhelming (loud, smelly, hot), so I probably wouldn't notice that someone needed a seat unless they directly asked. But if you directly asked me I'd definitely give you my seat. If directly asking a few different people doesn't work or you get a hostile response from anyone, I'd turn around and tell the bus driver that you're disabled, need a seat, and having trouble getting someone to cooperate to give you a seat and ask if they could help you.

There are 49 Muslim majority countries and history has shown that Jewish people wouldn’t be safe if they didn’t have a majority in Israel. Obviously in a perfect world this wouldn’t be the case.

1ckargl,l2mxk26,[deleted],"It seems like Israel never agreed to a two state solution in any of your examples. The closest they came were agreements to begin negotiations, which they would inevitably end after some time.


1947: The 1947 solution gave the fertile and upper class land to Israel, while allocating the poorest regions and ares unable to self-sustain to palestine. Palestine was not even recognized in this deal. Israel split up palestinian land with other surrounding countries, *not palestine*.

""A first attempt at partitioning the land in 1948 resulted in an Israeli state but no Palestinian state, and the West Bank and Gaza Strip fell under Jordanian and Egyptian rule, respectively.""

1994: Israeli extremists bomb palestinian civillians. Hamas retaliates with suicide bombers, causing Israel to back out of the two state solution negotiations. Israeli extremists assasinate peaceful palestinian leaders, further slowing progress.

""In 1994, during the overlap of the Jewish festival of Purim and the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Jewish extremist Baruch Goldstein opened fire on Muslim worshippers in the Sanctuary of Abraham above the Cave of Machpelah (also called the Tomb of the Patriarchs) in Hebron, a holy site frequented by both Jews and Muslims. The same year, Hamas, a militant Palestinian organization that likewise rejected a two-state solution, began a campaign of suicide bombings. On November 4, 1995, Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist while attending a peace rally""

2008: Hamas wins election by popular vote, Israel backs out of solution immediately despite Hamas asking for peace.

""Although some leaders of Hamas now indicated a willingness to accept a two-state solution, as well as the bilateral agreements between Israel and the PA, Israel was unwilling to negotiate with a Hamas-led government.""

2014: Palestine initially refuses to negotiate after Israel builds settlements on Palestinian terrirory, but eventually accepts. Israel ends talks shortly after because they change their policy. During this few-week time period both sides cannot come to an agreement. Leaked documents suggest this is not the fault of one side or the other specifically.

""Netanyahu implemented a freeze on settlements in the West Bank from November 2009 to September 2010. Because a freeze was not implemented for Jewish neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem, which Netanyahu insisted were not settlements, Abbas refused to meet until the last few weeks of the freeze. When the freeze ended, negotiations ceased. Direct talks did not occur again until Livni was appointed to resume the task in 2013–14. The talks fell apart after relations continued to falter and negotiators failed to make significant progress within the set timetable.""",20,1714877175.0,t1_l2mvouw

1ckargl,l35lg83,[deleted],"I think you read me wrong. I don't think protests were harmful to the civil rights movement (and never stated so). In fact, protests were very much needed. Likewise, student protests have been necessary for changing university rules concerning segregation (not that those are perfect now). 


This is just one man's opinion, but... location, location, location. 


If you want a change, and you want to protest, you should protest where the change-makers are. No one on any university campus has the power to change the Israel-Palestine conflict. Now if they were protesting administrative policies of the university, sure, protest away on campus, but they're protesting the administrative policies of D.C., and they're doing it on an unrelated campus. 


Again, just my opinion, but a university is pretty clearly an ineffective location for a war protest when the war isn't about something university has control over. At that point, I start seeing protestors as less ""trying to enact change"" and more ""happy to follow the crowd into pepper spray.""


As for the protest itself, I agree with Friedman's NY times article from today: 


""First, they (the protests) are virtually all about stopping Israel’s shameful behavior in killing so many Palestinian civilians in its pursuit of Hamas fighters, while giving a free pass to Hamas’s shameful breaking of the cease-fire that existed on Oct. 7. On that morning, Hamas launched an invasion in which it murdered Israeli parents in front of their children, children in front of their parents — documenting it on GoPro cameras — raped Israeli women and kidnapped or killed everyone they could get their hands on, from little kids to sick grandparents.


Again, you can be — and should be — appalled at Israel’s response: bombing everything in its path in Gaza so disproportionately that thousands of children have been killed, maimed and orphaned. 


But if you refuse to acknowledge what Hamas did to trigger this — not to justify what Israel has done, but to explain how the Jewish state could inflict so much suffering on Palestinian men, women and children in reverse — you’re just another partisan throwing another partisan log on the fire.


By giving Hamas a pass, the protests have put the onus on Israel to such a degree that its very existence is a target for some students, while Hamas’s murderous behavior is passed off as a praiseworthy adventure in decolonization.""

The students are specifically protesting for their colleges involvement. Ie investment of hundreds of millions in weapons manufacturers that are providing the bombs to Israel.

I'm surprised how much good it's actually doing. I stand corrected! I still don't think genocidal chants and the total destruction of Israel should be part of the protests at all, and are a sign that hate groups have entered the chat here and there, but thankfully good is still being done.

As usual, yes there is antisemitism in the world, and yes you will be able to find examples of people using this phrase in the sense you mean. But that would be a small minority.

&gt;DOHA/TEL AVIV, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday rejected Hamas' latest offer for a ceasefire and return of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was still room for negotiation toward an agreement.


&gt;Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza, proposed a ceasefire of 4-1/2 months, during which all hostages would go free, Israel would withdraw its troops from Gaza and an agreement would be reached on an end to the war.

He's had plenty of opportunities to release some or all of the hostages and has refused each time. From November:


&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a deal for a five-day ceasefire with Palestinian militant groups in Gaza in return for the release of some of the hostages held in the territory early in the war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.


&gt;The sources said the Israeli prime minister rejected the deal outright in negotiations soon after Hamas militants staged an unprecedented incursion into Israeli territory on 7 October, killing an estimated 1,400 people.


*rejected outright*, goddamn that's nasty work.


&gt;According to three sources familiar with the talks, the original deal on the table involved freeing children, women and elderly and sick people in exchange for a five-day ceasefire, but the Israeli government turned this down and demonstrated its rejection with the launch of the ground offensive.

Yes, there are theories out there that Santa Claus is really a Brownie who got ""loose,"" but that's another story).

1d7bmct,l70yh8j,AliceInBondageLand,"In the early days of the school there were a series of sacred redwood groves and circles where students built tree houses and elaborate art installations. It was bulldozed during summer break under huge amounts of controversy. I consider it a huge act of vandalism on the part of the school, but they were concerned with the ""hippie"" image of the school and wanted to ""become the college of Silicon Valley.""

Elfland occupied most of the space between Merrill and the science buildings, thousands of art pieces, incredible ""trip"" spaces, incredible talent involved for decades. All gone in a few days of clandestine bulldozers.

For more context, this was one year before ""mandatory grades"" were initiated instead of the narrative evaluation system. We lost a lot when UCSC sold out.

In this case, the demonstrators demanded that we end relationships with organizations that support our Jewish students and funders that support important student success work and happen to be Jewish organizations. They demanded that UC Santa Cruz divest from and boycott companies affiliated with Israel, a demand that the [UC Office of the President has already addressed and deemed unacceptable](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-divestment). Most worryingly, they demanded that we curtail the foundational right of academic freedom by condemning the use of funding from select federal agencies. Functionally, the encampment wanted to prevent our researchers from pursuing research related to topics with which they disagree. This is a dangerous precedent and to give in to it would undermine academic freedom and make our academic community vulnerable to the values of whatever political force seeks to prevent free inquiry.""

My advice to OP is that, of course, remain 100% vigilant and cautious during any interaction with a stranger, especially ones acting weirdly. But next time, it might not hurt to ask someone like that, “are you on anything, and do you need any help?” People who are tripping (especially ones found out wandering seemingly randomly) are often times lost, away from others who are looking for them, caught in a thought-loop, etc. And it can be very hard for those people to get help, because as you may have just witnessed, their intoxicated state often makes them come off more like a threat than anything else.

No agreement was broken, except on the UC's side. This is a clear example of the law failing the workers and unions and giving even more power to those who already have it.

The power of a union comes from their ability to collectively strike, not the legality of it. The great depression was the foundation of unions having any legal precedent, from strikes that were done entirely outside of the law. American laws are not the end all and be all, and your historical ignorance of that fact is showing.

No organization is expected to join a union. The *power* of a union comes from the workers, and that power is in their collective ability to stop working.

You look absolutely ridiculous.

2.) I show a historical example of unions working outside the law to accomplish their goal, the same goal you based your entire initial condescending argument on believe it or not, and you ignore it completely. Typical.

3.) Believe it or not, workers do not have to tell their employers that they belong to a union. Workers can also form unions within a company so they hold power over that company. Companies looking for hires should *not* know if a worker belongs to a union, that only negates the power of that union. 

If your employer knows that you're in *any* union they will just hire someone else if they can. It's easier that way for them. And if they can't hire someone else, then it doesn't really matter if your union has any ties to organizations at all now does it?

Ultimately, organizations serve only as an employer for union members who willingly admit they belong to a union. By entering into an agreement to specifically sign a contract with such an employer/organization, unions therefore hurt their own power to strike--it's completely expected and can be overriden by their employer even if the grounds to strike are legal. This can be seen in UAW's case, where their contract forced them to end their strike despite it being found legal in multiple courts. This is a clear example of the law failing UAW despite their ""legal"" protest.

Your view on unions is so surface level it's astonishing. The smallest amount of in depth analysis reveals that your entire view on unions is makes no logical sense. You're so condescending yet so completely unknowledgeable about the actual events that caused UAW to strike in the first place.",-3,1717866588.0,t1_l7ox1fv

1daokgw,l7pu82p,bautdean,"1) People at the encampment were given numerous warnings to disperse as the encampment had been declared illegal. If I recall, they started telling people to leave around 3pm and the raid didn’t start until 3am. That’s roughly 12 hours for them to say “oh shit gotta go”. I’ll have to check the videos I have as it’s been a while. 
  
People with clearly pro-Palestinian attire and keffiyehs tried breaking into the SAC by pulling in doors, trying to sneak in when someone authorized was entering, and rushing in. I know a few students were kicked out when they tried to get onto the roof when it was clearly marked as “Do Not Enter”. People were also found to have been trying to take over a building. 
  
There is a student code of conduct that needs to be followed and those were clearly violated. There are also CBAs, disciplinary measures, grievances, etc laid out in the contract. 
  
Students fought back with umbrellas, fire extinguishers, and other objects. The UCLA SJP telegram group gave out messages on fighting, defense classes, and how to fight the police. 
  
With any mob, they’re going to clear them out. They were prepared to fight. Again, I’ll have to look at MY videos starting from 3pm when police starting showing up at Wilson Plaza - 5am when the raid was about finished. 
   
Last time I checked, the people at the encampment went there at their own time, while not working. Why should my union protect me if I decide to barricade the buildings I have access to just to make a point? I’ll get arrested, charged, and face disciplinary action for what I did.

2) Precedents have been set about unions and the union I am currently in will be fighting an uphill battle due to this strike. It took them 2 years to TA and amend the current contract to get what we wanted. Bargaining is about to begin for a new contract and this just places a whole load of shit on the bargaining team. Who’s to say UC won’t call this out and won’t make concessions because of this? I know how some of the bargaining team at the UC works seeing as I’ve been to every single meeting we’ve had with them and how they like to say “Well, we’re following the contract and that’s what it says in the contract. Why should the UC change what it says?”
  
3) We are talking about the unions at the UCs. Other unions have different rules. When you apply for a job at a UC, most of the listings clearly state what union you are in such as TX, BX, CX, etc. If you are not in a union, it will say Policy 99. 
  
When I joined, it clearly said that the role was union, the manager said union, HR said union. The union has clearly made progress with all the campuses as a vote was recently ratified by the members. 
  
Also, what are you talking about? The strike was NEVER found legal by PERB. They declined the injunction and said that the UC did not meet the really high bar of serious business harm. In fact, PERB gave UAW 4811 a complaint for the strike since they didn’t try to bargain with the UC in good faith. Not long after, PERB gave the UC a complaint too.",4,1717875724.0,t1_l7p6hc7

1daokgw,l7pi2ag,Ill_Radish6965,"Here is a response from the university of Michigan to UCSC: 

Dear Members of UAW 4811, 

We, the members of the Graduate Employees’ Organization at University of Michigan, write to you to salute you in leveraging your labor power toward justice from California to Palestine. The University of California, like the University of Michigan, funds the apartheid system and genocide in Palestine, and we support your strike action for divestment in line with the Palestinian BDS call. At a time when universities and other institutions rely on the state to repress pro-Palestine activism and distract from the massacres unfolding in Gaza, we see that the UC has made attempts to secure an injunction, and now secured a TRO, as yet another tool to repress the struggle for divestment and amnesty. We write to you as trade unionists who have navigated the terrain of injunctions and TROs in the hope that our experiences can be instructive. 

Graduate workers at Michigan have gone on strike twice in the past four years, and both times, the University filed requests for injunctions. In 2020, we ended our strike immediately after the University filed an injunction due to a lack of preparation and fear-mongering within our union that prevented a grounded understanding of the process and risk involved. This premature conclusion had implications not just for us, but for the local labor movement; empowered with the knowledge that the threat of an injunction alone could break a strike, UM continued to employ this tactic against other labor unions.

In 2023, we did not back down so quickly. Even facing the threat of another injunction, we knew that our power came from our commitment to fighting for each other. Collective conversations about the risks – on the one hand, legal fines and potential arrest of union officers, and on the other hand, the cost of not winning our demands if we were to end our strike prematurely – kept us grounded. After UM filed for an injunction, we prepared to hold department meetings and vote to continue striking in the event the injunction was granted. Ultimately, a judge denied UM’s injunction, and we wielded our strike power to win serious contract gains. From West Virginia to Newton to the University of Michigan, education workers in the U.S. have shown that we can strike in violation of the law and win. 

UC wants you to think that you cannot possibly win. That is why they have filed their requests for injunction and now a TRO; not because they sincerely believe their legal arguments but because they want to zap your fighting spirit and break your political will. They want you to think you have no space to maneuver, that our struggles are not connected and the costs of standing up for yourselves and the Palestinian cause are simply too high, and that real power lies in the hands of lawyers and judges, instead of your own. Only you can determine what is actually true – what power do you have and are you willing to exert it towards divestment? 

Your decision to take strike action in pursuit of divestment and in solidarity with Palestinian workers is a testament to the possibility of building a global labor movement in the U.S. that does not stop fighting when anti-labor laws are mobilized to serve American imperial interests, but instead dares to pursue justice for all, across geographies. As Palestinian workers lead the way for all of us, you are laying a path for a global material solidarity in line with their call. We know that victory in this strike means a victory for the Palestinian liberation movement, and for all of us. Strike to win!

In Solidarity,

“The octets were the most radical of the three types [of apartments offered in Kresge], featuring a split-level plan with bathrooms located downstairs and a sleeping-living area upstairs. These units were intentionally left almost completely open, with limited opportunities for conventional ideas of privacy and only a bank of downstairs lockers for securing personal belongings. Students were given the unusual opportunity of partitioning the space themselves with curtains, furniture, and other design interventions. Only a couple of years after their completion, the university transformed the octets into sextets as the repercussions of such cohabitation became evident.”  

 It may not totally match up with what your unit is like but it sounds like some architect had some. Interesting ideas. About what the apartments should look like and that did not go well. So walls had to be added in. I don’t know do it explains the window into your bedroom though, that’s very weird.

1dopvls,ladlpy3,BioVean,"Reposting my comment here since some statements on this thread are not correct and quite concerning:

It is not true that “most” people have “genital” herpes. HSV1 commonly causes cold sores (50-80% Americans) and HSV2 commonly causes genital herpes (Only 1 out of 6 Americans). HSV1 can also cause genital herpes, but it is still more commonly caused by HSV2. 

There is vast difference in management depending on clinical presentation (cold sores vs genital).  So, yes, the OP has the responsibility to tell whoever he/she will be intimate with if he/she already knows he/she has genital herpes.

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/herpes-hsv1-and-hsv2

I want to emphasize that it is not the end of the world to have genital herpes, but disclosure and transparency is very important since it is still a lifetime of clinical management/ treatment. 

The symptoms can “clear” but the virus will remain latent in your body, meaning there is no cure for it, but outbreaks and symptoms can be managed, especially with current treatments. People with genital herpes can still have perfectly normal lives.

Then, an ex lied to me and said he had been tested for STIs &amp; we had been dating on and off for a year already- he never did until he had some weird rash on his mouth and the clinic tested him and he had HSV2.

Edit: Also wanted to add that a large part of the reason that there is a stigma today is because fricking drug companies wanted to sell herpes treatments 70-90s, so they stigmatized herpes making the drugs more appealing

Of note is that condom use is not 100% effective against anything, in particular HSV. HSV 1 and 2 can present on the mouth and genitals, and can transmit and be received from either to either. HSV can only be transmitted from an active sore, at that exact spot of the sore. The sores almost always present in the same place.

Your edit of HSV1 is at 50-80% does not speak about genital herpes since genital herpes is usually caused by HSV2. There are fewer people with genital herpes presentation than cold sores (more commonly caused by HSV1) and again there is a vast difference in clinical management.

1dopvls,lacc5vq,SantaCruzKush,"You’re a mod?

The statement ""most people have herpes"" is not accurate when broken down by specific types of herpes infections. 

Let's address this line by line:

1. ""An estimated 491.5 million people were living with HSV-2 infection in 2016...""
   - This translates to about 6.6% of the global population, given that the world population in 2016 was approximately 7.5 billion.

2. ""An estimated 3.7 billion people had HSV-1 infection during the same year...""
   - This means about 49.3% of the global population had HSV-1.

3. ""World population in 2016 was about 7.5 billion. So saying 'most people have herpes' would have been accurate in 2016 and it probably is accurate today if herpes rates haven't gone down.""
   - While HSV-1 is highly prevalent, combining both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections still does not mean that most people have genital herpes (HSV-2), which is what is typically of concern in discussions about disclosure to sexual partners.

Given these points, it is correct that HSV-1 is widespread and that a significant portion of the global population has some form of herpes. However, for HSV-2, which is the primary concern for genital herpes, the majority of people do not have this infection.

HSV2 still predominantly causes genital herpes and HSV1 type genital herpes is increasing, however, more recent studies have also shown that HSV1-type genital herpes has reduced recurrence and viral shedding than HSV2-type genital herpes, so management/treatment between the two can also differ (example CDC recommendation: suppressive therapy for HSV2 type genital herpes for both frequent and less frequent recurrences vs suppressive therapy only for HSV1 type genital herpes with frequent recurrences).

History Lesson:

The Waffen-SS unit known as the Arab Legion was founded by Palestinians in 1941/42.

They were later joined by Lebanese, Iraqi, Iranian, Syrian, Saudi, Egyptian, and other Arabs.

These same Arabs went home after the Second World War. They joined their national armies or various subunits in the case of the Palestinians. And then intended to drive Jews out of the region a second time in 2,000 years.

Unfortunately for the Arabs, the Israelis won.

And because they had so many known Nazis among their Military and Government bodies, France and Britain helped the Israelis initially. Since they were killing Nazis and doing the world a service. It was very Patriotic for their citizens. 

Of course, France eventually wanted good ties with their former colonies, and the British were struggling with financial troubles.

Eisenhower putting his foot down on the issue of the Suez Canal was a convenient means of getting out of dodge for them.

Then, the USA backed Israel out of need to allow the West to maintain an outpost in the Middle East that could and has been trusted to stay with the West.

Having been purged, the remaining Arab Nazis got together and founded the PLO, and eventually, the diehard remnants and descendants formed Hamas.

Now Hamas gets supplies and resources from Iran and Russia. The former also included Arab Nazis when the Islamic Revolution ousted the Shah, and they would go on to found the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.

As for Russia... Where else do you think Hamas got stockpiles of legit Strumgewher 44 Assault Rifles?

When KGB Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Putin fled East Germany, he took trucks loaded with Stazi resources and East German Military Resources, which included StG 44 Assault Rifles.",6,1716887652.0,t3_1d28j0n

We asked them when the stuff would be getting cleaned, and they said within a week. we ended up living in that new temporary apartment for the rest of our lease, our old unit never got cleaned, and we never got our security deposit back due to “mold damage”

and to add insult to injury all of my roommates shit had gotten destroyed because they actually listened to hilltop and left it in there, so it was swallowed by mold since hilltop never had the issue dealt with.

luckily I had said fuck their liability took all my stuff home and was able to preserve most things other than my bed and desk which got eaten through. total at least $2000 worth of damages and $1000 we never got back in the security deposit.

As for things getting cramped, it always will be. My roommate had a desktop and monitor, and they always had to stay neat and clean in order to use his space comfortably. I had a laptop and things still got cramped. I guess just be critical of what your normal living habits are and use that as a starting point!

1gse5ct,lxi4t37,OppositeHyena7070,"So, I'm first really sorry you're going through this. I think you are very brave and strong to even seek help here. So please know that. 

I can almost guarantee you that you are not alone, not trying to invalidate how you're feeling, more or less trying to comfort you in the sense that you are not alone, and there is nothing wrong with you. I'm no therapist but I've been to MANY sessions at my past CC. Which truly helped me work through a lot of my pain, hurt, anger, trauma, and things that were really hindering my growth personally and academically. I can assure you that by HIPPA laws your parents would not get notice of you seeing a therapist through CAPS. That's law mandated. The only thing they mention to you when you start a session is that if you tell them you are hurting yourself or want to do so they have to by law seek out other medical teams to better support you. But by law they can't tell your parents or send them anything if you see CAPS. I'm not sure about outside therapy though, if you use your insurance then yes, they might see it come up on a statement. Also, not sure how old you are or your situation but look into state insurance (medical). It's flipping time consuming but if you are wanting to branch off from the toxic/unhealthy family dynamic start looking into that. I wish I could help more with that but I don't want to overstep or make you uncomfortable. 

  
All I can say is maybe journal, I know writing for me personally even if it's a 3 sentence entry, does help. In time you can also use your journaling as a positive reflection or tool to see how far you've really come. Knowing that you had past struggles you overcame and seeing where you're at now kind of lifts things up. You're at a UNI. Not many people can say that, I hope you know how much of an accomplishment that is in itself. 

  
I'm not always on so my responses might be lagging but I'm more than happy to share what I know if you have any follow up questions. :)

  
Also, talk to your professors about this. I know when I went through similar periods I communicated with my professors and one of them was actually the one who guided me to therapy. School therapy. So, just know they are there to help. Don't give up. If they say they're busy explain to them you need this as you are not in a good mental space and your mental health is a priority. I hope all goes well. Reach out if you want to chat more, I felt this in my bones and I know the feeling. Sending you warm hugs and strength friend.",2,1731796210.0,t1_lxgh4yh
1gse5ct,lxefzlm,Luckycrownducky,"It looks like you’re trying real hard to find connection and previous attempts haven’t worked out :( but I can assure you people will notice. I was feeling the same way literally 3 days ago and was to put it lightly, very rash and very ready to do a little 🤪🔫  (we love depression 🥳, for legal purposes I am not admitting to this. I have assignments way past due that an admittance would GET IN THE WAY OF). 
But, I’m super lucky to have a support network, even though my brain convinced me at the time I didn’t.
Even if you don’t think you do, there are people watching out for you!

Have you tried therapy? It’s not for everyone, and it’s not the be all end all cure, but it definitely could help you get out of the mindset that you are disconnected.

I think the main thing is, you don’t have to force yourself to feel better, it absolutely sucks but it usually stems from something we aren’t addressing. I see you like to take walks so maybe walk around one of those trails tomorrow and make a voice memo of what you’re feeling and put effort into understanding why you feel this way. Or if you want to walk with someone, specifically a very poor conversationalist, I’m down :D 
What helped me most of all was to first chat with some people about what I was feeling and then sing my heart out in the forest, which I am 100% sure other hikers heard, but who cares. If I was ready to disappear, why would I care what other people thought about my Frank Sinatra impression.

- I think your family was quite rude to invalidate your feelings like that &gt;:( but if you’re feeling like this, then clearly there’s a reason to be upset. Nothing your family thinks will change that.
- I think people tend to ignore classmates unless you hang out outside of class and help them with classwork. I live right next to my classmate. A foot away, we have no talked for more than a combined 3 minutes. The man was literally bleeding and moaning in pain (had a crash on asphalt), and I was the only one who asked if he was okay and if I could help in a crowded area?
- Which I think is the final thing here, I’m from a small town in SoCal and I’m constantly told that the normal things back home, are way too nice and seen as something saint-like here. Like saying hello to everyone you see, making care packages, checking in on people, giving them food just because? It’s an interesting culture shock even though I’m only 7 hours away. There are of course people who are different, shoutout to the people working at the Porter/Kresge dining hall who give compliments as freely as they give food. But, I’ve noticed a general trend of people here acting a little more stand off-ish in the socially polite zone.

My point is it depends on what you’re looking for and who has it for what price. Not every place charges the same for the same thing. Some places make you pay for the excise taxes but others cover the tax like they are actually supposed to. 

Sorry for your loss of discount, but flavors was and still is already really cheap.

I've been called a J\*p by a student in class, called a flurry of latin slurs by people i don't know, and a kid once said 'omg hiroshima' in response to me saying i’m japanese (think he was trying to make some edgy joke. it wasnt funny).   
I'm not gonna excuse the gross acts of some people, but I will say that I am very happy I've found a crowd where I'm kept away from those types. As much as I've found students don't wanna talk about it (white guilt or wtvr other reason), I think the school's white/white-passing majority just means that people dont know how to act around BIPOC.",3,1734260615.0,t3_1hdu91d

1hdu91d,m38a2mm,jinmy50,"assuming you’re genuinely asking, it’s a belief where white people feel they bear the responsibility for the harm that’s been done against POC throughout history just because they are also white. awareness of your own privilege as a white person and acknowledgement of how racism is still imbedded in our structures is a good thing. White guilt however, can can cause some to distance themselves from POC, feeling overcome with the guilt of their ancestors actions. it does nothing to help but instead worsens the problem.

For some, white guilt also causes them to distance themselves from their white identity. This means people refuse to acknowledge their privilege or may think of themselves as “one of the good ones”. 

This can also lead to what’re known as “white saviors”, who believe that they are champions for POC struggles. This continues to take POC voices out of the spotlight.

I would ask certain locals about it that had grown up there and they said it’s always been that way but “you get used to it or just ignore those people”.

Some people just wanted to stay within their culture and didn't seem to want me interacting with their friend group (happened a few times in the case of hanging out with a mutual friend and another group).

Honestly, in everywhere I've lived, I feel like UCSC had the most racist stuff going on, though I feel like in part that is because most people here are young adults who are open about talking about stuff vs suburbs/cities where people keep to themselves.

In the same breath that you attempted to reduce the actions of a ""small minority"", you then made a claim about how ""UCSC isn't even making the national news"" indicating that you wouldn't attempt to reduce the actions of the ""small minority"" if in fact said ""small minority"" was making national news - i.e. you would be favorable to the views of ""a small minority"" if it made national news. But since that supposedly hasn't happened with UCSC, the efforts of ""a small minority"" at UCSC are futile and hold zero weight to you.

Those who stand on the side of justice and humanity recognize that the actions of Hamas are unjustified; those who stand on the side of justice and humanity also recognize that Israeli action against all Palestinians in Gaza because of the actions of Hamas is unjustified.

1dcualz,l81r274,quarrelreef,"Isn’t israel holding several thousands of palestinians as political prisoners, many without any charges? Many of them children under the age of 18? Wasn’t that the reason hostages were taken on Oct. 7th, when in the past one Israeli hostage has been exchanged for dozens of Palestinian prisoners? Haven’t israeli news sources been proven to, and even admitted to have published unverified and false reports of “beheaded babies” in order to justify their aggressive response? Haven’t numerous reports shown that many lives lost on Oct. 7th were from reckless firing by IDF helicopters? Haven’t several freed captives described a scorched earth response from the IDF in which their fellow hostages were blown to pieces along with militant targets by the forces supposed to save them? Haven’t hundreds of civilian casualties, including children, been repeatedly deemed collateral in bombings to target numbers of Hamas operatives in the single digits? Isn’t israel indiscriminately flattening hospitals, universities, and refugee camps in Gaza? Aren’t they also increasing illegal expansion and settlement efforts into the West Bank, a region not under Hamas control, resulting in numerous civilian casualties?

I’m not trying to devalue one human life in comparison to another by posing these questions in retort to yours. I’m trying to illustrate with the same line of questioning as you that the Israeli government is inflicting, and has always inflicted, violence several orders of magnitude greater than has been inflicted on them. If you justify the violence used by Israel because it is in response to the violence used by Hamas, then shouldn’t that violence itself be responded to with an even greater violence? Shouldn’t Hamas have been justified in their violence because of the violence and repression inflicted on the Palestinian people since the inception of the Israeli state?

I’m not trying to argue that justification because I don’t believe in endless cycles of humans crushing each other and erasing countless innocent families from existence because it was done to them before. I’m trying to say that if you ARE arguing that force justifies force, then the force is far greater and more destructive coming from the Israeli side, so why wouldn’t that beget force such as hostage taking and rocket firing (at the world’s most advanced rocket defense system) in response? 

I don’t believe that violence and war is the solution to achieve peace between differing peoples. The quandry here is that without responding forcefully to violence, you risk being wiped out along with your families, and never living to see that peace occur. But violence with no end is cruel and in many ways turns your struggle, in the eyes of your enemy, into the exact thing you are trying to avoid for yourself and your family. 

Israel has refused several ceasefire requests from Hamas in exchange for releasing hostages. If “all they cared about,” as they often claim, is the release of the hostages, why would they refuse numerous offers to return them? Why would they result to artillery tactics against buildings they know have hostages in them? A dead hostage benefits Israel more than a living one. A living hostage can show the world that negotiations ARE possible. A dead one is just a casualty of war and another thing to pin on Hamas. I encourage you to listen to stories of hostages that have been released, if you can. Not from those of them that describe humane and respectful treatment by their captors, but from those who describe seeing their neighbors and family members blown apart as collateral by the IDF forces who had supposedly come to rescue them. This isn’t about hostages. This isn’t about rockets. They’re already starting to plan beach resort developments on the leveled coastal neighborhoods while people starve and are killed in REFUGEE CAMPS. In addition Israel is destroying foreign human aid workers aiding refugee camps. 

The point of this isn’t to shake my fist and curse the nature of war and the violence of humans. It’s to explicitly accuse the state of Israel of using this invasion and “war against Hamas” as a convenient excuse to annex Gaza, and ultimately the West Bank, and clear out the civilian population that lives there, dead or alive. This is blatantly obvious when you look at the civilian death tolls in comparison to the number of Hamas militants that have actually been killed. The fact that Mossad could likely erase anyone from the face of the Earth and yet widespread annihilation of hospitals, aid trucks, universities, residences, and known hostage sites is somehow the only way to eliminate Hamas operatives. The genocidal rhetoric of the Israeli government comparing Gazans to vermin that must be exterminated. The fact that Oct. 7th was even able to happen. The intentional exaggeration of the violence that was inflicted in order to justify a scorched earth response. 

It’s the same way that I can’t understand how an attack that killed 3,000 Americans, despite the horrific nature of that attack, justifies an invasion of Iraq (a country not involved in the attack) that results in ~500,000 (some sources claim a million) civilian casualties because “they have WMDs” (a claim the US government issued knowing there was no proof of this). Except I do — propaganda. We have all been conditioned to accept the indiscriminate deaths of countless thousands of people from across the world as an “acceptable loss” in order to further the military ambitions of Western nations. It’s the same in Gaza right now. Don’t let them sell you that",15,1718067020.0,t1_l81me4m
1dcualz,l8233n6,NoNewPuritanism,"Don't worry, Israel does not want to annex the west bank and gaza. Much like the surrounding middle eastern countries, Israel does not want accept millions of palestinians into their territory. Nor does Israel want to perpetrate a genocide. If they were they wouldn't have allowed the population to increase in the last 20 years leading up to this war. Israel simply wants to be left alone.

You have clearly swallowed the propaganda from Iran. You see the reports about humane treatment. I've seen reports about [beatings and death threats](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/freed-israeli-hostages-tell-families-beatings-death-threats-2023-11-29/). Hamas is an unorganized collective, so maybe there were some groups that treated the hostages they were responsible for humanely. It doesn't discount the fact that they were fucking kidnapped and removed from their daily lives, and that's not mention Stockholm syndrome. 

Mossad isn't made of super soldiers, and neither are Israeli special forces. Look at Grozny, Look at fallujah. Soldiers die in Urban combat. Israel simply does not want to let Israeli soldiers die, so they do everything by air. This leads to more collateral. There is not higher or deeper meaning to Israel's tactics. 

Hamas has never requested a ceasefire solely for releasing hostages. Hamas asks for nearly 10 times more Palestinians to be freed from Israeli prisons (many of whom undertook terrorist attacks on Israeli soil in the past). If Hamas solely asked for a ceasefire in return for all Hostages, Israel would accept immediately.

1dcualz,l825h96,quarrelreef,"1) you guys need to look up a definition for freedom fighter. It is very similar to the definition of a terrorist. It does not equal “good guys.” 

2) i didnt intend for this post to be a setting for a debate on the israeli invasion of palestine. Although i certainly and seriously contributed to that. The point was, what the fuck are people supposed to do besides protest if the school isn’t willing to divest from this conflict without outside encouragement. And to acknowledge that it feels bad to be affected negatively by protests but things don’t just happen on their own, without mass displays of resistance to norms that some of us find unacceptable. 

3) Myself and everyone else I know of Jewish descent are staunchly against the mass slaughter of Palestinian civilians in order to eliminate Hamas. This does not make me pro-hamas. I started to pose questions counter to people’s challenges about the conflict in order to demonstrate that violence begets violence, and those saying “what about hamas?” have refused to acknowledge the atrocities of the Israeli government that provoked Hamas’ response. I am not trying to say that Hamas’ response — massacring civilians — is “good” or morally pure. But i find it hypocritical to say that hamas killing civilians and taking hostages is justification for israel killing 20x as many civilians in response, especially when considering the hundreds/thousands of Palestinians sitting in Israeli prison, many of them children and many more facing no actual charges despite years of detainment. That justification is what I am arguing against.",0,1718073043.0,t1_l81r274

1dcualz,l8665xh,quarrelreef,"Please scroll up in this very comment thread. Where i say that I find it unacceptable to lay waste to civilian populations by the tens of thousands all in order to target a few hundred, or thousand, terrorists (just my opinion teehee!). Even if the Israeli estimate is accurate that they killed 10,000 Hamas fighters (which I strongly disbelieve), to me it doesn’t justify burying 7-14k CHILDREN. Bombing refugee camps with children and babies in them in order to free hostages, rather than doing a prisoner exchange, doesn’t feel justified to me. 

And the immediate reply was, “aren’t they still firing rockets at israel and holding hostages?” Who? The civilian population? Oh, no you mean Hamas? Okay so Hamas’ actions then… you could say…. JUSTIFY the Israeli response of bringing mass destruction to Gaza? Knowing full well the disproportionate loss of civilian life that would ensue? To me that screams justification. So don’t bullshit me and say that I’m the only one “justifying” anything. The only thing I wanted to justify with this post was the strikes and protests as the only tangible way to achieve change in institutions like ours where the Regents are protecting their pockets while us students are seeking dignity and to represent an establishment that they can respect and feel represented by in return. Suddenly the comments turned into “well what about Hamas? They killed people!” To which i say that does not justify the slaughter of tens of thousands of civilians. And then you say “you’re justifying Hamas’ actions! You’re anti-semitic!” Bro I am part Ashkenazi Jew please don’t make me laugh. I am not trying to justify the actions of Hamas. I am trying to point out that, when you say “but hamas killed people!” You ignore that israel killed people. And is now killing more innocent people than Hamas could ever dream of. And if you can justify Israel’s use of this amount of deadly force against civilians because it is in response to Hamas’ violence against them, I fail to see how that does not justify more, even greater use of force from Hamas in response to Israel’s violence.

(This is a ridiculous analogy, but imagine if 100 terrorists had just killed 25 people, wounding 30 more, in downtown SC and now were hiding out in porter B. Now imagine the national guard bombs the building, killing 80 of the terrorists. Now imagine 250 students were also killed from the blasts, including 50 children from FSH being crushed by rubble, and 300 more were injured in the damage. Is that an appropriate response? Is the reckless and wanton loss of civilian life on this scale worth the execution of military goals? Worth avenging the innocents who died? If I was killed by a terrorist I hope to whatever God there is that it doesn’t become a justification for warmongers to wipe out a dozen families just to get my killer. Maybe those who kill others do deserve death. But how many more must be killed to deliver that punishment to them? At what point is it not worth the cost of human life?)",2,1718138056.0,t1_l82o9mn

1dcualz,l86u61a,quarrelreef,"They are bombing hospitals. They are bombing universities. They do not care if Hamas is there or not. If Hamas isn’t there, they can simply say they had reliable intel. They can plant evidence. It has been done. There are people who have compiled and shared so much news from the last 8 months detailing the inconsistencies of Israeli military reporting surrounding the criteria used to determine missile strike targets. 

Netanyahu allowed Hamas to rise to power in order to cut off the Palestinian Authority from Gaza and weaken their attempts at forming a Palestinian state. This is generally known policy in Israel, who had known about Hamas’ plans to act on Oct. 7th for months in advance, with official reports saying they dismissed the attack as impossible to execute. Hamas’ aggression has always been used as justification for stripping Palestinians of rights and essentially imprisoning them in Gaza, which the Human Rights Watch and dozens of other organizations label as the “world’s largest open-air prison.” It is politically convenient for the Israeli government to allow Hamas to remain in power. I encourage you to look into this and research it independently. They set the stage for Hamas to take over knowing they would pursue a military agenda against Israel because then they can tell the world they are justified in their actions. They will tell the world “we are simply taking back what is ours.” And the world will nod and we will tell each other that it doesn’t matter how many thousands of mothers and fathers and babies and lovers and friends and families must be blown apart in order to defeat the Hamas devils. And the world will not ask Israel how it is that Hamas came to power, and what instigated the lasting conflict that has culminated in this destruction today. They will not ask why the United Kingdom and United States are allowed to build nations on top of existing ones, and crush the people underneath for a hundred years until they are all squeezed out. They will simply cheer on as the terrorists are killed, not noticing the tears mixed into the rivers of blood they now stand in.",2,1718146682.0,t1_l86ovr1
1dcualz,l86xukj,quarrelreef,"In august 2023 there were over 1,200 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons without charges, ability to hold trial, or release dates. As well as 3,000 additional prisoners facing charges, some just for protesting peacefully. The hostages taken were a bargaining chip for the release of Palestinian political prisoners. Israeli military reports claim that 20 of these are between age 16-18. 70% of Gazans are refugees, and 50% are under the age of 18. For every 2 civilian casualties in Gaza, one is likely a child. Of the 1 million projected to be starving in Gaza by July, 500,000 will be children. So for me the outcome where half a million kids starve and 10,000 more are burnt to a crisp isn’t the one I can support. But you go ahead and cheer on as Hamas is destroyed, with only the cost of every human being in Gaza being displaced, wounded, starved, or killed. 

Look up Yasmin Porat. She was held as a hostage in Be’eri in the Oct. 7th battle, and a Hamas soldier released her and surrendered to the IDF, who had the neighborhood they were in surrounded. IDF soldiers “rescued” the 12 other hostages held captive by Hamas by firing a tank into the building they were in, killing nearly all the hostages. 

Look up the Hannibal Directive, in regard to Israeli prisoners being taken by retreating enemy fighters: ""the kidnapping must be stopped by all means, even at the price of striking and harming our own forces."" Supposedly this policy ended in 2016. 

IDF Air Force Col. Nof Erez claimed that Oct. 7th was a “mass Hannibal” where the directive was “apparently applied.” 

12-year-old Liel Hastroni was one of the Israeli hostages killed by IDF tanks in the Be’eri massacre. Her burnt body was shared on social media along with claims that Hamas had done this to her for being Jewish. These kinds of reports helped to drum up international support for the coming scorched Earth response, and to dehumanize Palestinians in the public eye.",2,1718148155.0,t1_l86u61a

Hell my Grandpa served in Vietnam and he even says we should never have gone. To go even further the Vietnam protests were very unpopular when they were occurring while today they are seen as absolutely necessary and have high support so the only explanation for the 180 in public opinion is that the protesters were eventually vindicated as many see the Vietnam war as how the protesters saw them at the time. What was once marginalized is now mainstream opinion much like how the civil rights era was eventually vindicated.

1d38rht,l6cvboh,Chuyzapatist,"No protest is timely, just saying. But yeah the other point makes sense. This reminds me of the time almost 10 years ago now when students chained themselves together to block highway 1 to protest literally a bunch of stuff at once like blm, UC grad student stuff, conflicts in Syria at the time, and whatever else all rolled into one. Reason I know it was so broad was because I knew one of the people who chained themselves and was one of the organizers and when I asked them why they did it they listed those things.

They ended up blocking highway 1 from ocean st for several hours during morning commute traffic and all they did was make the already strained relationship between the town and the school even more strained while getting themselves arrested, expelled and I believe some court ordered community service and probation. No one gave a crap about what they were there for, they just wanted to get to work and thought that a bunch of people who chained themselves to each other and then to cement blocks was the dumbest reason for being late to work by several hours.

All those causes are just and shouldn’t be confused with the actions of a bunch of main characters who want media attention at the expense of their fellow students or bystanders. All that’s happening here is a valid initial reaction of “why is this happening to me? Why am I being dragged into this? I got blah blah blah to do!” That’s all fair, these protesters should be punching up not down or sideways. 

There are other things they could be doing that affects the regents rather than the students and staff who for the most part agree that what’s happening in Gaza is a historic atrocity but feel that there isn’t much they can do. Now these people are pissed and maybe will have a harder time separating a messed up thing happening halfway around the world with this messed up thing happening at them for what feels like no reason to them right here when they just wanna finish their classes and go home.

Anyway to those of you affected by blocked entrances you’re valid in your frustration, but please try not to let it affect your overall sense of right and wrong just because a bunch of people feel like they need to make you pay attention to current events in a way that directly affects your life in this moment. At the end of the day, this will work out most likely for you when it comes to your grades and finals.  and to those struggling with health conditions and are affected by this im so sorry, that really sucks and i really hope you get whatever you need in a timely manner.

1hll5nn,m3n8386,DragonfruitWZRD,"Im an alumn, when I was a freshmen I felt the same thing. Lonely despite having a good group of friends and being busy with social life and school. Wished there was more school spirit, a sports team, a lot of things my friends from home had at their respective universities. 

In the end I stayed and loved it. A few friends (small amount) left and transferred or dropped out for personal reasons. The ones who stayed, and me, still wished some of those things. 

But at the end of the day, for me it was more a matter of adjusting to everything that college is. Being away from home, your friends you may have known for years, home cooked meals… but also adjusting to everything NEW while feeling pretty empty inside. 

I think this adjustment period might follow you in many new places. Yes, schools with more school spirit as you said, may have more things to distract you from that feeling of adjustment, but that could just be at face value. 

In my experience, for all that me and my friends complained about UCSC, we also grew with it. I met up with 2 of my best friends recently and we all agree we wouldn’t have changed that experience. 

I think you grow with it. And it is a pretty unusual experience in many aspects lol. You’re not in a city and the city isn’t the most accessible. There’s a lot more I could list off that made ucsc a hard adjustment. 

But again, speaking personally, I wouldn’t have changed it and I always tell people I love my experience there. At the end of the day, I think the people around you are what really shape your experience. I have a very hard time to any life adjustments and it did take a while, like more than a quarter or two to feel more settled, and it happened gradually. 

Like I said, I personally grew with it. Those walks around campus sometimes felt lonely at times, but I also grew to love them 

If you’re feeling overwhelmed with it all, and the option to transfer, that’s definitely understandable and I think you should think about your options. But also just remind yourself you’re doing a huge new thing, and sometimes it takes time. But again, speaking personally. 

Be proud that you’re making a step and actively thinking about what’s best for you! Just don’t try to force your brain into of all your options 100% of the time. Maybe you just need to live it out a bit more?

The recreation department also seemed relaxed and welcoming. All that seemed to click within the first year. That said, I do think there are friendlier atmospheres in general on other campuses, so if you really don’t feel at home at UCSC perhaps you could visit some other schools - or do a year abroad program somewhere?

Like, however college is portrayed in an Extremely Goofy Movie, SC was the opposite. No sports or school spirit, no central quad alive with students, few good study areas, few vast lecture halls (45 people in a classroom will get old fast), a pathetic gym (seriously, a great gym is a staple of most 4-year school experiences), no bona fide Greek life, a campus layout which quite actively inhibits student congregation, no sense of a “college town” (but rather a town locale distended by a hill and which seems to have 0 interest in embracing or even acknowledging its UC student population), parties? ha!… and the students…. Let’s just say the facilities are only half the problem in terms of a lack of socialization. I was super lonely. Not to disparage anyone reading this, but I felt like almost everyone I’d meet was introverted, awkward, plain old weird, or even downright mean-spirited. I was pretty unhappy there my first two years. But I’ll say this: finding just one good friend, and learning to love my environment, I learned to love life in sc by the end. SC is quite literally one of the most beautiful environment in California, and getting to live in a small town right on the ocean and in the mountains like that is something I dearly, dearly miss now that I’ve moved. Somewhere in my junior year or so, I began to care less about the “college experience” I had missed—those things listed above—and started to view my time there almost  as like a 4-year educational vacation. (My family is not wealthy, either, but I was able to afford housing. If you’re below that threshold, SC will be one of the greatest nightmares you can imagine. But, I’ll assume you’re not.) The town is small enough to be laid-back and comfortable, aside from the homeless. The air is fresh, the scenery is unbeatable. Hiking, running, beaching, surfing, bikeable small town, redwood mountains, tide pools, etc. are the kinds of things people pay millions to live around. Learn to enjoy some aspect of that, and I assure you you’ll be missing it by the time you have to leave.
But, maybe that’s just not you. Maybe you’re not someone who’s going to have a profound love for living oceanside, or in the forest, or ever get over the soreness for missing a typical college experience.

I was at Kresge and part of what made me feel isolated was that it felt like most of the people around me valued the experience and they thought they were in heaven and I didn’t get it. Every quarter got better and by the end of my first year I was totally hooked. UCSC was a deeply transformative experience for me. When I graduated I got massively depressed because I knew it was an exceptional time in my life that I’d never get back again, with peers also going thru exciting and massive life changes, and being able to be intellectually and socially stimulated in a stunning environment. I still ache for my time at UCSC and occasionally have dreams that I moved back to Kresge for grad school. I’m a 50 year old professor, which I semi process when I have these dreams, so it’s exciting but also awkward as you can imagine (and my kids are somehow not in the picture, but I think my husband is?). This might not be your trajectory but I can’t help but think it takes a while for many of us to settled into the UCSC experience. I went to grad school at UCI and felt pretty badly for the undergrads there. The academics were strong but the campus culture wasn’t very interesting, at least when I was there.

I thought it would be a good opportunity for change, but I mostly transferred due to my dad pressuring me. However, I feel like after coming to UCSB, I really realize how precious UCSC was. It takes some time to feel comfortable there, I mean I was only starting to feel at home at the end of my second year. But there are experiences in UCSC you can’t get at any other university. You’ll find students playing music in porter meadows, east field, just about any big patch of space. If you look you’ll find tree nets to take refuge in (literal flat nets in the trees that you can lay in safely. You can hike up to beautiful places like the koi pond, garden of Eden (a giant pool of natural water), there’s another secret spot if you go visit the cows just off campus too. Another thing helped was the GE’s. UCSC has some of the best GE’s, there’s literally a Harry Potter class, a horror movie class, muppets, jazz history, west African dance, music production, and my favorite class of all time: meaning love and paradox that’s offered in spring (one time we made balloon flowers for homework). Most of these classes are easy A’s, genuinely interesting, and you can meet some cool people in them. Explore the campus, there’s so many hidden secrets. Aside from the tree nets and natural waters, you can go into the music building and play the pianos when nobody is occupying the space!

1ck3mlb,l2kgh7w,UltraBatmanTheSeven,"There have been multiple climate protests on in the past few years. I was heavily involved with a major climate group before I graduated last year. They just put on an Earth Day teach-in and march, which admittedly, I heard did have low attendance. Part of the reason things have slowed down recently might be that we actually won some key victories. A major demand was that our university begin the process of decarbonizing and moving towards the shutdown of the campus methane plant. Our march on Earth Day 2022 actually got us a meeting with the chancellor where we made our case. She actually started a planning process which got us an [plan to decarbonize](https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/initiatives/decarb-electrific.html) (potentially) by 2030! But I do hope students keep an eye on that to make sure it gets implemented.

Obviously there is a lot more the university can do for climate too though, and one of them is actually financial divestment from fossil fuel-supporting firms and banks. So to be honest I'm not really disappointed that climate is not in ""the spotlight"" right now. When students and youth make their voices heard, and especially when they win, it sets the precedents that push our voices forward. In the case of recent protests demanding divestment/isolation from Israel, If the students succeed, it will undoubtedly make fossil fuel divestment/denormalization a lot easier. In fact it may even happen at the same time, considering many of these problem firms are the same (BlackRock, etc).

One can be a driver and still fight and work towards changes in access to quick and efficient public transit, so that they can eventually decrease their car-dependency. They can fight for the increase in public bike paths (like that Santa Cruz greenway proposal) for those that can use it, even if they themselves will never use them. It’s not hypocritical to use a car in an area that essentially requires one to get around.

Though we obviously do also need to expand our long-distance rail infrastructure in order to reduce the GHG emissions from aircraft.

Fukushima occurred in 2011 and the reactors that failed were General Electric Mark I boiling water reactors, which are pretty much identical to every commercial plant that is operating around the world today, even the ones that were built with quote-unquote *modern* technology. Some countries implemented very stringent regulations in the wake of Fukushima to decrease the likelihood of radioactive gas being released into the atmosphere during a meltdown, but the US was not one of these countries, as the NRC is a captured agency that has long prioritized industry profits above public safety. Nuclear reactors in the US are as susceptible today as they were during the Cold War to flooding, earthquakes, wildfires, water shortages, terrorist attacks, or anything else that would cause the power to go out for even a short period of time. 

Furthermore, nuclear plants are extremely expensive (about $112-189 per MegaWatt-hour, compared to $36-44 for solar and  $29-56 for onshore wind), making it difficult for them to compete with renewables on the free market. See Vogtle Units III &amp; IV in Georgia as an example, which finally came online last week more than $21 billion over budget and 8 years behind schedule due to construction delays. France, China and South Korea’s nuclear capacity has mushroomed in recent decades mainly as a result of generous government subsidies and state-owned electric utilities. Such growth would not be possible under US capitalism. Given nuclear power's risks and the fact that we still have no permanent geologic repository in which to store the waste, I think this is a good thing, in my humble opinion. We should be saving our limited financial resources for solar, wind, battery capacity, and other real solutions to climate change.",1,1714857293.0,t1_l2l9usl

That’s why they tend to die off after a few years without any real change being enacted.

Ie, #metoo was 10 years ago, #blm was five years ago, #freeukraine was three years ago… none of those people are any safer now.

Share a room with one or more people.

Reduce or eliminate meat from your diet.

Only buy lower-carbon-emitting foods.  Other than having a local garden, local factory farms are the way to go for efficiency.  A lot of local organic and small farms end up being less efficient on overall emissions than factory farms.

Take mass transit, walk, and bike, but don't have a car.

Don't ever fly.

Never use HVAC.

Never use AI.  

Reduce your web searches while you're at it.  

Stay off the internet in general.  

Avoid electronic gaming.  

Stay off your phone.  This includes TikTok and social media.

Only wear used clothing, and when it wears down, patch it.  The fashion industry massively contributes to carbon emissions.

In the winter of 1999, a friend of mine committed suicide in the Porter A Building. It was a traumatic experience for everyone that year. 

Several years after this, someone who had never heard about this, came running up to me during spring break in tears. He explained that he saw a bloody figure in the location where my friend died. After that, there were always rumors of a ghost in that corner of the building.

1d7znvu,l74fvvo,throwra_3387,"I’ve heard of people seeing sasquatches in the woods on campus and up in the mountains. I’ve never experienced it myself, but I remember a few years back I’d see a post about it every so often. There are a lot of stick lean-tos and other structures on campus that are often attributed to Bigfoot, but I’ve always figured they were student built. I also remember hearing about a deer kill somewhere in upper campus back during Covid, the bones being strewn about, but I’m not sure I can chalk that up to Sasquatch necessarily.

Everyone’s heard of the Porter ghost stories. I know someone mentioned a suicide in 1999, but there are ghost stories from Porter dating back to before the Loma Prieta earthquake in ‘89. While some stories are apparitions, most seem to be unexplainable foot steps and similar experiences. In a dorm building with pipes running through basically every room, I’m assuming that the pipes are responsible for some (though certainly not all) of those experiences.

Outside of that, I’ve personally found giant mushrooms in the woods that I can’t explain. Far too big for anything that’s supposed to be growing there. Of course, I never find anything but the stalks and bits of the cap. I’ve never seen a full mushroom of considerable size, but based on the size of the stalks they must be massive. I’m 6’0” and a bit on the chunky side and I’ve found stalks larger than my forearm. Not a ghost story or even necessarily paranormal, admittedly, but interesting nonetheless. Given the magic much of the campus is alleged to be subject to, I guess it makes sense.

Also saw a UFO fly over campus once. I’m not sure what it was, too quick and silent to be a plane or a drone. Just a series of red lights, moving in a V formation very quickly over Porter meadow. Lasted all of about 10 seconds before they were too far out to get a picture of. I was sober, before anyone asks.

Outside of campus, there are multiple Victorian era homes that are rumored to be haunted. I know the purple one downtown is supposed to be. Ocean Street Extension near the freeway entrance is also supposedly haunted by a girl in white. And, though it’s most likely been explained by now, the Moore’s Beach Monster that washed up at Natural Bridges back in 1925 was for almost a century a complete mystery. It’s now thought to have been a decaying Baird’s beaked whale, but they’re not generally known to swim close to shore so I’m not sure how likely it is that’s the actual answer. Of course, like most things of that era, no one thought to collect samples of it or anything so who knows.",3,1717534965.0,t3_1d7znvu

There were also at least 3 incidents in the common room where I was sitting (a few times alone and once with friends) where the microwave turned on by itself and just starting running.

It’s like how if you’re in a car and a biker is in your lane, you don’t **have to** swerve into the opposing car lane blindly, you should slow down until it’s safe to pass. Just like how if you’re on foot and there’s someone in front of you, you shouldn’t blindly swerve into the bike or car lane to get around them either.  

In the end, the width of sidewalks, bike lanes, and car lanes isn’t always going to match up with the traffic density. People should be careful and respectful, but you “navigating” into the car lane with cars zooming past to avoid walkers is the same as walkers navigating into the bike lane to avoid slower walkers while bikers zoom past.

Sure, I can navigate my way around people, but it starts getting frustrating when I have to do that multiple times in an area when pedestrians aren’t supposed to be there (in an area that is also dangerous for them too).",10,1728960617.0,t1_lrz7uv6

So I looked it up, and apparently bikes are allowed in the car lane even if there’s a dedicated bike lane, so you *could* just ride entirely in the car lane through those areas (I’m assuming mostly from baskin to crown?).

4. **Can Masdeu in Barcelona, Spain** - An abandoned hospital occupied in 2001 and turned into an ecological living and community space.

5. **The High Line in New York City, USA** - Initially an elevated rail line, it was transformed into a public park after advocacy by community groups.

Check out the curriculum chart for the CS BA, there's a lot of interesting CS-adjacent classes that don't require any actual programming. You can replace 4 of the upper divison CS courses with those non-CS electives. You still have to take 4 CS upper-divs (your choice) but it gives you the option to avoid the really painful classes (and some of the more useless ones too). Upper division classes are a little more fun btw, I'm having a good time taking some of the machine learning classes even though algorithms and C makes me want to puke. Keep in mind if you ever want to get a real software engineering position your skills will be... patchy, but if you're considering some other fields it might be worth a shot. 

Definitely talk to your advisor and consider all your options. You're still early on so it's not too late to switch to another major.",9,1732122862.0,t3_1gvnni3

Generally this was met with shock and concern, but the point I made was that UCSC is great at fostering young people to figure themselves out and pursue what inspires them the most. I’d also note that we can even create new majors with faculty support!

So to answer your question, yes lots of people go through this. Being able to rediscover yourself is a rare opportunity so take advantage of it! Have a professor you like? Chat with them in office hours about what path you might want to go on. Think there’s a unique issue with the world you want to fix? Focus on that and let it guide you to the right major. There’s no wrong answers, you just need to apply yourself whole heartedly. If CS isn’t what makes you want to do that, don’t waste your time. Find something that interests you and use the resources/professors at your disposal to make the most of it. 

It’s scary, but if you can find something to study that is important to you, it can change your life. Good luck!",7,1732130005.0,t3_1gvnni3
1gvnni3,ly5mkos,UCSC_CE_prof_M,"First, it’s not an uncommon story. Several years ago, I was in a meeting where faculty in the arts were complaining about how many students in their classes hated CS but were pressured into doing CS.

If you don’t at least like (if not love) CS, find a different major you *do* like. It’ll suck spending your life doing something you hate, even if it does pay well. And if you hate it, you probably won’t do well in your job, and are less likely to have a successful career that pays well.

It’s common to switch majors, and the good news is that it’s easier to switch away from CS than into CS. It’s not too late.",8,1732134847.0,t3_1gvnni3
1gvnni3,ly4yldy,tru-sensei,"I started as a CS major in 2016 then swapped to TIM when declaring at the end of my second year. (I was between TIM and Econ but took Tim since I was able to pass data structures with a C). 

I couldn’t stand CS. TIM has a bit of flexibility with career choices, but I found the lower div TIM classes a bit useless and easy. I didn’t know what career paths there were until I was about to graduate. I also didn’t realize what the whole point of the TIM major was until I took capstone in my last year. So, if you swap to TIM, make sure you network and explore early. You can definitely apply for an engineering program/project management (EPM) internship and pursue it as a career path. 

I’m currently not an EPM but a lot of what I do is program based so basically a program manager without the title.

As for starting your astrophysics path at UCSC, congratulations! I would like to share that surviving around the bay area may be difficult if you don't find all the necessary safety nets. For starters, the housing crisis and inflation has been a challenge during my time at SC. So to survive and not go into debt I went on and found these following resources: Calfresh (snap program, provides a monthly grocery allowance to you), slug support (surplus insurance from UCSC by students for students, if you ever need financial help they can provide a hand), MSI/ACE tutoring program, scholarships sources like stem diversity, physics dept undergrad summer scholarships, and networking with great, humble friends and mentors.

The UCSC physics and astro department are defined as 1 department. The astrophysics program at ucsc is one of the best research programs around the world. There are many notable faculty and researchers involved in topics like cosmology, high energy particle physics, early universe, and stellar formation. Prof. Enrico Ramirez, Prof. Sandra Faber, Prof. Michael Dine, just to name a few. Since ucsc is leading the nation with their adaptive optics facility, and it's home to the UC observatory headquarters, you'll have many amazing and once in a lifetime opportunities to get involved in a diverse collaboration and to use some of the most beautiful telescopes available in the world to observe the our vast universe with utmost precision.

When you come to UCSC it'll be a very unique experience full of growth and humbling, especially in the physics department. I have to admit that it was my physics undergrad cohort and the grad students I hanged out with who have mentored me and radicalized to understand the importance of science for the people through comradishop and solidarity. If you do come over to UCSC, don't be afraid to learn about mutual aid efforts around the area, socialize with others, and learn what life has to offer aside from your academic career. UCSC is the closest that the UC system will ever get to a true public institution that serves the public, a research institution that can provide resources to working class students in this capitalist fasc neolib hellhole, organized by the working class student workforce, and focused in cultivating a rich community of radical and out of the world ideas.

1dhrdrm,l90s4q3,bmwatson132,"If they’re still offering the hotel suite arrangement for grad student overflow, take that. It’s only $1200 a month, and everything is included, you’ll be in the middle of town almost, so you just walk like 8 minutes to the bus station and it takes you to and fro campus. 

I was a grad student from 21-22, so we were at the end of Covid(omicron variant forced us to go remote for a month or so), so bc of that we were allowed to live in the hotel all year since they basically had minimal business at that time and they were happy to have people in the rooms. I looked into the old pre-Covid contracts, and they were for 1 quarter only, then you had to find your own place, however there were only like 10-15 or so of us in the hotel, so with all the difficulties students have finding housing, and the limited number of spots on campus, I wouldn’t be too surprised if they still allow the full year contract like they did for me.

Either way, it’s worth it. At first I was afraid of not having a kitchen, and it is a slight hassle, buuuuut, just buy an electric double burner and cook on it. 

You’re definitely not supposed to have a burner, so put shower caps over the smoke alarms and open the windows just in case, then hide it on the days when the cleaning ladies are coming through for you. Frankly tho, I smoked weed every day in the room and blew it out the window and never set off any alarms, so I wouldn’t worry too much about getting busted.

At the time, they offered a suite, so it’s bigger than a little dorm, you have a living room and a bedroom, and a large bathroom. The internet was unreliable bc so many of us were using it at the same time, but they upgraded it, and it worked fine after, so assuming they still use the same hotel, you should be good.

Even if they forced you to leave after 1 quarter, you’d still have a much easier time figuring out housing once you’ve had a couple months to look in person.

Honestly, they hotel living sich made the whole thing so easy, and way cheaper, especially considering I didn’t have any roommates, and some of my cohort was in the hotel with me, so you could study or work together when needed.

Just try and make sure you get a window room, a buddy of mine had no window to the outside, just a window to the lobby, and that was depressing. He was only there mid week and then went back to Sac on the weekends, so it was do-able. I was full on living there tho, so if the room they assigned me didn’t have a window, I would have demanded a switch before moving all my stuff in.",4,1718642007.0,t3_1dhrdrm

Craigslist is where i found my place for the summer and its a single for 800 but i was literally lucky to have reloaded my page right when she posted it. Gotta rlly be on it which is a hassle.

We do need new housing, but UCSC's attempts at building housing have been delayed by the same NIMBYs that are complaining about this.

1f32mz0,lkqi5r0,llama-lime,"The city is responsible for, at a minimum, *allowing* enough housing to be built. Instead, they have created an artificial shortage of housing by banning more housing from being built in nearly every single part of the city.

Santa Cruz got a greenbelt which stopped sprawl up the coast, which was a fantastic environmental win. But the other side of the green belt is that you need to allow building up, to allow more environmentally friendly living. Instead, we have induced tons of car traffic on Highway 1, by forcing people to live in Watsonville and commute. Santa Cruz has also decimated the mountain ecosystem by forcing sprawl development all throughout the Santa Cruz Mountains, which is a serious problem for mountain lions and other fauna. 

Recent state law has started forcing cities to allow slightly housing to be built. But the powerful landowning side of Santa Cruz (landlords and homeonwers) mightily resist more homes, because more housing means lower rents.  There's also a false-environmentalist sensibility that single family homes with lawns are somehow better for the environment than dense living. This is of course completely ridiculous, but unfortunately very common in older populations, that like to think their big lawn is a sign of living in ""nature"" and therefore better for the environment.",2,1725052449.0,t1_lkmesfb

And the amount of actual new housing is absolutely tiny compared to the need. Seriously, add up all those new units, how many years (up to a decade) it takes to get a building going, and you will find it seriously underwhelming.

The only reason we are getting any housing at all, even this very small amount, is because the state passed new laws overturning Santa Cruz City's ability to block housing.

There needs to be housing *all over* Santa Cruz, not a handful of large buildings *only*. This town has been unchanged for decades, so a few bulidings seem like a massive change, but in a real city that people want to live in, it should be increasding its housing stock by a minimum of 1% per year to match population growth, or more likely 2%-5% for places that are desirable where lots of people want to live.

1f32mz0,ll2ujiq,llama-lime,"&gt; because the mindless growth imperative of the UC system is applying so much pressure to the local housing situation.

This is so wrong. ""Mindless growth imperative"" shows that you have not even bothered to understand the issue. UCOP has been very moderate in its growth demands.

&gt;You are simply wrong to pretend that the new developments are only occurring downtown; 

This is not what I said! You were the one that said: ""massive new apartment complexes going up all over downtown Santa Cruz"" and I merely said ""highly visible spaces"" which was more accurate than your own words. To then say that I'm the one in the wrong is a bit funny.

As for one going up in Seabright, it must not be ""massive"" is it? It hasn't hit this map at least.

https://santacruzlocal.org/housing-and-construction/


&gt;this dismissive attitude toward the understandable concerns of the local population has really begun to grate on the larger Santa Cruz community

It's not the ""larger"" Santa Cruz community, it's a small subset of super-loud and aggressive busy bodies. People may not want to push back against you, because you are so confrontational, but I get a *lot* of support for my positions face to face, as well as online. I know this supposed ""larger"" community is a paper tiger in terms of size. It may have had the money and the power and the influence, but that is fading as it becomes smaller.

&gt; These new housing developments will transform Santa Cruz, mostly for the better I think, but there will inevitably be repercussions that the residents should take seriously.

Lol, they are so small, they do basically nothing to the community at all, except slightly slow price increases. Sure, the shady end of Pacific is going to look a lot nicer (at least for a while) but until we build enough so that we can keep prices down and families in the community, it's going to have little effect on the gradual displacement of our locals and of anybody with less than $400k/year of annual income.

 &gt; facing a budgetary shortfall of over $100 million. Maybe if the university were managing its own affairs with any degree of competence the pressure would not be so acute.

And why is that? If you think that it's UCSC's fault, then you are as bad at evaluating the university's situation as you are evaluating the housing situation. It's not like they suddenly overspent $100m. It's that funding was suddenly cut by a massive amount. And they are not allowed to keep around excess funds to smooth over the differences.

Instead, this budgetary shortfall is emblematic of the exact same greed  and parasitism that homeowners exhibit in housing. In the late 1970s, the libertarian Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association both destroyed the stable tax base of property tax, and also prevented the government from keeping extra funds year-to-year to smooth over bugetary differences (the Gann Limit). This means that California has lower taxes than Texas, but also that most of our tax revenue comes from income taxes, and especially from capital gains which are taxed as income in California. This means that the state budget is completely exposed to the business cycle of the Californian economy, which means that in good times for tech it has more money that it can spend and it's not allowed to save it, and in bad times, every agency goes through brutal cuts.

This is the fundamental greed of the generation of Boomers. And I am not at all attributing this to every Boomer, many of whom foresaw these terrible results and fought hard against them. Nonetheless, the state has been set up to completely benefit the wealthiest Boomers, at the expense of younger generations and those who work. Failure to acknowldege the basic reality that future generations face, on a UCSC subreddit, is a bit rich.",1,1725239686.0,t1_ll1sjdp

My guess is that you also find yourself often very unhappy with US foreign policy like in the case of supporting Israeli with weapons? So does it necessarily follow that you believe that US should no longer exist? 

Perhaps it does for you if you are adhering to the SJP manifesto that basically states there should be no more nations  or national boundaries globally .  However my guess is that you appreciate the US and being a US citizen and don’t want the US to disappear.  Well that’s how I feel about Israel. Watts and all We are all better off with Israel there. 

Why are so many students married to the narrative of Zionists as being in favor of genocide? I cannot tell if people are for real when they post such things?  And also why do so many SJP supporters seem to not grasp that the events of 10:7 were set into motion with prodding from Iran simply because we were actually getting so close to a new peace deal with the support of MBS and Iran didn’t want to be alienated from the new proposed alliances . 

SJP , time to grow up please and recognize the simple fact that it is not black and white like that! It is one thing to be idealistic and this can be very admirable.

3. I’m personally of the opinion that the actual teaching at UCSC is great if you make the most of it. Emphasis on making the most of it. You will have to put in work to seek out opportunities but in my experience, a great education is available if you want one.
4. Cant help here
5. Never freezing cold. Hot summers and outside of that usually partial sunlight/ slightly cloudy
6. Santa cruz is EXPENSIVE
7. I would say its pretty safe especially when compared to colleges in cities

Good Spanish department.

Possibly worst rent floor in the world though. 1/3 of the county lives 2+ to a room; tons of people living outdoors (both students &amp; regular townies). Incredibly abusive/entitled/absentee landlords, like worse than normal. You will hear a ton of stories that sound incredibly made-up and hyperbolic about how bad the housing market is but I assure you they are all true. Sets a really bad vibe over the whole place, which just coexists simultaneously with the good vibe in this weird kind of maximal/bipolar way. Even if you can hang with it, everyone around you will be stressed out by it in some way or another.

2. There's a ton of stuff during welcome week for everyone, and then a couple events per quarter. Beyond that it's stuff that your college/RAs put on. You're also in a forest and like ten minutes from the beach! So if you're into outdoorsy stuff there's a lot to do.

4. Again not sure. We do have public practice rooms though and I go in a lot to play piano and it's pretty well maintained. Haven't met an unfriendly music major either.   
5. Weather is like a little too hot in the fall, pretty cold in the winter, and perfect in the spring.   
6. The college system is kind of insane. We don't have a center of campus but rather a bunch of individual colleges with their own amenities and culture, and you choose one of them to dorm in. Your experience here is kind of dictated by which college you dorm in so def do your research on that.

8. We only have one year of guaranteed housing, but I was able to get an on campus apartment no problem my second year.

One of my best friends was in the music scene at UCSC; he loved it. Never heard of ego much but music will probably always have some people like that.

1hlooji,m3ugul8,duwwy,"hii!! current freshman here affiliated with porter college!

1) people are generally super friendly! if you’re interested in something super niche, you’re bound to encounter some people with the same interest.
I’d say there are def a few cliques but generally not so much. everyone here has been super welcoming and kind. pretty much all freshmen in porter are in one big (active) groupchat together where we often share items and send invitations to parties and events and such. as for diversity, the school is pretty diverse. you’re bound to find people from all types of different backgrounds here.

2) yes! I don’t party or drink at all and theres a lot for me to do on campus. theres a lot of clubs that host fun events + downtown always has something happening. theres a venue near campus called the catalyst that almost always has some artist or drag queen performing and its really fun. most of the stuff to do revolves around your friends and making plans with them, but theres always something to do, so it doesnt become too stale.

3) cannot answer for science/music personally but my friends in those fields are finding them generally pretty good!

4) the first two weeks or so of moving in we had a massive heatwave that was so so insufferable. I’m from socal and even I was overwhelmed. the weather also gets so frigid sometimes you feel the cold in your bones. so, prepare for hot hot hot (90+°) and COLD (≈30°)

5) make sure you do research on what college you want to apply to (within ucsc) before picking it as your top choice. I know a lot of people that randomly chose one of the 10 colleges and aren’t very happy there. as a porter affiliate, I can really only speak for porter, but I find porter to be remarkably beautiful and welcoming. with the koi pond, frequent nearby events, 2 dining halls super close by, and porter market all within a 5 minute walk from my dorm I never feel like I’ve got nowhere to go. personal addition- I love porter market’s coffee. porter is near sewers tho so you will def smell it some days. its also the artsy college, so like everyone here is gay lol.

6) very very safe. I frequently walk back to my dorm at porter from cowell (other side of campus, 20ish min walk) at 12-2am and have never felt unsafe. as long as you stay generally vigilant you won’t really run into any issues. I have heard of a few guys pushing themselves into girls rooms/getting girls drunk to try and.. you know. but as far as I know, other people have stepped in and prevented anything super serious from happening, so the community here does look out for each other.

7) ahh, the dorms. they’re available your first year, and then 2nd-4th is a raffle. but honestly, they’re a 50/50 on whether they suck really bad or not. we had the laundry room catch fire, a flood on my floor, half the bathrooms in the building all out of service, etc. mind you, its only been a single quarter. I’d say its a really good experience for making friends; leaving your door open on welcome week genuinely creates so many openings for friends. people will just walk in and hang out, they’ve got nothing better to do. I like the dorms, I like my roommates, and I would def do it again if I could, but that doesn’t erase the obvious issues that they have. I wish the school put some of my (very expensive out of state) tuition towards fixing them up but oh well. 

I’m not sure how informative this will be for you, or if its just a giant mess of words, but if you’re not looking for a party school but also not looking for something insanely study focused (though it can be if you want) this is a good choice for you.",4,1735197655.0,t3_1hlooji

2. honestly there is the catalyst a little concert venue and house shows but basically everything costs money. If you have a group of friends something is always possible it’s just definitely not the school that parties wednesday through sunday. we have like 2 maybe good days a week of real stuff to go to. Also if u don’t join a club good luck on going to anything without paying a fee of 10 bucks 
3. i was in chem 3a first q the chem teacher i had literally sucked but made it so you were able to pass but my 16a class they just opened up WAS AMAZING the professor is super smart and could be a good mentor 
4. tbh some students are ego filled but honestly you find everyone is all figuring it out. i hear the music department is great from my roomie
5. the weather is cold in the winter and rainy not too bad lowest 40 but that’s night time. it is pretty cloudy otherwise and the sun will pop out pretty occasionally it’s honestly perfect weather 63 rough average temp 
5. don’t choose porter if u want to feel clean 
6. honestly the way they do communal bathrooms it hasn’t been. the men here are also close to awful with exceptions depending honestly on ur college.

1hlooji,m4hehxw,skywalkerrdash,"hello!

  
1. Id say people are very friendly. there's ""clique"" (im using this term very loosely) as theres groups of people with niche interests. many people are very welcoming! ive met some good friends here at UCSC. obviously theres some bad apples but thats with every school/job/event ect. 

2. we have a big smoke out session on 4/20 but there is hardcore shows and local bands that play in downtown santa cruz or near soquel occasionally. there is many activities you can do in santa cruz besides drinking. we have a huge forest that you can explore with friends and find some pretty cool structures and art. 

3. the science department is actually really good in my opinion. some professors are hit or miss, but i overall had good experiences with them. theres many resources for science majors if needed. make sure to take those opportunities!

4. cant help here, i dont know much about the music department. you do have a cool looking building tho! 

5. the weather is typical beach weather. it doesnt get blazing hot and dry but it can get cold quick. just make sure to dress appropriately for weather changes like you would in any other city. it is advice as you are hiking to most of your classes you might want to wear appropriate clothing as you can get hot and sticky real quick. 

6. santa cruz gets expensive as many other states in this thread. there is many free markets in which you can go! you can also go to free produce markets if you like :)

7. campus is very much isolated from the rest of santa cruz. take that as you will 

8. 1st years get priority and automatic housing. most people after that have to rent or apply through the housing lottery system. i am personally living off campus and its not bad! i know some people are commuting from capitola and aptos which is a pain in the ass with the bus system. so if you are looking for housing in those areas be mindful on transportation and commuting!",1,1735537990.0,t3_1hlooji

1hd9jdp,m1waxx2,kyperion,"I’m in the opinion that this unintended gatekeeping.

One exam ends the entirety of your effort from over the quarter because of plagiarism concerns. Enter the workforce and you immediately notice that nobody actually requires the exact level of memorization that some faculty expect from undergraduate students.

If your concern is with students that submit others work as their own, I don’t think it’s your job to intentionally try and weed them out. Your job is to support students who are trying learn and understand the fundamentals of their field. The system will naturally push out cheaters as it is very evident to employers when a student is capable of approaching a problem in a productive manner. The policy does catch those who cheat, but you’re also affecting students who might have just had a bad day, don’t work well under exams, or misunderstood instructions on the exam itself. 

You might as well just make all of the course content optional and only use the final exam in determining a students grade at that point. The ones who will cheat won’t even use them; so why do you force it onto all of the other students who may not want to waste time on things that don’t get counted at the end of the quarter.",-5,1734114615.0,t3_1hd9jdp
1hd9jdp,m1wdbds,RedsonRising99,Disagree. Employers don't want to waste time and money with the hiring process then trying to train an employee just to fire them 6 months later. It's a waste of time and effort and puts the burden on the rest of the employees to pick up the slack.  It's the schools job to weed out the students that can't hack it (elementary and up). They need to stop passing it up the line for someone else to deal with. This participation trophy mentality needs to stop.,-5,1734115370.0,t1_m1waxx2
1hd9jdp,m1wdk6z,kyperion,"An employer should have caught this during the initial interviews and onboarding process. You’re telling me that after multiple interviews that are supposed to gauge how someone works on team and approaches problems, the companies still hire on the cheaters? Sounds like the issue is with the employer.

1hd9jdp,m1wi1m4,kyperion,"Academia isn’t pushing the issue onto businesses. It’s an issue everyone needs to account for. Look at any stem role right now and you’ll see that everyone is trying to automate the system; to the point that they’re not rooting out the bad prospectives from the good ones.

I don’t think it’s accurate to describe the entire education system as being bad. When it’s highly subjective and dependent on the person who is making use of said system. It has its problems, but forcing faculty to weed out cheaters which adds more work to their loads and strain onto their budgets will end up affecting others. This is a common complaint with CSE 150 Computer Networking where students are tested more on their photoshop/paint skills than actual computer networking.

I can't comment necessarily on the quality of the lectures as I already knew most of the material from coursework in highschool, but I don't think his lectures would have been particularly useful had I not known the material. The class was pretty test heavy, but that's normal for physics so I wasn't too annoyed about it. I was, however, annoyed that he chose to cancel the 2nd midterm and instead of coming up with some other way to grade it, instead chose to count your performance on certain sections of the final for it instead (I could go into detail why but that's a whole other thing). He also, just as an aside, essentially said that if you perform poorly in his class you'll be replaced by AI, which I'll let you form your own opinions on.

Regardless, if you have to take him anyways, you should judge him for yourself. He isn't a bad guy and I do think he wants to help students learn, even if I think he has some poor pedagogical ideas and isn't a very good educator.",1,1726274364.0,t1_lmz552i

Going to his office hours gets you a lot of goodwill with him, and is honestly super beneficial. He’s also just a really nice guy. He definitely wants you to walk away with a lot from his classes, is willing to do what it takes to get you there, and I personally feel like I did thanks to him.

I’d be shocked if that wasn’t a policy he had for all his classes though. I’d aim for higher than 75% for your own benefit, but he was really cool about that.

Most people have found their friends already and have solidified groups, so it’s hard to break into those groups. I want to make friends, but I can’t just insert myself into the group because they don’t have that shared need of finding friends. It’s not that they don’t want new friends either. They just don’t want to move fast and befriend just anybody. When you are a freshman everybody wants to find their people so it’s easier. You also go through the same new experiences together which creates bonds. It’s not like I don’t have friends either. I am friends with a couple transfers and I am really close with people in my hometown. However, I’ve noticed that those friends that are transfers are too and are ready to just go back home to them. My roommates have been here all four years and are so close. They go on roadtrips together and I can see that their friend group is very tight knit like the one I have back home. Those are the type of people you know for life, and they are the ones you’ll meet if you put yourself out there. Get involved on campus. Quit spending time in your room. It’s honestly easy to find people when you are around them all of the time (perks of living on campus). Find someone in one of your classes or dorms that you think “looks chill” and just say what’s up. Cool people will respond well and people who suck aren’t people you should worry about anyways.

It's a little easier in the sense to build the leadership qualities you might not have developed yet, along with the confidence in yourself to see that you have these qualities. If that makes sense. You might want to connect with the cc you are thinking of because from my understanding, it is free for two years yes, but you might have to be incoming as a completely new college student, meaning no college experience. I'm not certain though. Please double check on that, reach out to admissions and or financial aid of the school you are looking into, explain your situation. From my experience CC's are extremely welcoming and really show that. Not that uc's don't, but at the cc level they have a little more wiggle room and have this sense of community. If you don't qualify for the free 2 years maybe see if you could claim as an independent so you can qualify for the bog waiver. I think it's called something else, but that way you can at least get your tuition paid for, again, talk to the financial aid office at the school of choice. Also in order to talk with them or make an appointment you might need to be a registered student. Which is free, you just need to submit your application/registration applications online. Then you should be good after a 48hr (most cc) processing period. By switching to a cc you would be able to utilize more student resources, from my knowledge. Again, don't know what cc though. I could be wrong. But just maybe talk with a counselor about this. It's difficult here I know but maybe even chat with a professor you have connect with, a TA, someone who might be able to give you some insight as they might have gone through similar experiences or know someone who does. 

  
The biggest con, which isn't really a con is the application process. You already made it here once. Who knows maybe after some time at a cc if you go that route you pick a different school. :) Don't fear this process though, like I said you already made it here. :)
