The train is filled with really nice people, and if you're frequently on the same train take the time to talk to a few of them. You'll benefit from new friends, plus you'll have people who're looking out for each other.

TORRESMENDOZA, BRANDON

If anyone is interested he is in jail awaiting his next court date and has been deemed incompetent meaning he doesn't have the mental capacity to understand basic court procedures like pleading guilty not guilty or no contest. Because of this designation, his prior arrest, and his parole violation, he most likely will be in jail or prison indefinitely. The sentencing works differently with an incompetency plea. A time is not set based on the crime, it is set on when they are deemed competent, it can be much harder to be released once in the system. The random act of violence is going to really cause him a lot of issues.

That makes him a threat to be dealt with, but not necessarily evil, which seems to be your implication.

We can also feel sorry for their victims. It's not a competition.

1fuonut,lq6hfhq,Sigfig_49,"Amtrak has been underfunded for a long time. This is common knowledge and there is documentation that they have been warned about the dangers of understaffing. Their trains can ben run with 1 employee which saves them money. And this creates the conditions of unsafety for passengers. You do not need to show a ticket to board and Amtrak train. No one is assessing passengers upon entry to a train, and that is dangerous. This truly never should have happened to you. Amtrak was placing profits ahead of safety. And they knew what they were doing made things unsafe on their train. They have data on this. That is negligence. They are supposed to have employees walking up and down the train, assessing passenger behavior. You might know that since this happened to you, suddenly, Amtrak is now better staffing that train route. They were waiting for a tragedy to occur to be forced to do it. That is just irresponsible and wrong. And when you got hurt, you never should have had to find help. This just should not have happened to any person on a train ride. It is preventable with the right staffing and systems. It should never take the train that long to get someone medical help, as well. The area is highly populated, and getting a person to a hospital should not take that long. What is their safely plan? But the real issue is that they are letting any person ride the train without a ticket. They are understaffed. They knew this. They put profits over safety. A jury of your peers will not believe what you went through, a student just on their way home from classes. Amtrak created this problem for you and your family. Their response was so dangerous to you. I am so glad you are alive. I believe in you. It will take you time to recover and much medical and mental health support. It is a big setback for you. It was their neglegence and understaffing. You did nothing wrong and everything right to stay alive. The job of Capital Corridor staff is to walk up and down the aisles of the train and monitor the behavior, comings and goings, of passengers. They have been laying people off and I would guess that there was just one person running the entire train that night. One person. It is worth finding out. That is an unsafe situation. There will be documentation on this. Please take time with your family to contact and interview attorneys. An accident and injury attorney with a strong trial record who has your best interst at heart will understand why your case is so important to you and to society. Please do some research on how trains have been understaffed and how Amtrak and other companies have been warned about this. An attorney can depose train records and show that Amtrak understood the risk and didn't make things safer. When you speak to attorneys, ask them if they are aware of all this. That will help you make your case. What happened to you was preventable by Amtrak. I want you and your family to have the compensation you need. It is a case of negligence. You may not be strong enough now, so please ask your family for help. You can even contact the UC Davis School of Law to ask about attorneys in the area of injury and negligence law. It seems more than fair that you find a terrific attorney who can position you to have everything you need for your recovery and who will ensure this never happens to another person. Please rest and take care of yourself in every way. You seem really wonderful, and I am so very sorry this happened to you. But it is okay to get an attorney.

They were getting very abrasive and borderline violent. Would not take no for an answer. Getting very aggressive. I walked up to the girls and pretended to know them and they immediately joined the facade. Told them hey come sit with us so we can catch up. The guys looked very angry and annoyed. I made eye contact with each of them so they can see that somebody was paying attention. Anyway after we sat down I told the ladies that the safest place they could be on that train was with me and my girlfriend and I explained that I was carrying something on me and I knew how to use it very well. They all sighed with relief as they took seats behind me placing me in between them and the group of feral thugs. Who knows what would have or could have happened. At the time I was recovering from a very bad motorcycle accident so a physical altercation simply wasn't feasible. Point being, do whatever you have to do to ensure your safety!

We feel helpless and want to assert some sort of power over the situation. The anger comes from an empathetic place or love.

This shit still happened 10 years ago, and 20 years ago, and so on.  Kids/young adults will always push to get their way, right or wrong.  Your generation wasn't special in that regard and had just as much entitlement.  That ""entitlement"" was lauded in the couple years before COVID, when the students pressured the school into canceling classes two different years because of the awful air quality from the wildfires.  The ""entitlement"" y'all are criticizing now was celebrated during the pandemic, when students (and some professors) fought to get policies on grading, P/NP, late drops, testing, etc. updated as quickly as possible.

Call me crazy, but I'd rather not see that entitlement, misplaced or otherwise, disappear from future generations.  Even during those times, students made some crazy ass requests, but that energy is invaluable when true issues arise.

Not to mention that in this specific case, some students may have had flights booked for way longer than 2 months.  It's a concern that should've been brought up two months ago, yes, but possibly valid nonetheless.",-4,1733294314.0,t3_1h5qpzm

I am saying they should be taking the test on its intended date.

Now, I can address the entitlement piece you are talking about if you want - no one should be entitled, it is a bad trait. This is the definition of entitlement -¬†**a sense of deservingness or being owed a favor when little or nothing has been done to deserve special treatment.**

In what scenario do you find that sense of entitlement to be a good thing. Now you have also added that the entitled energy is invaluable when real issues arise, but you may be mistaken entitlement with ""fighting for what is right/a sense of justice"" or ""calling out issues when you see them,"" etc. Maybe you should go back to school given your lack of understanding of the definition of the words you are using.

You're also ignoring the full definition of entitlement to support your incomplete argument.  Entitlement also means **""having a right or legitimate claim to something""**.  Not every use of entitlement has a negative connotation, as you literally just proved with your last sentence: ""you are entitled to your opinion.""  [(Source 1)](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entitled), [(Source 2)](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entitlement)

That usage doesn't imply a bad trait bc yes, everyone *is* entitled to an opinion.  Doesn't make them right or wrong, it just is.  You're entitled to your rights under the US Constitution, the rights the school affords you as a student, and even to bodily autonomy (at least in this state).  Claiming entitlement is a bad trait in every circumstance shows that yes, you do in fact lack reading comprehension lmao

I already gave my examples.  Students knew that they were entitled to safe learning environments, proper accommodations, and grace in the face of a national emergency.  At no point did I say all of it was valid entitlement, I specifically said some was misplaced, but you can't have a true, legitimate entitlement without some people pushing for more or making outlandish requests.

Certainly would put the cops in an interesting position, given their evident lack of willingness to stop the encampment from violating the law, and negatively impacting people all around campus. Disappointed that they have been so submissive about this, no doubt with fears of 2011 Pepper spray v2.0 in the back of their mind.

And hypothetically, yeah, a scenario like what you proposed, with counter-protestors making a checkpoint around the encampment, or at the access points, would be pretty interesting as well, because it would force the protestors to either, A. be the Pot Calling the Kettle Black, and resort to law enforcement stopping others from doing something exactly like what they‚Äôre doing.

1cngowz,l6w1539,Wall-E_Smalls,"You don‚Äôt have to lay down and take it. They‚Äôre just trying to be bullies, and use fear to coerce people into accepting their disruptions/disruptive presence, and complying with their ‚Äúrules‚Äù or ‚Äúvetting‚Äù process for gaining access to the public space they‚Äôre attempting to occupy. What they are doing is illegal. But this is California, so LE has their hands tied on taking swift and decisive action to force them out, let alone arrest those who are responsible for violating the law by inhibiting the public‚Äôs constitutional rights, and more. However, I can guarantee you don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúlay down and take it‚Äù, if you‚Äôre brave enough to challenge them on this, and metaphorically try speaking truth to power. If you make an issue of it, you will ultimately be backed up by the silent majority that is sick of the protestor‚Äôs BS, as well as the authorities, which is the key, for they have a monopoly on use of physical force‚Äîthe backbone of human society, and which is the **only** *real* way we can make other people do what we want. Tried and true, after hundreds of thousands of years of effective usage. However, FWIW, I believe that the authorities would only support you in this situation because them leaving you high and dry would be *even worse* for their/UCD admin‚Äôs image‚Ä¶ Sadly, this administration‚Äôs has proven over the years that *optics* are one of the primary motivators, in each and every decision they make. That is why the encampment exists in the first place: they decided the optics of letting an encampment form is better than risking the odds of another ‚ÄúPepper spray incident‚Äù (an absolute PR nightmare for them), and are banking on the movement fizzling out, especially with summer break sooo close. 

But if you wanna stop laying down and start demanding accountability from UCD and lawful/prosocial behavior from the protestors, here‚Äôs what you could do, on your own, with no resources whatever (filming the encounter and/or having a buddy film it from afar would be advisable though):

Go to the checkpoint and try to pass through *without acknowledging or speaking a word* to those standing by it. You have a right to movement/travel in public spaces. The protester-guards will have to do one of three things: 

- A. They will either accept you right to move freely and allow you to enter (without even necessarily communicating with them) 

- B. Warn you you may not enter, without fulfilling whatever type of silly requirements they probably have in their self-stated ‚Äúvetting‚Äù procedure (which you of course have no legal obligation to give the time of day to). It may be a bluff, or they may intend on actually backing up their warning. In either case, you have a solution.

- C. They will use physical force to block you from moving past the checkpoint, or attempt to physically remove you, which would more than qualify as assault &amp; battery. In this case, you have a **major** solution,

In all except option A., you can and should phone the police and report everything that happened, detailed &amp; truthfully. 
If B. Happens, and you are barred from entering, you are entitled to have the cops come to investigate and confront whoever is making this claim‚Äîwhich violates your constitutional rights‚Äîand presumably planning on escalating things if you peacefully choose to ignore their warning. 
If C. happens, the police are obligated to arrest and allow you to charge the person(s) you were battered by (make sure you have video evidence, to make sure they can‚Äôt weasel their way out of it). It may be a PITA to follow through with the lawsuit (although I‚Äôve heard some enjoy it), but you are in for a potentially very financially beneficial lawsuit (depending on the severity). If it‚Äôs an obvious slam-dunk case and you didn‚Äôt do anything stupid to get yourself in trouble during the altercation, it will be easy to find a lawyer that will agree to take their payment as a chunk of the money you win (and only if you win‚Äîcosting you effectively no money out of pocket) On top of the personal benefits, will have set a precedent that would have all sorts of negative implications for the state of the encampment, including but not limited to decreased morale, decreased standing in regard to public opinion of them &amp; the overall movement, making people aware that they are a paper tiger, and have no real power to stop others from entering the place without being ‚Äúvetted‚Äù unless they want to get arrested (LOL), and more resentment and willpower on the part of the admin, to shut it down before another incident occurs.

To conclude, there is no mandate nor expectation that people law down and take the disruptions and their rights actively being violated. The simple answer is: **It just so happens that no one has been brave enough to challenge these bullies** and put them in a situation where they have to choose whether to drop the ‚Äú*badass rebel*‚Äù fa√ßade, or (foolishly) try to back it up, and get themselves into some very expensive, very time consuming, very **real** (as in: potentially becoming a felon and/or having some really nasty stuff on their criminal record), overall very painful trouble that could possibly follow them for the rest of their life, and certainly ruin their whole year (at best lol).",1,1717408900.0,t1_l3a92hh

1d2uxvr,l64zwjf,[deleted],"I mean, if thousands of dead children and repeated ""oopsie"" bombings of unarmed civilians/aid workers/hospitals didn't move the needle, were you ever going to support palestine?

Support what you want but let's be serious. You wouldn't tolerate one dead kid from your family without wanting retribution. You probably wouldn't accept a random child in your town being killed so the police could get a criminal hiding behind them. But thousands of children torn to pieces, shot in cold blood, starved... and you can't do anything about it so it's rude to bother you with it. Can we agree that you're not owning just how stone-hearted that is? 

You wouldn't let a 6 yr old girl be shot because of something her dad did. Why can a pile of kids be blown to pieces because one group of racist assholes keeps fighting with another group of racist assholes?

And any time I point this out, people are quick to reply about how hamas murdered and raped and kidnapped people at a festival to start this pogrom and it's like, yeah, that's because they are BAD GUYS. So when the idf turns around and does the same shit to random Palestinians, what does that make them? This seems to short peoples brains out. Why is it so hard to hold an ally to the same standards we judge other groups by? 

I think it can be hard to admit when we just don't care about something. We make up all these reasons why it's okay not to care or why we shouldn't care. But in the end, it's a choice we make between living for ourselves or living for others. And don't get me wrong, I'm a supporter of living for yourself. If caring about foreign kids being torn apart by shrapnel cramps your style, then put it out of your head. But don't give me some bullshit about how everyone in palestine has to suffer because hamas exists. They're literally funded by likud. The whole conflict is performative at this point. Israel is choking the life out of palestine while screaming ""stop resisting"". It's not too surprising that some people have a problem with this. It's not too surprising that most don't. But for goodness sake, let's not indulge in mendacity regarding motivations. The powers that be do enough bald-faced lying without us nobodies adopting the habit.

You know your team, you've got your face paint and foam finger, cheer them on while they murder those brown kids. Your team isn't Israel, btw. It's just ""some kids don't deserve compassion"".

Do you seriously expect EVERYONE to have maximal levels of empathy? So much so that they completely drop their entire life to mourn every horrific thing occurring in the world? 

We live on a massive, MASSIVE planet. Technology and the media have allowed us to be connected to the other side of the globe more than ever before, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that we‚Äôre all simply humans. Before modern society developed, a person living in North America wouldn‚Äôt have a clue about a horrible atrocity committed by some random person in Asia. That is, if they even knew that Asia existed! 

I hate to be the one to break it to you, but the world kinda sucks. Humans really suck. You could spend your entire life researching conflicts between humans and still barely scratch the surface. Please take some time to acknowledge that issues like the Israel-Hamas war (and virtually all topics worth talking about) are BEYOND complex. Guilting someone for not having a good understanding of them is total bullshit and not at all a good way to initiate productive discussion. 

Everyone at UC Davis (and anywhere) has their own set of problems to deal with. It‚Äôs human nature for one‚Äôs own problems to take precedence, especially in places like UCD where one life management aspect slips and everything goes to hell. Rather than sulking in their privilege, wouldn‚Äôt it be better if these students were allowed to take their immunology midterm in peace, go on to become a healthcare provider, and then make an actual difference in the world? Being a UCD student is also a tremendous privilege in that it gives people the opportunity to actually do something extraordinary in this world. Should we expect people to throw that opportunity away whenever something shitty goes down somewhere else? And where do we draw the line? Should we start cancelling class every time Grandma Betty passes away? Perhaps she doesn‚Äôt matter so much cause she‚Äôs old. Maybe we can all cease our daily work school/activities the next time Russia invades an innocent nation and kills hundreds of thousands of their citizens? Or do they not matter because they don‚Äôt earn you as much social media credit? 

It‚Äôs okay to care about these things, and it‚Äôs more than okay (and completely normal) to be saddened by them. Wanting to make a change is an equally normal response. But most people can only take so much sad. And for those that have absolutely no control over a situation, maybe they don‚Äôt want to be sad about it all the time. 

I can assure you one thing, judging people and making comments like these will not help your cause. You‚Äôre getting WAY too caught up in the ‚Äúyou vs. me‚Äù mentality (which is also very much human nature).",7,1716972404.0,t1_l64rv8k

Bring your own.

That's your decision.

Whatever you would need for however long you stay, basic camping supplies. Stuff to stay warm at night if you choose to stay the night. Bring a mask and have extras.

&gt;Do we stay overnight?

You can, but the fenced in area stops accepting people past 9 pm.

&gt;Are our belongings safe if left alone inside a tent? (books and pillows)

There is no guarantee. I am not aware of anyone actively policing theft within the encampment. I'd keep valuables on yourself. I'm kind of paranoid myself, but I think books and pillows are low risk things to lose.

This wouldn't necessarily need to be a problem, but it seems like one to me. I started talking with some kids about the IDF's AI targeting system that generates virtually all of the Israeli Air Force's 300+ daily bombing targets (bombing occurs more or less 24 hours a day) and how it is almost certainly Nvidia and Mellanox that made and support those systems and that US military advisors, CIA, NSA, USAF are in there advising Israel and trying to learn and test these systems because the US wants to use the same technology to bomb other people. There have been many articles in major media about this system ""The Gospel"" in the NY Times, The Guardian, many others.¬† And other articles about Nvidia providing the hardware and consulting for Israel to make what I think was the second or third fastest AI super computer in late 2022.¬† The Gospel suspiciously came online just a few months after that. Nobody seemed to know anything about these things or that Nvidia is just an hour from here and is one of Nancy Pelosi's favorite call option bets (I don't imagine these people know what call options are either). The Gospel decides who lives and who dies.¬† It's really important if you really care about the bombing of Gaza.¬† This system selects the people to be bombed and figures out where they are and predicts where they are going to be.¬† And half the kids in that camp might possibly abandon the cause for a job at Nvidia. I said someone - or I - should make signs pointing out this important system that chooses who to kill and where to drop the bombs - and who's responsible for making and operating the system.¬† Somebody might want to organize a protest on Nvidia's headquarters lawn - not a camp, just an hour or two to get a few TV cameras there. So people would know. Two men in their 60s found this focus on three mechanism for Israeli target selection very unhelpful and said that I should leave and that they are in charge and get to decide who stays and who leaves.¬† I asked a few UC Davis students in the camp while I was talking to these elderly men if this was true and they said yes.¬† They said sorry, they don't know why what I said was a problem, but that those dudes were in charge and they couldn't question their decisions. I am extremely disturbed by the Israeli action in Gaza.¬† October 7 justified some retaliation against military targets, but what Israel did went way, way too far. It seems that what's going on here really is a giant smokescreen to make it look like there's an antiwar movement and that it successfully pressured the Biden administration to cut military aid to Israel.¬† That doesn't appear to be true at all notwithstanding Biden's pause of a few orders of really big bombs to Israel.¬† The US already sold Israel enough bombs to more or less bomb the whole Middle East into rubble and so pausing a few shipments of bombs for a few weeks or months isn't going to do anything - while simultaneously giving Israel $21 billion in military aid every year before this it was about $3 billion a year - much of it money they can use to buy bombs from anyplace they like.¬† And that $21 billion got authorized like yesterday.¬† And there are still certainly lethal US advisors stage managing aspects of Israeli target selection and bombing - US and UK, but probably mostly US. Anyhow, this reminds me of when my child was in middle school and the school had a student protest that was selected, authorized, organized and scheduled by the school administration and the police department and the students sort of had to go because class was canceled for this official protest.¬† I think it was over climate change, but I don't remember.¬† I do remember thinking it made the kids not much different than trained dogs. If you really care about something, you have to take the time to study it and learn about it.¬† If you want to stop a machine by throwing a wrench in the gears - at least try to - you have to take the time to study the machine, observe it, try to find its weaknesses.¬† These are college students, so they should be up to the task. For the roughly 1.5 hours I was in there, most of the activities consisted of people directing other people to move tents from one place to another, move art supplies from one place to another, etc.¬† Then there was a meal break - the food did look nutritious and delicious.¬† ¬†There's a big first aid station with quite a lot of supplies.¬† Yet all the students in there have the UC health plan, student loan and/or parent money, and a CVS and Walgreens walking distance.¬† The National Guard is not going to set up a perimeter, cut off the ""camp"" from the local hospital and then start bombing it a la Fallouja (which was very much like what's going on in Gaza and which college students really didn't have a problem with because their elderly protest bosses didn't tell them to be concerned about this).¬† I can more or less guarantee there will be no US air strikes on the camp at UC Davis.¬† The medical station would have surprised even Jean Baudrillard as excessive for a simulation. To me, it had the feel of a simulation, like it was supposed to be Gaza under siege.¬† And the students dressed as Palestinians will remember their persecution (though I didn't see any persecuting going on) and probably go on to get jobs at Nvidia or Raytheon, etc. and remember this as virtually the same thing as having been on that bridge in Selma with Dr. Martin Luther King. If this is really about Gaza, you'd think the objective would be to stop the bombing and so to encourage open discussion about the mechanisms for accomplishing the bombing and whether it is possible to get to any of them, influence any of them.¬† All these kids have cell phones and stare at them often.¬† They could become experts overnight at the military equipment supply chains, the companies providing the weapons, the folks making a lot of money off of this.¬† They could figure out that lots of these companies and people are a short drive from here - worth¬†at least a day trip for a small group. Students used to be free.¬† Sometimes they'd get it right, sometimes they'd get it wrong.¬† But it was their show. This wasn't like that at all.¬† It had the hierarchical structure of a corporate cubicle job and the same unquestioning deference to bosses that nobody was even curious to ask how and why they were in charge. The kids were great and they did genuinely care about this.¬† But of those whom I talked about things with, none cared enough to have read up on it so as to be informed.¬† And obviously, the major media has an interest in not reporting certain critical details that involve powerful companies that spend powerfully on advertising, nor to really piss off the US government. I would probably find this depressing if it wasn't so interesting as a cultural and political phenomenon.¬† It's another example of postmodernity's impressive ability to absorb dissent, reconstruct it as a completely defanged and unthreatening consumer or lifestyle product that preempts real, human-driven action.",1,1715330917.0,t3_1cm08vu

Why do you want to inconvenience them? How do you expect people to take you and your message seriously if you try to get the conversation going by pissing people off?

Graffiti can be done in a way that is impactful. It is done all over the world and changes minds. But it can also hurt your cause. Look at the climate change activists who go and vandalize art in museums right. Sure, they stand for something that (imo) is good. However, just because they believe in something that is good doesn‚Äôt mean it justifies anything they could possibly do to achieve their goals, and their actions have actively hurt the global perception of their movement.

And to add to this, having compassion for the families of the Oct 7 hostages or acknowledging the SA that occurred during the attack will get you labeled as a Zionist extremist. Having Israeli friends or colleagues will have you labeled the same. Prior to Oct 7, I drank the kool-aid that academia cared about becoming multicultural spaces and actually improving. All this about ""intent vs impact,"" bystander intervention, and microaggressions apparently didn't mean anything, as I see calls for physical violence dismissed and brushed under the rug (both by universities and media outlets). 

If this specific video and instance is found to be a fake, someone please tag me or respond, so I can regain a glimmer of faith in academia and its humanity. However, all signs tragically point to it being real, and I'm not questioning its validity. And don't even get me started on the abuse of power of the UAW.",4,1718298561.0,t3_1de01ur

Although, he was indecent in his request, there was no crime or foul play in this scenario. I‚Äôm certain there was a level of discomfort in being surprised with a request to perform a sexual favor, but it could have easily gone the other way, if there was interest in the request. There‚Äôs no way of knowing without asking. Humans have a biological desire to have sex and procreate. This is hereditary and will not soon change. Society creates the rules around what people say and do in public, otherwise people would do and say whatever they want. I think this is on the border of what is socially acceptable, and can go either way, depending on who you ask.

Now I know it‚Äôs a stretch, since Israel‚Äôs government has been occupying and ‚Äúannexing‚Äù (my dictionary says annexing means stealing) Palestinian territory for the last 76 years, but it‚Äôs pretty clear that the goal of ‚Äúgetting rid of Hamas‚Äù might actually help provide cover for Israel‚Äôs more obvious goals of land theft, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. It‚Äôs also pretty clear that Israel is doing everything possible to ensure the Palestinians continue to resist violent occupation for at least another generation, which is quite odd, since, you know, Israel only wants to defeat Hamas. 

What‚Äôs interesting to me is that the word genocide itself was coined by a Jewish scholar in the 1940s. He created the official definition at the same time. He wanted to give weight and credence to the horrors that occurred during the holocaust. 

There‚Äôs no confusion and there‚Äôs no question about what a genocide is. But suddenly Zionists are tying themselves in knots trying to justify and twist their own actions and the definition of genocide to ensure the two never overlap. But an innocent party, when confronted with evidence of possible wrongdoing, would take measures to ensure their innocence, such as the protection of women and children, or allowing necessary food and humanitarian aid, or at least allowing basic hospital supplies. A guilty party, on the other hand, when caught, typically takes measures to hide or deny his actions, which is exactly what Israel has been doing and is still doing.

1dcot9i,l84aq86,Sea_Magazine_5321,"&gt;Yes, you see, I have had the gift of hearing and eyesight for the last several months. This has allowed me to glance at or listen to the news, on occasion. 

You glanced at ""the news""? Thats how you determined there was a genocide?

&gt;Now, by being capable of simple math, I was able to deduce that 15,000 children killed by one side after the other side killed fewer than 1,500 adults is a disproportionate response. Why would an entire generation of children need to be wiped out, hmm? 

Simple math of 15,000 divided by 2,000,000 equals .75%

Youre saying *less than 1% of the population has been killed*

But thats a genocide?

Because hamas only *killed 1500 civilians, in a single attack?*

&gt;Further, using my same glorious senses plus the feeble brain power I possess, I was struck by the thought that destroying 80% of all infrastructure, 75% of homes, deliberately displacing TWO MILLION people, and deliberate starvation of an entire population is not going to help Israel ‚Äúdefend‚Äù itself. 

Did the oct 7 attacks help the palestinian people?

&gt; Forcing the few medical professionals left to perform THOUSANDS of amputations on children without any anesthetic is not something that can be blamed on Hamas. It has nothing to do with Israel ‚Äúdefending itself.‚Äù

The government of palestine has zero responsibility for THOUSANDS of amputations?

Was hamas ""defending itself""?

&gt;Now I know it‚Äôs a stretch, since Israel‚Äôs government has been occupying and ‚Äúannexing‚Äù (my dictionary says annexing means stealing)

Uh huh. Well i reject your made up definition and insert my own

&gt; Palestinian territory for the last 76 years, but it‚Äôs pretty clear that the goal of ‚Äúgetting rid of Hamas‚Äù might actually help provide cover for Israel‚Äôs more obvious goals of land theft, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. 

Why dont you use your eyes to read hamas' charter?

Clearly talks about taking land, ethnic cleansing, and genocide

&gt;It‚Äôs also pretty clear that Israel is doing everything possible to ensure the Palestinians continue to resist violent occupation for at least another generation, which is quite odd, since, you know, Israel only wants to defeat Hamas. 

Yes, very odd considering oct 7 was only half a year ago.

&gt;What‚Äôs interesting to me is that the word genocide itself was coined by a Jewish scholar in the 1940s. He created the official definition at the same time. He wanted to give weight and credence to the horrors that occurred during the holocaust. 

A jewish person invented a word, for the genocide they experience? Wow!

6,000,000 jews die during ww2 -""holocaust""

x,x15,000 palestinians die after oct7 attacks -""obviously a genocide""

&gt;There‚Äôs no confusion and there‚Äôs no question about what a genocide is. 

EXPLAIN HOW THERE IS A GENOCIDE

USE YOUR BRAIN TO SUPPORT YOUR CONCLUSION

should be simple, since theres no confusion or questions...

&gt;But suddenly Zionists are tying themselves in knots trying to justify and twist their own actions and the definition of genocide to ensure the two never overlap. 

Im sure you wont tie yourself in knot, explaining why you use the word ""genocide""

&gt;But an innocent party, when confronted with evidence of possible wrongdoing, would take measures to ensure their innocence, such as the protection of women and children, or allowing necessary food and humanitarian aid, or at least allowing basic hospital supplies. 

Youre right! What is the government of palestine doing, to protect civilians?

&gt;A guilty party, on the other hand, when caught, typically takes measures to hide or deny his actions, which is exactly what Israel has been doing and is still doing. 

You recognize that the government of palestine entered israel to rape, murder, kidnap civilians? That happened BEFORE the gaza war

&gt;Israel is committing genocide on the Palestinians, a population they occupy and control, in violation of international law and in violation of any moral sense of humanity. And Israel‚Äôs genocide must stop.

They made their bed. They have to sleep in it.

Now, not all are bad. When the Palestinians launched a Pogrom back in the 1930s, leading to British Authorities having to kill their own men from amongst the local population, a number of Palestinians hid their Jewish neighbors. 

Israel remembered that and protected them. Their descendants are now part of Israel, still proudly Muslim. But now Israeli. 

And WW2?

Why didn't the Palestinians didn't take advantage of the British preoccupation elsewhere?

They did. They formed the Arab Legion of the Waffen-SS after the British and Free French chased them out.

Those who didn't leave were the Nazi Spies that reported on the Allies.

After the war, guess what happened. The SS men returned and were the ones to fight the Jewish people in the region. What they couldn't do in the Second World War, what couldn't be finished, they would.

Israel won. Angelo-French support was not just support for a new nation and influence in the region. It was making Nazis pay. Making the ones responsible for mass murder and destruction pay in blood. A very patriotic cause for them.

The survivors would found the PLO and their descendants Hamas.

To be black and to support Hamas is to be a Good Ole Klan Boi.

To be Asian and support Hamas is like backing Imperial Japan during the rape of Nanking, their destruction of Manila, and other mass excess of violence.

Doesn't matter what your ethnicity is. Terrorism is Terrorism. And Hamas made specific claims to eventually attack Paris, Rome, and Vienna.

There's reason for those three cities and the fact they were listed in that order.

The first invasion of Europe by Islamic Jihadists. Target was Paris. They were defeated and turned back by the Franks.

Rome seems obvious. Even Paris. But the last of the Crusaders, based in Malta, defeated another Islamic invasion in the 1500s. They repelled the invasion force long enough from their fortresses for reinforcements to arrive and the Islamic invaders to tire out and lose much of their supplies plus the campaign weather.

Vienna hasn't been much in hundred years. But was previously the seat of the Habsburg Dynasty. And any Sabaton fan knows the tale of the Winged Hussars that came down the mountain.

But that was the second siege. The Habsburgs had repelled the Islamic invasion a couple of decades before. That's why the second time was so powerful until the Poles arrived.

Vienna ultimately was the high water mark for Islamic invasions of Europe.

Actually, the encampment is asking, at least on paper, for divestment from Israeli firms and protection for participants of the protest as these are all UC can realistically do;  The UC system has no power to stop the war.   However, it is true that 'ceasefire' is the implicit and immediate goal, as well as the spark.  

The end of 'occupation' is what the UN is calling for -- as it is deemed illegal --  not these protesters, although they do sympathize and support it based on some of the signs they put up.  And the so-called 2 state solution calls for setting the boundary back to the 1967 border (not 1948), which is the border set down after the 7 days war.   Here is the quote from Wikipedia:

&gt; The major points of contention include the specific boundaries of the two states (though most proposals are based on the 1967 lines) ...

The 1967 border is supported by virtually every country in the world -- including PLO +  Arabic countries, and majority elements of US elites.

I will counter info though because I think it changes between departments. This is in my experience (civil engineering) and undergrad: 99% of my professors were professors. Not PHD. They all did research and that also taught based around a lot of application around that and that helped me grasp material more and my employer has liked that I was taught that. HOWEVER going to a cc for low divs would not have changed that because a lot of this came down to upper divs and tbh I doubt it would‚Äôve changed my employers mind but they did really love the lab and technical aspect that I got at a research based school in comparison to other hires from lecture based schools

1gkbmo1,lvk2zq6,Western-Cover-9529,"Yes and no. Mainly because professors tech certain topics in civil engineering. For example a professor may only teach fluid mechanics as a low div and then graduate classes. There‚Äôs no in between and she‚Äôs our leading air professor (Oldroyd) (a whole subsection of civil and environmental engineering that is not super highlighted in the lastest curriculum ). So you wouldn‚Äôt get her and there‚Äôs other professors like that as well (for example Pe√±a (though no a prof I‚Äôm dying to have again) she teaches 140B and then mostly grad classes I think-so not a great example because that‚Äôs an upper div but I‚Äôm trying to only give examples I know for sure). 

So I think you‚Äôll get the same curriculum but tbh the labs are huge in civil engineering. Also you may miss out on research based info because certain professors only teach lower divisions/prerequists. I think you would also feel this in mechanical engineering because low divs like dynamics or something is more likely to be taken at a cc

Also if you are at all interested in research you mostly only get exposed to it because our professors always introduce their work and then offer to let people join their lab. It‚Äôs a hell of a lot harder if you have 0 experience with the prof  You can also skip topics in civil engineering (you only take so many disciplines) and having like a geotechnical professor teach a low div I had made me take those classes later on and loved it but she didn‚Äôt teach and intermediary classes

TLDR: yes same info and go to a cc but for prerequisite classes you may not run into a professor who teaches research you may be interested in or get you excited about a topic you didn‚Äôt previously understand (me with geotech) or get labs that may reinforce your understanding of material.",8,1730829049.0,t1_lvk0rqs

But I think it's important to consider what you want to get out of your college experience. If you have a particular degree in mind, especially in a competitive STEM field, and you have a robust social life on your own and don't care to have the full undergraduate social experience, then yes, please consider community college. If you had academic accommodations or feel you would benefit from smaller class sizes and more hands-on learning compared to large lectures, consider CC. However, if you want to take advantage of joining clubs or Greek life, living on campus, internship/volunteer/employment opportunities, etc. etc. Then a 4 year would be a better option.

1gkbmo1,lvjxvak,geoben,"Also can confirm much of what you said. I went to Community college for 2 years and UC for 2 years after getting guaranteed transfer admission (needed like a 3.2 gpa). During the CC years I had a part time job that didnt pay much but I could do my homework when things were slow and so I saved enough to pay for the 2 years of UC and left DEBT FREE. The 2 years at UC were fantastic and I made tons of great friends I still have to this day and at no point did I feel like I missed out on anything, especially when I saw dorms or talked to people doing gen-ed classes. All of my classes at UC were degree related or electives since I got the other stuff out of the way at my CC. I left with the same exact degree that everyone who went to UC for 4 years got and employers see it the same as if I did 4 years. 100% recommend in 90% of cases (exceptions might be for sports or if you get a scholarship that makes it worth it I guess)

Also, if you don't immediately know what you want to major in, or even if you do since so many people change majors, the 2 years at CC helps a lot with figuring that out without having to do so much repeat work. 

And the GPA point is huge, I managed to end UC with a 3.9 because it was possible to ace the CC courses and then only do the courses that I was interested in at the UC. If you hate a class its hard to ace it.",9,1730827564.0,t3_1gkbmo1

There's definitely social benefits to moving away from home and whatnot (my home life wasn't great and going to Davis trying helped me open my eyes to it), BUT if you're going to insist on going then you NEED to be honest with yourself.

My job at this point is mostly picking up the pieces and supporting students who choose to go this route even though they are accepted to CSU or UCs. I also was a community college transfer to a UC if it matters. 

I would highly advise you not to do this with some HUGE WARNINGS: 

**(1) You are razor-focused and know what you want to do** or are already ahead on dual-enrollment courses. Only 2.5% of California Community College students transfer in 2 years or less. And that's discounting those who drop out. Don't believe me? Check the public database for your local community college - please note that they only report 3 or 4-year statistics for a reason. Not 2:  [http://srtk.cccco.edu/000/99index.htm](http://srtk.cccco.edu/000/99index.htm) 

*How to avoid this and what to do is a very long post, and my job is practically.*

(2)  **Apply and wait to see what awards you receive. To your dream colleges, UCs, CSUs, etc.** Wait for the awards, costs, scholarships, available grants, etc. Then make your decision. I've gone to (undergrad &amp; grad programs) and worked with students at all levels, and what I can tell you is. **Don't be lazy!** **Most use ""I'm going to CC and will save money"" as an excuse not to apply.** 

Privates- Tend to be more supportive, with higher graduation rates. You choose to fall off or don't buy into their programs - they will help you pivot 20 times if needed. The degree is nearly guaranteed for most (obviously not all). 

UCs - Large research universities. They are competitive, and your professors' primary goal *may* be their research. The pathways are clear, and with a strong peer group, upward pressure pushes you to success. There is a lot you have to ""figure out."" The students I have noted to struggle the most tend to be in complete isolation. As most do, you will be given clear paths to graduate on time. 

CSUs‚ÄîThere is less to ""figure out"" than at a UC. Your professors' primary goal is to teach. Similar criteria for success apply; however, you will find many more commuters with isolation that is easier to fall into‚Äîa natural trade-off. You will be given clear paths to graduate quickly; most take an extra year to get a degree. 

CCs- Your professor's primary goal is to teach. Your journey is on you. There are few forces toward what you want, with strict pathways to transfer that must be adhered to depending on your major, which, if not followed, will add time to transfer. Most take an extra 1 to 3 years to get a 4-year degree.  

The following two are FAFSA-related: 

(3) **If you are CalGrant eligible, you will likely go to a CSU for free with no gap** if you can commute. I've seen hundreds of FAFSA applications and awards where this is the case. It ends up being CHEAPER to go to a CSU than a community college. 

(4) **If you are CalGrant eligible, only let community college take what is needed,** **1-year MAX for engineering** majors and **2 years MAX for all other majors**, even if you have to spend 2-3 years at community college.

Most engineering transfers will take 3 years at their destination college, and you will have an additional 2-years for all other majors. The award at a community college is \~$1,500, and the award at a CSU is \~$4-6,000, and at a UC, it's in the \~$10,000 range. You only get 4-years. Save them when college is cheap.

And it‚Äôs true that your prospective employer only looks for the degree, not where you got it from (in most cases). 
I will add this: cc‚Äôs have great two year programs that get students out and employed in 18-24 months, making more than most grads from uni (earning potentials may be higher for uni grad, but there is also increased debt to go along with that). Even if a student just wanted to got through a program to be employed, they could move up with their employer by taking cc courses that they can pay cash for (or have their employer pay for).",2,1730840783.0,t3_1gkbmo1

1gkbmo1,lvld9h3,Vanzmelo,"CC is a great option if you don‚Äôt get into Davis (or whatever your dream school is) straight out of high school, if you need to or want to save money, or if you‚Äôre re-entering the education system due to work, military, or family responsibilities. 

That being said, choosing to go to CC instead of going straight to a 4-year has a lot of non-academic negatives.  As a transfer student, not only did it take me an extra year to transfer to Davis, thus not graduating with my peers and friends from high school, but the entire time at CC you have to be absolutely on it academically. 

It is soooooooo easy to slack off, fall through the cracks and become a ‚Äòlifer‚Äô, essentially ruining your chances of transferring to the school you want to. Anything less than perfect grades and you‚Äôll likely be screwed. I had a 3.8(?) GPA and I got rejected by UCB, and UCLA, waitlisted and then denied by Davis and only was able to transfer because my rejection appeal miraculously went through. 

On top of the constant stress of needing perfect grades, once you transfer, you‚Äôre two years behind in making friends, activities, internships, and the other experiences and things a four year offer. There is a bit of isolation that comes from being a transfer student. I never made those dorm friends, experienced late night dc runs with friends, or lower div life at Davis. There are many things I‚Äôll never be able to relate to or have experienced that my friends who got to Davis out of high school did. Yes, in the long run none of that matters and you‚Äôll still make great friends and memories but it‚Äôs still something that stays with you even once you‚Äôve graduated. (I did transfer to Davis in fall 2019 so that didn‚Äôt help my experience but I think I would have felt the same way had COVID never happened). 

Ultimately going to CC was the right choice for me because I got to go to Davis but it is not a black and white decision and telling people that going to a four year out of high school is a waste of time and money is not something I agree with.

1gkbmo1,lvkh8d0,NeoVelamir,"Wanted to give my 2 cents as a 31 year old who went to UCD for a summer quarter but grew up here (was fulltime at UCLA). If you plan on going into a professional and/or demanding field, undergrad will be the last four years of carefree relaxation you'll have. Life comes at you hard and fast once you enter the workforce. I always think back to how great my four years in undergrad were. 

I think a lot of the counterpoints you make are good, but wanted to add a little nuance to the law school/law aspect of it. Yes, GPA and LSAT are the major components and you can still network if you transfer in as a junior. But, if you have two students with near identical stats and one did 4 years at a UC and one did 2 years at a CC and 2 years at a UC, they will likely weigh the 4 years at UC grades more.

Yes, you can also network in your junior and senior years, but a lot of my friends at UCLA who went on to work as lawyers were met during my freshman and sophmore year and you tend to build stronger connections during those initial two years. 

I think you also make a great argument regarding the competition and student size at UCs, but if you want to go into medical school or law school, you shouldn't necessarily be trying to find the path of least resistance. Medical school and law school are very hard and the skills you learn to succeed and survive in a giant lecture hall of 100s students at  UC will be invaluable to succeeding in graduate school as well.

Having a big goal to work towards such as transfer will make you value your education more IMO.",1,1734694165.0,t3_1gkbmo1

1gkbmo1,lvk8v9j,jabogen,"I agree 100% with all your points.  Financially and academically, the community college is absolutely the way to go.

The only negative aspect for me was the social aspect.  I felt very bored and lonely when all my high school friends left town to go to 4 year schools.  And then when I finally did transfer, it took a long time to meet people and get integrated.  Eventually I made some of my best friends at Davis, but as a transfer student, you definitely miss out on a lot of the social benefits that freshmen have starting out. 

Despite that, I had a great time at Davis and recommend transferring from a community college.",1,1730830743.0,t3_1gkbmo1
1gkbmo1,lvkoebs,nhstaple,"For reference: BS Computer Science, Minors in Math and Music (2017-2021). Local community college (2015-2017.)

I went to Sacramento after high school because I couldn‚Äôt afford the prep process to attend UCD at the time; my mother served in the Army and I received her tuition benefits as an undergrad. Still, I could not afford the application process from hs to UCD. Also, if I didn‚Äôt have her benefits, I would have dropped out and transferred to Sac State by the end of my first year at Davis. I also had a roommate (Air Force veteran) that was in the physics BS program; he dropped out before his first year at UCD and finished an engineering degree at Sac State. He‚Äôs much happier now.

&gt; Happy to answer any questions for the kiddos and parents

I‚Äôm local to Yolo County, born, raised, elementary school, middle school, high school, the whole nine yards. The Davis area is my home.

I went through the CC system and earned my TAG spot at UCD. From my experience, and the anecdotes from my classmates, the quality of education at CC is far above that of UC. I cannot even express how much better the faculty at CC were at teaching vs the career researchers at a UC. CC and CSU are built to print diplomas; the UC system is self-governed and follows all the pitfalls of ‚Äúacademia.‚Äù If you‚Äôre from Mexico, this is similar to an ‚Äúautonomous university system‚Äù like UNAM.

* If you don‚Äôt come from a family of academics, engineers, scientists, etc. a GOOD community college will give you a much better foundation of your first 2 years (‚Äúlower div‚Äù at Davis; &lt; 100 level courses for every major.)

* In the Sacramento/Davis area, Sac City/sister colleges aren‚Äôt the worst. I‚Äôve heard good things about Sierra. But if you‚Äôre focused on STEM, WCC/Yuba aren‚Äôt the best choices.

Again, from personal experience as a transfer student, the students who did their first years in CS at UCD had poorer programming/softeng skills than transfers that came from a CC. This was my experience from 2015-2021. During my time at UCD, there was a trend of hiring more ‚Äúapplied‚Äù faculty in CS. I can‚Äôt comment much past that.",1,1730835244.0,t3_1gkbmo1

1clpj4g,l2wnjgc,[deleted],"Their list of demands is interesting. There are good ones on there, but what gets me are demands 2 and 3.

2. Total Academic and Cultural Boycott (Cancel Koret and Study Abroad)

3. Invest in Palestine, Arab American, and Ethnic Studies

This raises questions as they advocate for an academic and cultural boycott, yet they request UCD to invest in Arab American, Palestine, and Ethnic Studies. This prompts us to consider the implications of prioritizing one culture over others; if not, they have completely contradicted themselves in the presented demands. Additionally, Koret is an organization that supports Jewish life and culture. At its core, it is a cultural and religious-based organization. The only connection that they have to the conflict that I could find is that they support Israel's sovereignty. That's it. They haven't come out and said that they support the slaughter of innocent Gazans; they haven't said that they support the genocide. They only support the sentiment that Israel has a right to exist as an independent nation. So for SJP to call for the ""cancelation"" of Koret (a Jewish cultural and religious group) is hypocritical to say the least. In contrast, they simultaneously call for the expansion of Arab cultural studies, especially when they call for a Cultural boycott. They are essentially saying that we can't celebrate other cultures, only Arab ones.

Ultimately I do support SJP's cause (mostly), but these 2 demands make me think their leadership has some things twisted and are losing sight of what a peaceful resolution would include. It's not to minimize or abolish Jewish or Arab culture, it's to have both co-existing peacefully, but these demands don't reflect that.

The entire point of asking the UCs to divest from Israel is to, well, divest from Israel. This can commonly come in the form of divesting from communities and foundations that support the zionist state of Israel. Many Jewish communities are [anti-zionist](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-zionism-among-jews), so your claim of this demand being anti-Semitic does not make much sense. 

Let me know if you'd like clarification. Have a nice day :)",-5,1715034264.0,t1_l2w0qo6
1clpj4g,l2wgk9u,notyourgrandad,"If you want to have a boycott or divestment to achieve a specific goal. Then your demands in the divestment must be related to the goal. For example, when Apartheid South African universities did not let in black faculty, we boycotted them with the demand of integrating faculty. This was successful. The target was able to make the changes we demanded. We boycotted them, they changed policy.

When soda stream was using West Bank labor, there was a boycott demanding that they move their plant to Israel proper and not profit off of the occupation. This was successful. If we turn around and then continue to boycott Soda Stream as the BDS movement says we should, what is the goal? We are not punishing them for bad behavior, we are punishing them no matter what they do. It is not a principled boycott.

That's the problem here. The protest is not attempting to boycott with any specific goal other than to harm Israel and dissolve Israel as a country. Boycotting Israeli institutions only makes sense if those institutions can make the specific changes we are asking for. Boycotting Israeli academics is not only unsound as a protest but also counterproductive to peace as the academics are usually the left wing people who oppose Netanyahu and support peace. Those are the people you are harming and if anything you are pushing them to the right.

When you claim that any Jewish life or culture program or donor must be boycotted no matter what if they have any connection at all to Israel (where half of Jews live), it is not only clear that the protest is not principled but it is actively targeting a minority group on our campus based on their culture.

I am aware of the interplay between Zionism and Judaism and I am aware of the overlap and nonoverlap therein. It is irrelevant. If you take Jewish views and culture and sort them into groups that agree with you which are allowed, vs those you disagree with which are banned, you are a hateful person.

It also rings hollow to me that the protesters list respect for freedom of speech in their demands while simultaneously calling for the silencing of voices they disagree with who are Jewish and only tangentially related to Israel.

the ‚Äúoppression and occupation‚Äù i refer to the conditions created from the nakba, a campaign of ethnic cleansing where hundreds of thousands of palestinians were expelled from their homes to clear space for settlers, to an open-air prison in which israel has acted upon them with impunity, murdering men, women, and children, and committing crime after crime against humanity and international law, while subjugating the palestinians.

palestinians do not have freedom of movement, freedom of return, they do not have homes, they are violently acted upon by the occupying state without punishment, snd they are continuously denied human rights. the genocidal war of extermination going on right now is israels ongoing genocide of the palestinians under the guise of self defense.",11,1715036466.0,t1_l2wbt01

Protestors should want to garner support for Palestine, and clearly the avalanche of negative pushback against the protestors has done nothing to cease their worthless assault on students' wellbeing (as opposed to the administration!!!!), so the only way to actually make them stop is to demonstrate that their actions have consequences they actually care about.

Unless you have an alternative tactic? Can you name a single other method that can actually be done to convince protestors that abusing and harassing students (as opposed to the administration) is a bad tactic? 

Not to mention that plenty of people are already on Israel's side in all of this, especially those of Jewish ancestry. I'm pretty confidently pro-Palestine on this issue and even I'm not so delusionally tunnel-visioned so as to not realize that the topic is pretty controversial, and there are more than a significant portion of people who are pro-Israel to begin with, ignoring the protestor issue.

All of this to say that there's nothing ""insane"" about the pushback, and calling it ""making you uncomfortable"" or ""being rude"" is an unbelievably disingenuous (and to use your own terminology, ""vile"" and ""unempathetic"") way to describe somebody blaring a loudspeaker next to your ear screaming obscenities and accusing you of genocide whilst you are actively taking a final exam, something that for many students, they have spent $100,000+ of tuition and loans on, hundreds if not thousands of hours studying for, and upon which their academic career, future income, and in some cases, even their families' prospects for prosperity and their entire housing situation, is contingent on. 

How would you feel if your housing offer relied on your GPA being above a certain amount, being already bogged down by more than a hundred thousands of dollars in student loan debt, and having all of that being washed down the drain because you had one, or in some cases, multiple finals utterly disrupted and leading to your grades plummeting?

If it‚Äôs an attempted genocide, it‚Äôs a laughably poor attempt.

I also know a good bit about US occupation of Iraq. During Falluja 2.0, the operation phantom fury electric boogaloo, US told everyone there to leave within ~1 week (best recollection, was about 20 years ago). Civilians had no where to go. After that time expired, American Coalition rules of engagement were, if it moves, it is an unlawful combatant and kill it. Man, woman, child, or dog. 

Not all civilians had means of leaving. Men of fighting age, 15-50 were prevented from leaving. They wrote on their doors, ‚Äúwe are family,‚Äù hoping to avoid attacks by coalition forces. Sadly most didn‚Äôt matter.

We destroyed a shitload of buildings and damaged the vast majority, to my recollection. We even used white phosphorous and incendiary bombs in violation of numerous international laws and norms.

We used hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population. Again, in violation. 

We destroyed 60+ mosques. Again, in violation.

Out use of depleted uranium shells still causes congenital anomalies and birth defects, to this day.

In Falluja, coalition forces had 107 people killed. NGOs estimated between 4000 and 6000 Iraqi‚Äôs died, mostly civilians. 

I am not condoning American actions in Falluja, Iraq, or the war on terror. I‚Äôm just saying, the modern urban warfare I am sadly intimately familiar with, did all the same shit you‚Äôre talking about, and more. 

It doesn‚Äôt make it right, but I don‚Äôt know if any urban warfare can be done ‚Äúright.‚Äù I also don‚Äôt think the international rules or norms mean much, because for as much as USA hypocritically champions them, we ignored them when in actual war. 

Finally, I think your focus on children is kinda weird. It sounds like the anti porn folks, but think of the children. I personally knew several Americans who were murked by children with guns. Can we argue those kids who killed my friends were victims? Sure, all day long. Can we argue they were justified to try and kill Americans? Very likely.

Companies do need to be aware of the program to take advantage of it though. I think that's the larger issue.

Yes, this is nuanced and for violent offenses a different situation , but I‚Äôd like to point out that is the minority of the incarcerated population.",6,1715333536.0,t1_l3ehcop
1coejx8,l3gmaiu,Forsaken_Bid_6386,"Several of those points are not entirely accurate though. Only about 8% of incarcerated people are in private prisons. Less than 1% are employed through the PIECP program. It is a myth that the prison for profit system dominates the incarcerated population.

Moreover, 4 out of 5 prisoners are incarcerated for crimes that are NOT non-violent drug offenses. In other words, 80% of people who are incarcerated are in for offenses that most reasonable people would consider to be ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù of the moniker of ‚Äúcrime‚Äù: fraud, burglary, illegal weapon possession, DUI, theft, public order disturbance, sex crime, etc. In truth, the defining of a crime as violent or non-violent is problematic in itself, as different states have different terminologies regarding ‚Äúviolence.‚Äù However, if you look at state prisons, which comprise the majority of the prison population, almost 700,000 of that population of roughly 1,100,000 are in for ‚Äúviolent‚Äù crimes. Weapons crimes and burglary, which are bordering on violence, comprise an additional 120,000 of that population. Federally speaking, yes, drug offenses comprise the majority of that particular population - but the federal population is not the majority of the prison population.

Source on all of that: https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2024.html

I understand what you‚Äôre saying, but I think you should check your facts here. Keep in mind, I never specified that purely violent crimes are ‚Äúworthy‚Äù of a side-eye, as I would have a similar amount of apprehension regarding a fraudster, or a burglar, or a drug trafficker etc. Also trying to cite a reason for crime such as poverty or ‚Äúnecessity‚Äù is not not really great, because the psychology of crime is a very tenuous subject. If you have a source for that, I‚Äôd be happy to look at it, but I think just throwing out a statement like that is a bit much.",1,1715362658.0,t1_l3epgu6
1coejx8,l3hbqfr,spidermans-landlord,"https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/p22st.pdf

So, we still have about half of the prison population in here for non-violent offenses. Additionally, violent offenses is an aggregate‚Äî like you mentioned above‚Äî of a variety of offenses from closer to benign to not so. 

Additionally it depends if the statistics you‚Äôre looking at include those being held for immigration-related offenses (the stats we both cited did not comprehensively look at that).

In regards to poverty and crime, here are a series of sources talking about that in depth:

https://www.okjusticereform.org/blog/how-poverty-drives-violent-crime

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7820585/

https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00XGJN.pdf

https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1530&amp;context=parkplace


Its not poverty alone but a constellation of inequality and other intersectional influences that influence crime and types of crime. To me this is blatantly obvious lol. 

So regardless of what statistics we cite on types of crime‚Äî- is education not a universally positive thing in the amelioration of crime itself, or atleast a step in a good direction?

In 1948, the United Nations Genocide Convention defined genocide as any of five ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"".

Israel has attacked Palestinians using¬†collective punishment - conducting air strikes onto civilian populations including refugee camps, forcing displacement by destroying approx,. 70% of residential structures in the Gaza strip (which is ethnic cleansing), inflicting widespread famine, looting,  phsychological warfare, and not to mention rape and sexual violence. They are deliberately and systematically inflicting life threafening and un-livable conditions on a civilian population via military seige.

It is, without a doubt, technically genocide with the intent of removing Palestinians from the Gaza Strip under the guise of fighting Hamas. Hence the ICJ genocide case being brought.

Even if Hamas is dispersed within in the civilian population, which I will agree they are to some extent (although the Gaza strip has been occupied for 75 years, so I'm not sure where else they would be able to go), it doesn't justify the atrocities occurring on the civilian populace unless you think their lives are worth less than that of Israelis'.

The takeaway for you is that you don't need concentration camps and gas chambers for something to be a genocide, but you've done 0 research into this and are obviously not aware of what constitutes a genocide.

All that said, I'm not Jewish or Muslim and have no real skin in this game. I'm not out there protesting and I have Israeli friends, but at the end of the day I'm going to call a spade a spade.

Frankly, Hamas really only exists because of Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip to begin with.

People were horrified at Hamas's terrorist attack last October. The problem is that Israel's retaliation over the last 8 months has been so unbelievably far beyond what is justified, and so indiscriminate in their bombing, displacing and starving the civilian population. Half of which are under 18, just kids. Most weren't even born until after the last election in the Gaza strip (which, again, Israel directly helped Hamas gain control of the Gaza strip to divide Palestinians). Not to mention they have already been subjected to an apartied-esque occupation for the last 50 years by Israel, which leaves little sympathy left at this point. Those people were already suffering way before the ""war"" started.

It would be great to remove Hamas, but not at this cost. You don't destroy, starve and displace a populace of more than 2 million people and call it ""collateral damage"", all just to kill a few tens of thousands Hamas members. The IDF has killed 37,000 people to date with the vast majority civilians. Not even including those injured and  who've died or at risk of dying from starvation, dehydration and inhospitable conditions.

I'm just saying they were there before the modern state of Israel was created. Living somewhere 1000 years ago does not give you a claim to the land, that's asinine. Where do you draw the line.

Also, let's not pretend the Israeli government has ever wanted them there or has had no problem with them living there. That's just straight up untrue.

The iron dome is the reason why there are fewer Israeli deaths. If the dome did not exist, the rockets that Hamas and Lebanon throw at Israel every week would have cost many more lives, Muslim and Jewish. Another note, if Hamas militants didn't use human shields and wore uniforms instead of civvie clothes, Israel would have an easier time pinpointing enemies. If you take a look at Israel's military tactics, they send text messages, phone calls, and flyers out to civilians to get out of dodge because they are going to hit that area, since Hamas uses civilian buildings as encampments. 

You should also know that the US administration ordered Israel to stop doing precision strikes, meaning full on ground assault is the only viable tactic left, more lives lost as a result.

&gt;If this is not a Genocide, I struggle to see what is.

I recommend you look at the Holocaust, Armenian Genocide, Circassian genocide, Assyrian Genocide, and Greek Genocide. All of these list deaths from hundreds of thousands to millions. All mass killings. Don't forget the Communist genocides.

&gt;Those children are not Hamas, they are just children.

Not accurate. There are many children that are programmed young to be soldiers. This is extremely common in Africa and the Middle East.

However, dating back to as far as 2008, investigations by multiple human rights organizations have often found no evidence of this. In fact to the contrary, some destroyed hospitals that were described as secretly military have been expressly proven to be exclusively civilian. Now, this is not to say that I don‚Äôt think Hamas does this. I abhor them as an organization and certainly think that they do terrible things, including using human shields. But evidence has shown that Israel uses this excuse as a blanket statement to indiscriminately strike at civilian targets like hospitals and schools.

The burden is on Israel to ensure the lowest possible amount of civilian deaths. To give you perspective, in Ukraine since the war has began around ~600 children have died. In Gaza that number is 15,000. Yes these conflicts exist in vastly different environments with Gaza being an entirely urban area.

‚ÄúIf the iron dome did not exist‚Äù is not a valid argument. It does exist. It has existed for quite a long time. Israelis are not in the same hemisphere of danger as Palestinians. Israel is the overwhelmingly dominant power in this conflict. The burden is on them to mitigate civilian casualties in the same way the burden was on the US to mitigate civilian casualties in the Middle East. Compare the casualty numbers of civilians when the US fought in urban environments to when Israel fights in Urban environments. I do not know where you get this idea that their casualty numbers are acceptable, because they are not. All my research on other urban battles like Mariopul, Mosul, Marawi, and Fallujah has shown me drastically lower ratios for civilian to military deaths than is being seen in Gaza. I do not know where you got this idea that it is acceptable.

Hamas does not use child soldiers on a large scale, there are only very isolated incidents. Justifying 15,000 child deaths with a made up reason is wild. You tell me not to use emotions, you may want to tap into yours a little more.

Are you reading what you've said? You hate that they are using human shields, but hate how Israel attacks them? You do know that Israel informs civilians in the area that they are going to attack?

Its not a genocide. If it was, there would be a LOT more support by our countries' governments to go in and shut everything down. Not even the US government is willing to take a complete side on that.

Any liberal democratic American should agree Hamas must be removed , the debate should be about how to remove Hamas but that is even more complicated because I don‚Äôt think we really understand the military complexity of trying to remove Hamas from this densely urban area.

As an honors graduate from UC Davis who studied Judaism AT Davis and works with synagogues all over, I'd like to address your points. Zionism is about the Jewish right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland. While it's true that Palestinians also consider this land their home, many Zionists support peaceful coexistence and various forms of a two-state solution.

Your statement that ""Zionists (not all Jews) like you always conveniently leave out the fact that Palestinians live in that said homeland"" is antisemitic.

That's like saying I know all the history of Turkey because I studied Islam at university. Besides, for someone who claims to know the history you sure get some facts wrong. I've studied the history and followed the situation for years and so I think I have a good grasp of it.

&gt;¬†many Zionists support peaceful coexistence and various forms of a two-state solution.

Then please explain to me Israel's policies for the past few decades. Many zionists want peace and two state solution? Is that why Israel keeps building illegal settlements and checkpoints? Is that why they bulldoze palestinian homes and neighborhoods? Is that why they repeatedly assault worshippers praying at Al-Aqsa? Is that why Netanyahu said the best way to undermine a two-state solution is to suppport Hamas? Is that why they imprison palestinians without due cause or trail? Is that why Israel tortures, rapes, and mutilates imprisoned palestinians? Is that why Israel continues to deny most palestinians full rights or citizenship, consistently iterating that Israel is only for the Jews? Is that why that the majority of the Israel population statistically thinks the IDF should be using more force in Gaza rn? Is that why Israelis go on TikTok and mock palestinians in Gaza for being deprived of food and water? Is that why Israel consistently denies palestinians in diaspore the right of return? Is that why IDF record videos of them shooting and maiming palestinians, sometimes children, and laugh about it? Is that why Israel overtly commits war crimes and justifies them? All of that is for peace and a two-state solution? If you don't believe me on then you can look any of this up.

The jewish right to self-determination may be how zionism is taught within the Jewish community but to me and many others, everything I stated above is what zionism is in practice and these acts can't be ignored. I hope you can at least understand that.

&gt;Equating Zionism solely with colonialism is an oversimplification and ignores the diverse perspectives within the movement. This kind of rhetoric only fuels division.

The founders of Israel considered the zionist project a settler colony. Again, you can look this up. A lot of them knew they'd get resistance from the natives and didn't care. There may be diverse perspecitves on zionism but the most prominent ones I've seen at best are ones that would maintain Israel's apartheid policies or at worst, completely take the land for Jews and kick out the Palestinians and never let them return. Zionists do vary but many I've seen callously discard the rights and humanity of palestinians to such a ridiculous degree, it's disgusting. If there are perspectives you feel like I'm missing then please enlighten me. 

You reiterate that zionism is simply the Jewish right to self-determination but again, you ignore the importance of the fact that non-Jews were already living there. If the majority of the population in Palestine was non-Jewish, how would you have expected people to just be okay with a numeric minority getting half of the land allotted exclusively for them? How was it ever going to work? The right of Jews to their own ethnostate doesn't work if it comes at the expense of millions of human beings and their rights.

I also don't like generalizing groups of human beings, I know how that's like. You call me antisemitic but one of the reasons I and others villify the term ""zionist"" is to actively avoid being antisemitic by seperating the average Jew from the atrocities of Israel and people who support them. When I use the term ""zionist"", I'm specifically refering to anyone who still supports the state of Israel and its current policies. But given how entrenched zionism seems to be within the Jewish community, I can understand how condemning it could seem alarming and how the attempt at distinction could be considered flawed.",1,1718163542.0,t1_l87ptmv

Yes, many Zionists genuinely support peaceful coexistence and a two-state solution. The actions of the Israeli government and extremist elements don't represent all Zionists. 

Zionism at its core is about Jewish self-determination, not the oppression of Palestinians. Equating Zionism solely with colonialism is an ignorant oversimplification.

Claiming Zionism is inherently about building settlements or denying rights to Palestinians is a gross mischaracterization. Many Zionists advocate for peace, human rights, and coexistence. Nova Festival attendees, for instance. And me.

1cqu2e1,l3vuj5p,AnteaterToAggie,"To be fair, he's just trying to balance the budget. There's a $27.6 billion budget deficit because tax revenues didn't pan out as expected. The majority of California tax revenues comes from the richest 5% of the population and hefty portion of that comes from capital gains (which is taxed as regular income in California). When the markets do well and the rich get richer, California gets more tax revenue. When it stumbles, California's tax revenues fall. 

There's also some funny business going on with capital gains taxes right now. 

Normally, if Richie Rich bought 1,000 shares of ABC Corp. at $100 and sold them at $10,000, he would have to pay federal and state capital gains tax on the $9.9M profit before he could do anything with the cash which, in California, would likely mean the take-home is closer to $7.3M. He could then donate that $7.3M to a charity and get a tax break from it.

Today, it's all the rage to donate to a Donor-Advised Fund. Using a DAF, Richie Rich can donate an asset (1,000 shares of ABC Corp. while it's priced at $10,000) and get a tax break for 100% the current value ($10M), **paying *no* capital gains taxes before making the donation**.

We can easily double the population and help those in need.

1cqu2e1,l3z55yf,abcders,Ok so then why aren‚Äôt you telling Canada to take in tens of millions of migrants then? They‚Äôre just as big as the US with like 10% of the population. Mexico literally does the same thing as the US with their own southern border and other countries. Also how are you going to compare modern day US with 1934 Soviet Russia? Stalin was literally mass killing his opponents and they had massive famines that killed millions of people. Yes there were people dying in the streets. If you haven‚Äôt already personally offered up space in your place now for homeless people you need to take look in the mirror and stop lying to yourself about what you believe in,1,1715676901.0,t1_l3ylhnt
1cqu2e1,l417i2h,rekishi321,"Well Canada will be obligated to do so as well.  Mexico isn‚Äôt nearly as rich as America.  Since Bidens elected there have been about 10 million undocumented, a drop in the bucket.  We need to get that amount higher and come up with a viable plan to support them.  Raise taxes on the rich, stop frivolous spending on designer clothes vacations, and dorms.  Students should be obligated to cut costs, ie go to junior college go to state schools which are much cheaper and lack enrollment.  The Soviet 1934 model did all this, cut extravagance, it worked, but surely Stalin did overdo things with the land confiscation and famine in Ukraine, so things can be tweaked to prevent that. There was a lack of poverty and excess that existed there. So it was not all negative.  Basically the bourgeois billionaire class was eliminated in Soviet Russia and there was wealth redistribution and it worked to a certain extent. We can take the positives and eliminate the negatives.

Once we double our population with undocumented we will have no choice but to take this path, so as far as me housing the undocumented sure I will, these things wont be a matter of choice, since helping the less fortunate will be mandatory.  I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice a lot to alleviate the massive wealth gap that America has with South America, it will make all our lives less luxurious but to save millions of lives it will be worth it.",1,1715708630.0,t1_l3z55yf

The DMV requires you to then contact the California Highway Patrol to report the accident. In the State of California, wild turkeys are a protected animal by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and citizens require a permit to kill wild turkeys provided they are on private property.

Failing to report a collision with a protected animal, in this case, is comparable to a hit-and-run offense which is a felony in the State of California. This was all gathered from some brief Googling so take it with a grain of salt.

So running over a wild turkey on UC property on an e-scooter is a felony and possibly an additional federal offense considering some of the UC is federal land. 

But running over a wild turkey on an e-scooter on private property it is actively destroying along with a valid DFW permit is.. still a crime as the method of execution is bordering on animal abuse. Shooting the wild turkey with a gun after obtaining a gun and DFW permit is legal, however.

this individual claimed repeatedly that gay palestinians are killed by their government, in a way that is unique to palestine, as a way to deride and discredit queer activists who are protesting against the injustices faced by the palestinian people, not in support of homophobic cultural attitudes. by equating a comment lamenting the massacring of palestinian children and the destruction of all universities in gaza with ‚Äúsupporting people who literally kill people for being gay,‚Äù they suggest those massacres as justified in some way due to a claim made about their governments treatment of lgbtq+ people.

when asked repeatedly to support such a claim, this was the source they provided, an opinion piece by a right-wing author on a pay walled site that leans strongly right and and has been endorsed by the uk conservative party at every election since 1945.

https://www.removepaywall.com/https:/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/11/09/queers-for-palestine-must-have-a-death-wish

the article is an incredibly brief opinion piece that reads like a fox news article, deriding ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù and ‚Äúpurple-haired, post-gender activists‚Äù (a hilariously generic conservative boogeyman).

it cites a single killing, of a man named abu ahmed marhia. not only is this single killing hardly proof of regular and systemic killings of gay palestinians, but its also a gross misrepresentation of the incident: the author claims ‚ÄúHamas executed one of their own top dogs,‚Äù when there is no proof of that. firstly, he was killed in the west bank, where hamas is not the ruling body. secondly, an acquaintance of his was arrested as a suspect, and it was not a government sanctioned killing. unfortunately, this is not unique to palestine. this is the same way gay and trans people are murdered here in the united states, typically by acquaintances or people in their town. 

the article in no way proves that gay palestinians are regularly killed by their government. it cites a single murder, which was carried out in the same way gay and trans people are killed here in the us.

for additional reference, in gaza, same-sex activity is hypothetically punishable under a possible interpretation of the british mandate ordinance 1936, which has a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment (not death), however ‚ÄúThere is little evidence of the law being enforced, and it appears to be largely obsolete in practice.‚Äù

https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/palestine/

in the west bank, same sex activity was decriminalized in 1951.",12,1715688674.0,t1_l3z0ns2
1crbur3,l48ppx5,tesellate98,"just wanted to let you know, there‚Äôs actually a Wikipedia article about how being lgbtq+ is viewed in Palestine. While it‚Äôs not against the law, it is considered to be extremely taboo, and the government similarly does not protect those who are LGBTQ+ from being persecuted by those people.

So while it is true the government isn‚Äôt outwardly killing LGBTQ+ people, it is frowned upon by Palestinian society.

also, its not like being queer isnt frowned upon here as well in conservative/rural areas, and in those areas the government also notoriously fails to protect lgbtq+ individuals or prosecute those that assault or kill them. we have hundreds of anti-lgbtq+ bills being proposed or passed in legislation.

Aziz Salha is in the picture, this is him right he participated in the mutilation and murder. He goes to the window to show the rioting palestinian his bloody hands, and the erupted in cheers and celebration. He then threw the possibly still half what alive bodies out the window to the crowd, where the crowd beat and stomped the body into a unrecognizable mush.

It is possible for there to be a single state where the rights of all are guaranteed to be equal. The reason calls for a one state solution from Israel are inherently bad is because Israel is an apartheid state, and taking all of Palestine into Israel would require them to then live directly under the apartheid state, as well. The reason people believe calls for a one-state solution from Palestinians would be genocidal is because supporters of Israel throw out hypotheticals about how the Palestinians would be exactly the same (or worse) if the roles were reversed, a claim which often is rooted in bigotry. 

The usual retort to this hypothetical is that Palestinian leadership is anti-Semetic, however, that anti-semitism is rooted in the fact that they are subjugated by an apartheid state which claims to represent the will of the Jewish people. Additionally, Hamas was actually supported by the Israeli government in order to create a more radical political counterweight to secular Palestinian political parties. Many people believe that a two state solution will never be possible because it is against Israel's interests to allow a Palestinian state to exist peacefully.

Israel frequently admits to its fuck ups. Israel provides evidence for it's claims. Hamas does not admit it's fuckups. Hamas does not provide evidence.

&gt;My morals are based the actual reports from journalist and the few investigating as all the people protesting.

Okay, so you've seen the reports that Hamas fired from Rafah right? And the confirmation from Hamas that they did indeed launched a large missile attack at that time? You've also seen the satellite photos of the launch site (visible crater from Israel's bomb, visible discarded rocket launcher from Hamas), right?

&gt;Rafah was supposed the only safe place not a part of the war zones.

Which is what Hamas is firing from it and putting the civilians at risk.

It's clear that you are unwilling to accept the realities of war. People's lives have much more value to Israel than to Hamas. This is evident to anyone actually following this conflict and not just zeroing in on the horror porn. Israel tells people to leave dangerous areas. Hamas tells them to stay.

Your argument has to do with the density of light in an area acting as deterrence, but there's no good proof of this; if you're listing New York or other big cities (which are much more well lit) as an example, I can easily show you statistics of far larger amounts of crime in New York than in Davis. while darkness is an element, the crimes take place at night because most people are asleep and less people are there to observe the crime. you can see this principle on a smaller scale with shoplifting, where if nobody is in the store, someone will steal something.

also asking to light up the entire city and rural suburbs when the killings took place largely around the town square and the area where Karim got stabbed is overkill, not to mention something that probably wouldn't work on a sane individual already motivated to kill, the guy was a med student on drugs who failed his classes.

He was actually married and his wife cheated on him and left him for another man and she got full custody of their children and refused him access to their children despite him wanting to be an involved father.

He lost almost everything he had due to their split and never fully made a complete recovery as he‚Äôs homeless and somewhat down on his luck.

We‚Äôve had numerous conversations where he would break down Jewish history and culture and go into all the Hebrew and Greek root words to explain the context of the passages that are translated in English.

I think it's also worth pointing out that studies show that there is a clear correlation between wealth and protesting at college (i.e. the most student aid/loans you have, the less likely you are to protest, and the more you are able to pay out-of-pocket, the more likely you are to protest). Preliminary studies/surveys have shown this to be especially so for the pro-Palestinian protests. In other words, the majority of students protesting are significantly better-off than the average student and do not have any student loans/aid.

They believe that their message was more important than the time, mental well being, and money of every other student on campus.

But the second they have to give something up - their summer - they leave. The message is no longer as important as their mental well being, fun, and free time.

How dare they hinder everyone else's lives here at Davis under the pretense of ""this is more important and by hindering your lives we're making you understand that"" when they can't make sacrifices for this cause on their own.

That's not bravery. That's not something to be praised for. That's narcissism. These people are self-centered assholes who took it upon themselves to inconvenience others as a tactic but are unwilling to inconvenience themselves. This is not behavior to be praised.

Trump's stated position on that issue is to give Netanyahu a blank check and free reign. Palestine is about to be wiped off the map. 

Don't take my word for it. All we can do now is watch in horror as it happens before our eyes. 

&gt;  Families who are struggling to afford groceries due to inflation need that to change. 

Trump's economic plans will skyrocket inflation and absolutely tank our trade deficit. He wants to institute unilateral tariffs, i.e. the exact policies that kicked off the great recession a century ago. 

&gt;  People with kids remember that the dems continued to shut schools down in the name of Covid and have seen the long term effects of that on their children. 

Trump's disastrous Covid response and denial exacerbated the pandemic by orders of magnitude, compared to competent countries like Taiwan or New Zealand. We wouldn't have needed to shut down as much as we did if he hadn't ripped up the Obama's pandemic guidance. 

And yeah, I'm sure our kids are going to be much happier in schools after the Republicans gut education funding and proliferate more guns.

My older daughter is super resilient and bounced back fairly quickly, losing almost no progress once in class learning resumed, but my youngest has never recovered from it and the schools now are vilifying and publicly shaming her for it in the classroom. Her confidence disappeared as she slipped further and further from the rest of her class and  it's only made worse when we have teachers asking  her things like ""Are you dumb? How do you not get this"" (literal in class quote). No programs have been made available. The counselors are overburdened. The teachers are cruel. The administration is apathetic and complacent.

Not sure if her family would have to pay out of pocket, if so - we could fundraise. ALSO want to note that they did not confirm that they were officially ruling her COD a suicide yet + no official report has been published. 

"" (My name),

 

I received your email in regard to the cause of death for Megan Stanley. I have complete confidence in our forensic pathologists‚Äô ability to perform a thorough forensic autopsy and formulate a cause of death based on his findings coupled with those of the Davis Police Department. If you are inquiring about a second opinion, our office stands by the cause of death determined by our forensic pathologist. If family seeks another opinion, they are well within their rights to have a second autopsy performed. I hope this answers your questions.

 

Sincerely,

1emi6sw,lgzac6s,hotcheetomamii,"Megan Duncanson‚Äôs case is anything but brief, but to summarize, on July 9 she called the Davis Police Department whispering into the phone that her husband was going to kill her. upon arrival, police found her distraught and beaten to the point of bruising. Her family also says she could barely walk after the abuse she endured the days leading up to this phone call. Megan told the police that she had been with her now husband for seven years and the abuse had been ongoing, but had recently escalated. she told police that Harry had threatened to beat her to death within the past few days. Megan made it a point to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not safe here, i‚Äôm going to die here, especially now that i‚Äôve called you‚Äù that day, her husband, Harry Stanley was arrested on domestic violence charges. Megan was then served a protective order against Harry and remained living in their shared house. 

The timeline after July 9 is questionable because there isn‚Äôt any public access to police reports yet and different news sites claim different things. However, we do know that Harry was released sometime prior to his July 11 arraignment (which is against YOLO county policy) on bail of $30,000. it is unknown what day and time he was released, and his whereabouts prior to his appearance at his arraignment are currently unknown as well. his arraignment was held at 1:30 PM on July 11 where he was issued to follow the protective order and stay away from the victim. Davis police responded to a welfare check around 4:30 PM on July 11 at Megan‚Äôs residence from a friend claiming that they hadn‚Äôt heard from her. when police responded to the scene, Harry was standing outside of the house (violating the order) and when police questioned if he knew where Megan was, he said to check and see if she was working out in the backyard. police then found Megan Duncanson deceased and hanging in the backyard.

Megans friends and family say that she would not have killed herself, considering she had been saving money by selling her art, and had made future plans with friends. When taking circumstance into consideration, Megan had finally made the leap into asking for help from law enforcement, she was so close to freedom, why would she end her life? suicide as a cause of death in a domestic violence homicide cover up is not unheard of. ([info about domestic violence homicides being covered as sucicides](https://www.police1.com/investigations/articles/what-are-the-predictors-of-staged-suicide-scenes-in-domestic-violence-cases-19rxgrLOf8lZ3RUU/). 

since the corner declared her death a suicide last week, Harry Stanley‚Äôs lawyer is currently fighting to have him released, claiming there‚Äôs no reason to hold him. I attended the August 31st hearing where this was debated, and megan‚Äôs dad spoke in person reiterating that megan would not have killed herself and that he fears for the safety of megan‚Äôs friends, family, and witnesses to the case if Harry were to be released. Harry is a trained fighter and a nature survivalist, and the judge brought up these facts when discussing fear for the community if he is to be released.",139,1723055310.0,t1_lgz72wm

1d3qtul,l6hlxne,TheQuietMoments,"Idk where BLM came from in the discussion but technically they can assemble on the quad, which is why Gary May said they can‚Äôt remove the encampment, hence why I suggested the fire marshal idea. UCD also learned from that Pepper spray incident in 2011 where the students were told to leave the quad and disband their encampment by campus police and the protesters back then refused to do so. The school was later sued for $1 million dollars on the grounds of a first amendment violation of their rights to peacefully assemble on the quad which is why I say it depends on whether the quad land is public property as people have the constitutional right to peacefully assemble and express ideas, no matter how unpopular they are. In addition to the $1 million lawsuit that UCD lost, each student who was pepper sprayed were granted $30,000 and the officers who did the pepper spraying were also fired. Chancellor Katehi was later placed on leave by the UC President for using school funds to try to cover up that same exact incident before she decided to resign. I was a student at UCD when people were protesting against her and calling for her to be fired. So the current encampment is a very slippery legal slope that should be taken on a case by case basis. From a legal perspective, the university might not have grounds to remove the encampment in the quad vs if it were in the chancellor‚Äôs office for example.

1d3qtul,l6d4300,TheQuietMoments,"Brother or sister, you hit the nail on the head. I‚Äôm surprised to see someone here hitting upon this. China is definitely playing a major hand with the disillusionment of Americans when it comes to the younger generation. From shipping fentanyl precursors for below market cost to the port of Manzanillo in Mexico and helping the Sinaloa cartel synthesize it to be largely distributed to young people in America to straight up propaganda, division and Psy-ops through social media such as heavily pushing the transgender movement on platforms such as TikTok which is one of the largest divides in America right now I believe. For the illegal fentanyl trade, the Sinaloa cartel is making record drug profits not due to the price of the fentanyl itself but due to how cheap the production costs are due to the low prices China sets for them specifically. 

I also have no hatred toward transgender individuals personally but I do worry about the increasing division in America. So something that should be looked into is how two of the largest donors of the transgender movement in America are a Chinese-based millionaire and a billionaire. One happens to be sympathetic with and also allegedly has ties to the CCP, Roy Singham. He is also accused of spreading CCP propaganda to India as well. The other is Joseph Tsai, who is the chairman and co-founder of Alibaba which is basically the Chinese version of Amazon and it also has partial state ownership by the Chinese government from my understanding but I could be wrong about that point. The kicker is neither of them push for these issues in China as they do in America and I don‚Äôt think it is a coincidence. Everyone knows tensions are high between the U.S. and China and China doesn‚Äôt want a direct shooting war with the U.S. so how do they fight? Trojan warhorse the crap out of America.

BTW, a lot worse can happen than some stranger offending you with words. It seems like you're more acting like you think you're supposed to be offended than you actually are. 

I mean, Asians are literally held to higher standards just to get into colleges and high-tech jobs. Yet, you want to work a mob up against someone who probably has special needs and thought he was being funny. 

I'll give you a quick story. I have a special needs relative. Every time I take this person into a gas station or convenient store and there is an East Indian person behind the counter, my relative quotes the Simpsons, while using an East Indian accent and says ""Thank you come again."" Some random lady on her way out butted in and said it was offensive, and went and told the cashier and told him that he didn't have to serve us. Then she left. I went outside real quick and told her how offense she was for treating a special needs person so poorly. 

Point is, if context can change your opinion, then get the whole story before jumping to conclusions. Also, ask yourself if something is offensive only because it's about someone of a different race or ethnicity. Nobody cares when Americans make fun of the language or culture of Canadians or Europeans. I've been told that it was racist to call the Japanese ""japs"" or ""nips"" but it's fine to call the British ""Brits."" It's racist to call a Chinese man a Chinaman but okay to call an English man an Englishman. It's offensive to call an Asian person Chinese if they're not Chinese. It's understandable to call German/Deutch people Dutch though. Calling Koreans North or South Korean is rude, but confusing and conflating Ireland, North Ireland, Scotland. Wales, England, Britain, Great Britain, UK, British Aisles isn't an issue though.",-6,1728418623.0,t3_1fyr231

Yeah Asians are discriminated against and are required to achieve much higher scores to get accepted into schools.  So you‚Äôre saying they should also tolerate racism.  Makes total sense lol.

 No one has ever used Brit as a derogatory term.  But nip and Chink have been used against Asians in a derogatory manner throughout the history of the US. Just like the N word.

On your points, yes meat has become more of a symbol for its beige entity than the body of animal. One example is evident of how people get disgusted at fast food when nuggets or other other meat accidently still has remnant's of easily recognizable or undesirable animal body parts like feet, eyes, or cartilege. A large population of people would not eat meat if they slaughtered it next to them and then had to prepare it. I'd also reckon that the heuristic or mental shortcut a lot people have for meat like beef or chicken is of that beige neatly shaped entity and not that of the physical body of an animal with eyes, fur, ears. etc.. This is further evidence of the disassociation of meat and animal body.

Sure some hunting license money may go to conservation, that's not enough evidence for me to support it though this it fundamentally collides with my values. I'd still do away with it. Again my stance is animal rights like human rights so animals like a elk have a right to their life just like humans do. Thats self explanatory of my belief.

""Existence does not in of itself confer value beyond say my own pleasure and if it did there wouldn't be sweat shops in poor countries making our clothing. All life including human life has a value that is largely dependent on that lifes ability to impact other lives around it."" 

\-Again see comment history again we already went through this with paragraphs. You think that but others do not. I don't. I believe existence does confer value beyond my own pleasure. Literally, thats why I gave up meat and dairy against my own pleasure to find a different avenue of pleasure through vegan food (and I did indeed find it as my taste buds and mental got used to a new lifestyle). I liked the taste of meat of cheese but forgone my own pleasure in that area because I believed in the respect of animals existence. 

Just because horrible things and suffering happens elsewhere and one may participate in those systems it doesn't preclude them from striving to end suffering in other domains or offer evidence or justification that we must submit to defeatism and its okay to uphold suffering in other domains for our comfort/pleasure.",1,1730651475.0,t1_lv5esow

The good news for Ukraine is that they have generally had good Western support - although I believe we should be doing more for them. Also Russia and Ukraine and many many times bigger than Israel or Palestine. The scale difference just makes it not useful to compare. 

People here will say ""Well what about all the time before the October 7th attack?"" And that's a fair point. Ukraine also has history with Russia attacking and killing civilians before the full scale invasion. But they are such different situations that it is really not useful to make comparisons in my opinion. Also, the full scale invasion of Ukraine has been going on longer and the country is still very accessible to westerners and investigators so the casualty numbers and war crimes reports are much more reliable. The reports on Gaza are fare less reliable and constantly being amended by large amounts. Hopefully this gets better over time.

1cwo52q,l4xxe0c,Vivien_Ivy,"The protests and encampments internationally have indeed drawn attention and awareness to the genocide in Gaza, and calls for divestment demonstrate that students are recognizing the links between the colleges and the state funded genocide their investments support.
However, there is a need for wider swaths of students to see the political implications of their demands.


These colleges act as agents of imperialist war abroad, and work hand in hand with repressive forces at home, as we've seen with the police attacks that have taken place, and the attacks on striking UC UAW members by the union bureaucracy.


Many of the regents are also members of the Democratic party, and work alongside their ""colleagues on the right"", including outright fascists.¬†
They're calling the strike illegal, utilizing state police, and the labour police of the UAW bureaucracy (whom were responsible for selling out UC members with their '22 contract's no-strike clause) to prevent workers and students internationally from joining forces in a political struggle to end imperialist war.

If you'd rather have native vegetation there are strains of grass that could work for a lawn. Most CA grasses are bushy or tules, but some strains such as California Field Sedge would work well for the quad. The City of Davis Parks Department generally uses tall fescue for sports fields/parks/quads with short fescue around trees where there will be shade and it's harder to mow because fescue is a pretty standard grass for these purposes and relatively low maintenance. California Field Sedge grows taller, but can be mowed and requires less water/maintenance. It's also less likely to go dormant with drought, and would recover more quickly in the case of a student terrorist encampment preventing adequate lawn care.

We agree on the real issue. I'm glad to see the encampment gone, and I'm glad to see that the lawn should recover. These students disgraced my town, and they should face consequences. Unfortunately, I doubt they'll allow themselves to feel shame.

For recovery I'd suggest the landscapers aerate the affected sections, and charge the soil. Over seed in September if it's cool enough. I'd suggest the university make a law against blocking sections of grass so that it's lawns can be cared for as well.",13,1720081921.0,t1_lbkgitm

Israel takes defensive measures to protect its citizens from constant terrorist threats.

The assertion that Zionists are torturing people is completely false and unfounded. Zionism is about the self-determination and national liberation of the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland. There is no credible evidence to support your claims of Zionist torture.

Moreover, your faceless account claiming to be an anti-Zionist Jew is highly questionable. It's likely you are not Jewish at all.

Check Oxford, Quora, etc.

Regarding camping, I camp and perform at festivals. People sometimes use cups or buckets when bathrooms aren‚Äôt available and dump them out later. Unless you have a key to a building, like the psychology building, where else can you go? Walk over there at night or pee under a tree?

So, again, you‚Äôre literally just making up bullshit, and proceeding as if it is fact. Just like your profound misunderstanding of Zionism, which I can only assume means you haven‚Äôt bothered to do even the most basic research on the history of the Zionist project.

1du4hru,lbsc4fr,magicology,"
Actually, my observation is based on firsthand experience. The area did smell like urine, and it‚Äôs not uncommon for people to use buckets or cups when bathrooms are unavailable, especially at night. Were you present during these times? If so, where did you go to the bathroom? Unless you were there, dismissing these claims outright is premature.

Regarding Zionism, it‚Äôs important to understand the facts. Zionism is about the self-determination and national liberation of the Jewish people in their ancestral homeland. It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúfascism‚Äù or ‚Äúevil‚Äù but a movement for survival. 

How do you tell who is a Zionist Jew and who is an anti-Zionist just by looking at them or asking them? 

Pushing an antisemitic definition to label who is good or bad is misleading and harmful. 

Zionism is not Jewish supremacy; it‚Äôs about ensuring Jewish survival and sovereignty.

It's actually not a slippery slope at all. Just because YOU haven't educated yourself about the First Amendment implications of a public institution terminating someone's employment for their private speech does not mean that there is not clear legal precedent on the subject.

It doesn't matter how much you dislike this person. No matter how much you believe you are correct, they still have rights under the law to express their viewpoint (regardless of how repugnant you find it).",8,1719601528.0,t1_laoc0dk

There is minimal limitation on a public institution's ability to terminate an employee who violates their policy, creates an unsafe working environment for students/staff, and creates a negative public perception of their agency. Someone's ""private"" free speech protection on twitter does not extend to protection of their actions in person, on a campus, in the real world as an employee and representative of an organization, which have been repeatedly documented by police. Harassment of a protected class of students physically occurring on your campus is a fireable offense that is not protected by the first amendment. 

As many have already said, internal/legal reviews and ultimately the analysis of the cost/effectiveness of escalation from a lawsuit (regardless of how frivolous the terminated's claims would be) can take a long time. But they certainly are not waiting to fire her because they can't. Her personal views on whatever she wants to believe in her free time absolutely do not give her protection to harass, stalk and doxx students in violation of UC policy.",1,1731604682.0,t1_laq11ib

1d5g7i8,l6n4i2n,[deleted],"shows how myopic and bias your view is

The whole ""Israel has a right to exist"" argument really only works if you view stealing other peoples land based on some vague historical/ancestral claim to it and then committing apartheid, ethnic cleansing and genocide against the people living there as some neutral, benign action that everyone should accept.

And if were going by that logic, Palestinians and even some Lebanese and Syrians have more Mizrahi jewish blood in them than all those imported European parasites. Just like how Moroccans and Algerians speak an arabic with a Berber substrate because thats their ancestry, and the Egyptians have a coptic element in their Arabic slang, the arabic slang language itself spoken in Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine also has aramaic elements. The overwhelming amount of ignorance and people speaking out of pocket on this issue is bewildering. Do you guys really research anything before you talk about topics or is it just regurgitation of Zionist propaganda and islamophobia like the good goyim you are?

In 1923, 100 years ago, Ze'ev Jabotinsky wrote, The Iron Wall, and a follow up, The Ethics of The Iron Wall (sooo racist towards Africans), in which he fully acknowledged that post Balfour Zionsim was colonialism, and that, based on the entirety of history, the native Palestinian population would resist being colonized until the bitter end. He directly compared it to the colonization of North America. He promoted doing it anyway, claiming Zionist colonialism was a ""just"" colonialism (he also thought North American colonialists were good guys, so not a great judge of morality), not caring what that meant for the native population.

Ze'ev is important, because his Betar militant youth group helped found the Irgun terrorist group, along with other supporters of his, and the splinter Lehi terrorist group. The Irgun bombed numerous Palestinian markets and other public places, murdering many Palestinian civilians, including children, even including Palestinian Jews (who didn't support colonialist Zionsim).

The Irgun are important, because they ended up being led by future Likud PM, Menachem Begin, who bombed the King David Hotel. The King David Hotel was bombed because the British had raided the Jewish Agency and seized numerous documents that may have shown that the terrorists were working with the JA and Haganah (JA liked to pretend that they didn't support the terrorism). The British then stored those documents at their base, in the hotel. That the Irgun terrorists responded to a JA raid, itself seems to prove the connection. That the thousands of Irgun (and Lehi) terrorists were also quickly merged into the new nation's military (IDF) and intelligence (Mossad) agencies, and are still celebrated as ""heroes"" by Israelis, to this day, also seems to support total collaboration between the groups.

That other terrorist group mentioned, Lehi (also known as the Stern Gang), was considered even more extreme. They even tried to ally with the Nazis, against the British. Lehi ended up being led by Yitzhak Shamir, future Mossad agent, and another future Likud PM. They assassinated Lord Moyne, and others.

The two terrorist groups also operated outside of Palestine. The Irgun bombed the British Embassy at Porta Pia, in Rome. The Lehi bombed the British Colonial Club, in London. A timer failed in another bombing attempt, at the Colonial Office, in Whitehall. Two female Lehi operatives were arrested crossing from Belgium to France, with the ingredients for letter bombs. 21 letter bombs were found to be have sent, and were intercepted. They mined the Cairo-Haifa train, in Egypt, twice, killing dozens of civilians, as well as British soldiers.

In 1945, there was a major land and peoples survey done in Palestine. It showed that the Zionists only owned about 5% of the total land, 20% of the arable land, and owned a majority in zero districts. The partition was not only going to be forced on the native Palestinian majority, but Jews were still going to be a minority, in the part allocated to them. The only possible way to even become a ""Jewish state"" was going to require getting rid of the actual majority (at least enough so that there'd be a solid Jewish majority, so they could fake being democratic).

This is also shown by the 1948, post Nakba, population of Israel. If there was 716,700 Jews, 156,000+ non-Jews, and approximately 700k non-Jews ethnically cleansed, that means the Jewish population, in the Zionist portion of partition, was originally over 100,000 less than the non-Jewish population. To believe that there was never any intent, by Zionists, to ethnically cleanse away the Palestinian majority would require believing that they never intended to create a ""Jewish state"". It's a nonsensical notion.

Begin, and those terrorist groups, also opposed partition, but for the opposite reason Palestinians did. Palestinians didn't want to be colonized, at all. The terrorists wanted to colonize it all. ""Moderate"" Zionists were okay with colonizing half ... for now (what would happen in the future, after partition, was up to them, said Ben-Gurion). The Zionist terrorists were also involved in massacres, and assassinations, during the partition violence (colonialist war against the natives).

Another notable future Likud PM, also started in the military, during the partition fighting. That was Ariel Sharon, war criminal, ""Butcher of Beirut"".",-9,1717258298.0,t1_l6m8hbb

1d5g7i8,l6n4j95,[deleted],"Menachem Begin, and these other Zionist terrorists, are important because they became involved in Israeli politics, first forming Herut. That was the party that Albert Einstein, and other prominent American Jews, opposed, having a letter printed in the NYT, in December of 1948, when Begin came to visit the US. The letter opened ...

""Among the most disturbing political phenomena of our times is the emergence in the newly created state of Israel of the ""Freedom Party"" (Tnuat Haherut), a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy and social appeal to the Nazi and Fascist parties. It was formed out of the membership and following of the former Irgun Zvai Leumi, a terrorist, right-wing, chauvinist organization in Palestine.""

Herut merged with other extremist parties, over the years, and eventually became Likud, in the 70s. Now, people get upset over the slogan ""From the river to the sea!"", but it's the second part that's most important, ""Palestine will be free!"". Because ""Palestine"" isn't defined as an ethno-state, a free Palestine can be a single state, free for all to live in, and return to, free of continuing colonization, free of occupation, free of oppression, etc. Just like a Germany free of Nazism, an Italy free of fascism, a South Africa free of apartheid, or an America free of slavery from sea to shiny sea. It doesn't necessitate purging all the Jews. It just necessitates them giving up on the idea of an ethno-state.

On the other hand, because ""Israel"" has been defined as an ethno-state, Likud's, ""between the sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty"", has no possible good interpretation. It is a declaration of intent to completely colonize, and ethnically cleanse, all Palestine territories. Not only that, but it also claims that they have a ""right"" to all of the ""Land of Israel"" (biblical borders that don't mesh with archaeological reality), which is an open declaration of future wars, against Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and possibly even Iraq.

Likud platform ...

1977: ""The Right of the Jewish People to the Land of Israel (Eretz Israel)

a. The right of the Jewish people to the land of Israel is eternal and indisputable and is linked with the right to security and peace; therefore, Judea and Samaria will not be handed to any foreign administration; between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty.

b. A plan which relinquishes parts of western Eretz Israel, undermines our right to the country, unavoidably leads to the establishment of a ""Palestinian State,"" jeopardizes the security of the Jewish population, endangers the existence of the State of Israel. and frustrates any prospect of peace.""

1999: ""The Government of Israel flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river. The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign state. Thus, for example, in matters of foreign affairs, security, immigration, and ecology, their activity shall be limited in accordance with imperatives of Israel's existence, security and national needs.""

""The Jewish communities in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza are the realization of Zionist values. Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and constitutes an important asset in the defense of the vital interests of the State of Israel. The Likud will continue to strengthen and develop these communities and will prevent their uprooting.""

All Palestine territories are officially considered occupied, by the International Court of Justice, the UN GA, the UN SC, and even in official documents of Israel's own allies. Likud is still using the blueprint for colonizing North America, in the West Bank. Move settlements out into native territory, piss off the natives, the natives retaliate, cry about poor ""innocent"" colonizing settlers being the ""victims"" of violent ""Savages!"", call in the cavalry to put down the native uprising, and eventually expand the borders to include those settlements. Rinse and repeat. In Gaza, Israel is operating an open air WWII style fascist ghetto. Them claiming a ""right to defend themselves"" would be like the Nazis claiming a ""right to defend themselves "" from the Warsaw ghetto uprising. There's no ""war"". That they're the occupiers means the ""war"" part is long over. Those people are actually supposed to be under the occupier's protection.

That partition was forced upon the Palestinian majority, against their will ... that the Zionist portion still had to be forcefully ethnically cleansed of its non-Jewish majority, against their will ... that the millions of occupied Palestinians don't have a say in the government that truly rules over them,

This is a huge, huge assumption on your part. Why do you assume that somebody protesting something *actually* has an ulterior motive that they are *really* protesting for, rather than assume they just aren't going about organizing in the best way as inexperienced undergrads? 

The camp routinely tells the undergrads that they are not covered by the strike protections. You will still have to do your homework, your exams, etc. Maybe some people aren't around when that is communicated. Maybe some people lacking discipline decided to go against that which was communicated, thinking they know best for the strike. Maybe it *could* be one person trying to get out of their exams, but that is by no way a representation of the camp. Maybe it's because the camp is not giving the undergrads enough guidance. Maybe it's someone completely unrelated to the camp and trying to take advantage of the situation. Somebody filled one of the restroom toilets with cement *after* there was a big speech given about how *some* people need to stop lashing out to make themselves feel better, and think of the movement as a whole. Unfortunately, unless an organization is very well put together and disciplined, it's impossible to control and keep track of every individual.

&gt;you feel this school doesn't align with your views drop out or transfer.

Can you name a university with no investments in Israel? The point is to get invested universities to divest from Israel because it puts pressure on Israel to comply with international law. This same tactic was applied to South African Apartheid. If the regime has less financial support, it is made more expensive to run the repressive regime, and the point of any protest is to make it less expensive to give in to the demands of the protest than it is to allow the protest to go on.

&gt;You can't expect everyone to quit their job &amp; school to physically protest.

Why do you have to quit your job or school to physically protest? Do you think anyone who has protested something is unemployed? I think it's common sense that people need money to stay alive, and work doesn't take up 100% of your day/week.",-3,1717259769.0,t1_l6l58kh
1d5g7i8,l6nekk3,komorebi_97,"First things first bro I didn't say anything about what your camp is and isn't teaching. 

\*\*\*All I know is that you guys are only pushing one side of what's happening. imo both governments are wrong and the poor innocent civilians are getting dragged into this stupid land/political/religious fight. And this white savior complex and being trendy mindset in students is making them use the protest as something to do in their free time which should't be the reasoning behind joining the protest. 

Secondly it was a joke thats why I started the next paragraph by saying ""in all seriousness"". Regardless ur not in the class so you wouldn't know that the final is not optional.

Thirdly, I don't have enough free time to search schools who don't have investments in Israel. If you want a school that doesn't have the investments find it yourself. Perhaps a private school because public schools fall under the government. 

\*\*\*Also if your talking about hurting the school financially then look at my post again. I suggested dropping out of campus housing, meal plans, and insurance. When I was living on campus apartments it was approx 4,000, meal plan 2,000, UC SHIP 1,000 which totals to 7,000. If even 500 students stop the school would be getting 3.5M less. 

Lastly, yes the people who are protesting are acting like they are unemployed and have quit school. You the protestors aren't respecting the fact that others take their jobs and school seriously. Walking on students doing exams and calling them murderers and then encouraging students to drop finals, is pretty much encouraging students to quit school (not in clerical terms, but if you fail your classes you'll be on probation and if you cont. failing you'll be kicked out).

I'm so sorry that young scientists and scholars are acquiring the corporative structure of thinking, in my long 16 years as scientists I have seen slowly the transition. It really makes me sad to see that universality of knowledge, that it is the ultimate goal of an UNIVERSITY, has been reduced to prepare highly technically trained doctors (I believe the right term is doctor in biochemistry? the abbreviation for philosophiae doctor is technical denotation, but not an academic title). 

It has been proven multiple times that standardized tests are not a good evaluation tool for knowledge and, more relevant, for critical thinking. And every good academic will take that into consideration when grading the knowledge that they delivered. 

I'm so glad that the professor was able to correct the results of his class, that shows that they are aware of the weakness of their evaluation systems. I'm glad they recognize education as a process and not as a compendium of written knowledge. 

Dude, you will be surprised at how many brilliant scientists struggled with basic science classes. I'm not calling names, but one of the major breakthroughs in plant biochemistry of the past decade, was the work of an emeritus professor that failed in his first attempt for college. He went back to school when he was 31, at the age of 36 he had two doctorate degrees. And never got any grade even close to a B in biochemistry, his research field. 

And man, take it from someone who knows about academic success. I'm not a genius and got out of the three universities in which I had studied as the first position in the ranking. I have got academic prizes in different countries (all of them OECD members, if that's relevant for the analysis). And I can say emphatically; IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. 

I do concur in your advice of improving your knowledge if you got a low grade in a class; nonetheless, it should be in preparation for future classes or just because it is such a blessing to learn things, we're really privileged for having the chance of it. But not for a grade... leave working for a ranking position to the military and corporations, let's keep the academia as knowledge building environment.",9,1734723527.0,t1_m2y99g9

1cm44pu,l30z21a,ABigFatTomato,"‚ÄúIn most formulations, this so-called ‚Äúsolution‚Äù remains premised on the idea that in their state, Jewish citizens should continue to enjoy political privileges not enjoyed by Palestinians. Put another way, when the majority of Israelis discuss a two-state solution, they remain wedded to an ethnonational logic. It is important to stress, though, that this does not have to be the case: the notion of two states for two peoples doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that a majority-Jewish Israeli state must be ethnonationalist. One could easily imagine a liberal democratic version of Israel in which all citizens, regardless of ethnicity or religion, enjoy all the same rights, privileges, and access. Nevertheless, the truth is that the expansion of Jewish settlements into the West Bank makes the two-state solution all but impossible.‚Äù

https://jacobin.com/2023/11/hayim-katsman-gaza-war-zionism-israeli-left

how do you propose a two-state solution that doesnt lend itself to ethnonationalism or illegam settlements, when the original two-state solution was aigned by david ben-gurion with the intention of using the land granted as a foothold to expand across the entirety of palestine, and while illegal settlements currently exist in the west bank?",1,1715111271.0,t1_l2znajn

Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard, that‚Äôs already the case, Israel is far more ethnically and religiously diverse than the vast majority of nations. All Israeli citizens do enjoy the same rights, privileges etc, Arab-Israelis have become doctors, Supreme Court judges, politicians, etc. 

Germany, France, Ireland, the UK and I‚Äôd guess the rest of Europe are far less ethnically and religiously diverse, obviously most of the rest of the world is much less diverse than even Europe.",0,1715120798.0,t1_l30z21a
1cm44pu,l31qzqv,ABigFatTomato,"
‚ÄúTo take a prominent example of Israel‚Äôs nondemocratic character, the famous ‚ÄúLaw of Return,‚Äù passed in 1950, grants all Jewish people around the world the right to immigrate to Israel, even if their immediate ancestors had never lived in Palestine. In contrast, Palestinians who actually lived on the land and were displaced during the 1948 war are not only denied a corresponding ‚Äúright of return,‚Äù but are often even prohibited from visiting Israel as tourists. Moreover, the Israeli government has undertaken a project of ‚ÄúJudaization‚Äù of territory by providing legal, financial, and infrastructural support for exclusively Jewish settlement. Clearly, there is an inherent tension in Israel between the nation‚Äôs stated aspiration to grant equal rights to the entire ‚Äúdemos‚Äù and the actual policy of preserving privileges for the Jewish ‚Äúethnos.‚Äù

This tension becomes all the more obvious when one considers all the land presently under the Israeli government‚Äôs control. In East Jerusalem and the West Bank (as well as the Gaza Strip), Palestinian residents are not formally considered part of the ‚Äúdemos‚Äù: they do not have Israeli citizenship and therefore cannot vote in Israeli national elections. The Jewish settlers who live in the Occupied Territories, in contrast, enjoy the benefit of ‚Äúcarrying‚Äù their citizenship rights with them, despite the fact that neither East Jerusalem nor the West Bank are within Israel‚Äôs internationally recognized borders. There are two separate legal systems in the occupied West Bank: one for Palestinians and one for Israelis. In the West Bank city of Hebron, these different legal systems exist within the same city.‚Äù

from the same essay. in addition, that again ignores the ethnonationalist ideology present in zionism, the illegal settlements continuously expanded outside israeli territory, the expulsion of palestinians currently living in east jerusalem to make room for settlers, and the fact that even the original two-state solution was signed with the intent of israel becoming the only state in the region.",1,1715121150.0,t1_l31q2es
1cm44pu,l326tm4,1021cruisn,"Most countries allow people to obtain citizenship based on descent, heck countries like Ireland don‚Äôt even require the parent to have been born there, Italy allows descendants of Italians to get Italian citizenship indefinitely, etc. 

One of the biggest impediments to a ‚Äútwo state solution‚Äù is the Palestinian demand for a ‚Äúright of return‚Äù that would apply to the great great grandchildren who have never been to Israel. To boot, 1948 was 76 years ago so the overwhelming supermajority of those who would be eligible for the ‚Äúright of return‚Äù would be ‚Äúreturning‚Äù would fall into that category, and almost no one eligible would remember actually living in Israel in 1948. 

To the extent that the rest of your post warrants a response, there would currently be a Palestinian state if they had accepted the UN proposal and any number of proposals since. They didn‚Äôt, Israel‚Äôs neighbors ethnically cleansed Jews from their countries (whose descendants make up the majority of Jews in Israel), then told the Arabs in Israel to evacuate before the Arab armies killed the Jews in Israel. The countries who accepted these (Arab) refugees either kicked out the refugees after violent attempted coups or became failed states, to the point where Egypt refused to take back Gaza when Israel traded the Sinai for peace. 

Without defending the modern settlement program, the entire program began because the descendants of a small farming community, established around 50 years before Israel became a country by Yemeni Jews on land owned by Jews, wanted to return even after the community was ethnically cleansed repeatedly prior to its reestablishment. 

Similarly, Jews lived in Hebron for 800 years before the last Jew, an eighth generation shepherd, was forced to flee in 1948.",0,1715127394.0,t1_l31qzqv
1cm44pu,l309389,goodtimesaregood,"Sorry to hop into this thread midway but I feel BoobyChicken makes a good point here. I say this because there are multiple sources that claim that the current Prime Minister of Israel has allowed funding to go to Hamas explicitly for the purpose of allowing Hamas to continue as an organization to keep Palestine separated.    

Here is an article from the New York Times (paywall):

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/world/middleeast/israel-qatar-money-prop-up-hamas.html

I'm also not speaking to any specific circumstances of her employment, only the general policies that apply to her type of appointment and its at-will status.

The Project Policy Analyst series in the PSS (Professional Support Staff) personnel program is not a covered by a collective bargaining unit covered position. It is not considered an a-will position. 

I personally wish she did not work at the University. I find her behavior abhorrent. I am not aware of any actionable policy or regulatory offenses she's committed that justify terminating her from her position. Absent that, I don't think it's responsible to fire her. Being ""a piece of shit human being"" is subjective (even if I agree) and a dangerous criteria to justify firing someone from a government job. I could see that as a dangerous precedent even if it weren't civilly or criminally liable.

The last time I went there and my daughter needed to use the restroom, that ridiculous toilet on the sidewalk was covered in bloody feces and God knows what other bodily fluids.

The Soviets were driven out and the Mujahideen eventually became the Taliban, who then started to institute hard line Islamic law regarding women.

The tension between the majority Ghilzai Pashtuns (rural / Taliban) and the Durrani Pashtuns (urban / President Karzai‚Äôs peeps) has always existed and women did not have it easy in the 50s - 70s nor were the Soviets responsible for what you think was reality, i.e., the cherry-picked pictures of ‚Äúhappy‚Äù women running around Kabul.

1dd0mzn,l83y64f,trer24,"Mohammed Daoud Khan pursued closed relations with the Soviets upon his election as Prime Minister in the 1950s. From 1954 to 1978, Afghanistan received over $1 billion in Soviet aid which also included military assistance in exchange for allowing the Soviets to look for oil in Afghanistan. Daoud Khan and Khrushchev signed an additional agreement for economic and technical support in 1959. Meanwhile, the US was strengthening its relations with Pakistan, which is one of the reasons Afghanistan got closer to the Soviets, as they were at odds with Pakistan. So your assertion that Afghanistan and the Soviet Union did not work together until the 70s is not correct.

I did not say that women in Afghanistan had it easy in the 50s-70s, just that there were some social reforms that occurred for women in that time frame. In 1950, Purdah was abolished in Afghanistan. A new constitution established in 1964 provided the legal framework for these reforms that allowed for women to run for office, attend university, enter the workforce. Again, that's not to say it was easy, there was resistance from local leaders who didn't follow the constitution but as I said the legal framework was created and that was social reform. 

Anyways, the foreign policy pursued by the United States was not ultimately helpful to women in Afghanistan. We funded and armed the Mujahideen fighters of who some went on to start the Taliban the 90s who decided to go back to hard-line Sharia law which was objectively worse for Afghan women.",3,1718110664.0,t1_l833cox

‚Äú[Allah] transformed them into filthy, ugly animals like apes and pigs because of the injustice and evil they had brought about.‚Ä¶Oh Allah, enable us to get to the necks of the Jews.‚Äù -Hamad Al-Regeb

There is a program called Transfer File Ownership that allows you to transfer files from your UCD Google Drive to a non-UCD account. Services like Google Takeout/Transfer only make copies of the original files, which lack metadata, editing history, etc. Also, any links to the original files (e.g., forms) will be broken if you don't transfer the original files. I used the web version of TFO which gives you 100 documents for free so you can make sure it works, and there are relatively inexpensive subscriptions if you need more than that. 

  
Hope this helps someone. UCD IT ranged from unhelpful to refusing to respond to emails, and when I did get them to respond, they told me there was no way to transfer the original files.

Details first. 

Which crosswalk? There is one at the intersection of La Rue and Blue Ridge Road and there's one that's right at the edge of Lot 25. I'm going to assume it's the latter. 

That is a genuine 100% crosswalk and bicycles are allowed to to ride in crosswalks pursuant to CVC 21650(g), but note that bicyclists must always yield to pedestrians as well. 

u/grey_crawfish is 100% correct in that the ""preferred"" path of travel for wheeled transportation devices (bikes, scooters, skateboards, etc.) is *around* the lot, but this is still a legal path. It's just that those who roll across this crosswalk need to exercise caution as the path was originally built and engineered for a smaller population than currently uses it today. 

&gt; who do I gotta talk to to get this fixed?

You summoned him. I've received and given input on numerous redesigns of this multi-functional intersection as a stand-alone project and as part of larger projects. However, as it is so complex and expensive, the only thing holding us back is funding. UC Davis has received a planning grant (which they should be announcing this month) which has the goal of developing a bunch of grant-ready infrastructure projects and I hope that this is one of them.

1fyssld,lr0lj1c,GroveStreetFlocka,"This may be brute force, but if this girl is dumb (which it sounds like), you could consider waiting in that area on another day until you see a suspect matching the description. If this happened on Monday at 5:20, I would put a high likelihood that she‚Äôd be exiting around the same time another day or at least on Monday.
You could also do a quick scan of the parking lot periodically for a car looking like it matches the description, and stake out.

Luckily for you, this happened from an obvious source of where she came from, at a distinct time.

I would consider this much more difficult if it was a random high-traffic street where hypothetically anybody could come from / go to.


Lawyer up sooner rather than later. I was hit by a car while riding my bike in my hometown, didn‚Äôt even fall off my bike, but got my pinky crushed by my brake, causing blood to pool under my pinky nail and eventually make the nail fall off.
I thought about lawyering up way too late months later, and lawyers didn‚Äôt take me because it wasn‚Äôt early enough. It took months fighting with them and their insurance, but I got $5000. I‚Äôd consider bruising and abrasions to be more substantial, meaning I think you could get a much larger payout than me free-styling my settlement with no idea what I could get.

Another hopeful anecdote, my car was hit and run one night randomly while parked on the street. I got security footage of a car hitting it(couldn‚Äôt get the plate from video) I spent a few hours going up and down my neighborhood finding a car matching the description.
I sort of gave up, then two weeks later, I saw the exact car parked a block away, it turns out the guy was my neighbor across the street and was probably hiding his car from me.",16,1728429984.0,t3_1fyssld

That was the argument made by Jeff Berry, the imperial wizard of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, in a lawsuit filed in federal court last year against the city of Goshen, Ind.

Earlier in 1998, Goshen had enacted an ordinance making it illegal for a person to wear a mask or hood in public in order to conceal his or her identity. Exceptions were made for masks worn for religious, safety or medical reasons.

The law was an effort to stop the violence and, supposedly, intimidation caused by the wearing of Klan regalia and to help law enforcement apprehend criminals.

The Klan challenged the ordinance on First Amendment grounds, claiming that many of its members wear masks because they want to remain anonymous to reduce the likelihood that they will be harassed, lose their jobs or suffer other kinds of retaliation because of their unpopular ideas.

U.S. District Judge Robert Miller struck down the ordinance, holding that by ""directly chilling speech,"" the law violated the Klan's right to associate anonymously. The court pointed out that governmental officials did not show any connection between the wearing of masks and violent activity by the particular Klan group challenging the ordinance.

2) What did I kick over?  Are you referring to the lawn chair cover that they left in the middle of the sidewalk in the dark that I nearly tripped on?  Stepping on something in the dark left on a sidewalk is not the same as ""kick[ing] shit over.""

3) I did not whine.  They were and are blocking access to a public space.  They tried to intimidate me by posturing and following me.  They have set up an illegal security detail, trying to enforce their own ""rules"" without regard to what the actual rules and laws are.

4) Obsessed with kids?  No, not obsessed with any of them.  These are adults committing crimes and breaking university rules; they are not kids.  

5) I have reasons to be there that are legal that I do not feel the need to discuss.  

6) Your analysis of what is going on in there is incorrect. They are vandalizing and trashing, as well as illegally occupying part of the University.  They have also coalesced into a disruptive group of people who are disrupting finals, traffic, as well as committing other childish, yet illegal and disruptive acts.  The University should have them all arrested, publicly identified, and kicked out of the University.

-------

If you are okay with what they are doing, you are a part of the problem!  Quit egging them on.  Quit thinking that their intifada is a beautiful exercise of the First Amendment.  Intifadas often turn violent.  Do want that in Davis?  

When the UAW Union workers had their strike at UC Davis a few days ago, they were recorded chanting:  ""Al-Qassam you make us proud. Kill another soldier now. Al-Qassam you make us proud. Kill another hundred now.""  See: https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/sacramento/news/uc-davis-responds-to-video-of-pro-palestinian-march-through-campus/  

Have you seen the stolen coffee shop umbrellas that they are using for their barricades?  Is theft okay with you?  Is disrupting bus stops so students are late for their finals okay with you?  Where do you draw the line?

There are a lot of elements to this movement that you may not be aware of.  Quite frankly, they are devaluing the University.  They need to be stopped!",-4,1718255102.0,t1_l8ceag2

If you want stir stuff up and be brave, go(or try to go in) in with a monopod dual-mounting iPhone holder. Go to the access point or anywhere else, and if ask why they‚Äôre filing and/or tell you to stop, you have absolutely no reason to. You can either remain silent (this types of 1A audit videos are hilarious. People get so mad when you refuse to say anything), OR you tell them that you‚Äôre a journalist (which is not a lie, necessarily) and are documenting a story on this piece of PUBLIC land (10000% 1st amendment covered), and that you don‚Äôt share information about your pieces before they‚Äôre publish. You should even legally be able to access their (public land that we are ALL pay for via tuition or taxes) encampment without being obstructed, but that‚Äôs another ball of wax.

If they refuse to let you go take pics of the exterior of the encampment or pass  through unmolested or the keep insisting that you not allowed to road, tell them to kicks rock. And oftentimes these types will get made enough that they‚Äôll make a fool of themselves on camera and get charged and arrest.

In fact, 90% of the Middle East converted (forcefully) to Islam and became Arabized, via conquest and genocide.

Why can't both be true???

Al Jazeera Reporter cutting off interview with Gaza Citizen complaining about Hamas using citizens as shields: [https://x.com/i/status/1724696674763719162](https://x.com/i/status/1724696674763719162)

Fox News is trying to spin this as the Israelis are doing nothing wrong, Al-Jazeera is denying that Hamas hides amongst civilians and that Israel is actively targeting civilians. Why can't both be wrong?

Israel will soon surpass dropping 60,000 bombs dropped into the 5th most densely populated area in the world. The U.N is reporting that between 14,000 and 25,000 civilian deaths have happened because of these bombings. Thousands of deaths is horrible, horrible, horrible! Nobody in the world is disagreeing with that fact. But to say Israel is TARGETING civilians is simply not true. Imagine if Hamas had the opportunity to drop 60,000 bombs on Israeli cities and all got through the Iron Dome. Do you honestly believe the numbers would be comparable??? 

I think that many people who are protesting this simply don't have all the facts or simply can't understand the world isn't black and white. Netanyahu and the Likud (his political party) are absolute garbage and I can't wait to see him out of office forever. But to think Hamas deserves any sympathy whatsoever is pretty disturbing. 

Here's a few direct quotes from the Hamas Charter.

1. ""The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.""¬†- Article 7

2. ""There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors."" - Article 13 They are not interested in peace talks whatsoever. 

3. ""I swear by the holder of Mohammed's soul that I would like to invade and be killed for the sake of Allah, then invade and be killed, and then invade again and be killed."" - Article 15 

4. Allah is its target, the Prophet is its model, the Koran its constitution: Jihad is its path and death for the sake of Allah is the loftiest of its wishes. - Article 8 (This is why hiding among civilians is OK, their deaths according to Hamas are not in vain for they helped fight for the spread of Islam and the word of Allah)

5. ""If faith is lost, there is no security and there is no life for him who does not adhere to religion. He who accepts life without religion, has taken annihilation as his companion for life."" - Article 6

6. ""Woman in the home of the fighting family, whether she is a mother or a sister, plays the most important role in looking after the family, rearing the children and imbuing them with moral values and thoughts derived from Islam. She has to teach them to perform the religious duties in preparation for the role of fighting awaiting them. That is why it is necessary to pay great attention to schools and the curriculum followed in educating Moslem girls, so that they would grow up to be good mothers, aware of their role in the battle of liberation."" - Article 18 Woman are for baby making and teaching their sons to fight in the name of Islam"" - Article 18

I will say this, I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to live and grow in Gaza, especially under Hamas rule. They literally brainwash their children, and push them into believing religious extremist ideals. These protests and any protests actually help Hamas, because their greatest weapon is the gross misunderstanding of their cause. Hamas wants every single Jew out Israel at best or dead at worst. I mean the Prime Minister for Hamas literally described Osama Bin Laden as a ""Holy Warrior"", and that he condemned the killing of him.

One more thing, and congrats to you if you actually read through this entire thing. The President of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas who is considered to be the more left leaning when it comes to Political Parties in Palestine. His PhD dissertation was titled ""The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism"". It's about how the high up Nazi officials were actually Jews that orchestrated the Holocaust. Sooooo....yeah. That's what the world is dealing with.

Look at Tables 33/34 (they separate by region and by gender, respectively).

  
Note that ""from the river to the sea"" (70.4-77.7% support) is presented (by Palestinians) and answered (by Palestinians) in clear contrast to the options of   
""1 state, 2 peoples"" (2.2-7.7% support) or   
""2 states, 2 peoples""(13.3-22.7% support).

If these numbers are actually true, I don't think we'll ever see an end to this war....shit, this is depressing.

Also Table 60 really stuck out to me. 90% of people surveyed didn't know a family member that had been killed by Israel. Which is in stark contrast to what we've been seeing in the media.

Pages 8 &amp; 9: Only 19% have seen Hamas's videos. with 60% blaming media for not showing them and 20% saying they did not want to watch them.  

97% of those who didn't watch the videos thought Hamas committed no war crimes.

81% of those who **did** watch the videos thought Hamas committed no war crimes.

  
So since watching the videos is correlated with a 15% increase in belief in Hamas war crimes among those who watched, there's 2.85% of Palestinians who did change their mind when presented with evidence that they were exposed to.   
Since 60% of respondents blamed lack of media coverage, over 3x as many as those who have or those who refuse to, that might represent another 9% of Palestinians who could change their mind if exposed to evidence.",3,1717020517.0,t1_l68kplw

But how people can't see that saying ""From the River to the Sea"" is a call for Jihad to the ears of Hamas is beyond me. Hamas doesn't want to coexist. The people of Gaza don't want to coexist. I  wish there were an easy answer. 

I just see a real path for peace in that region. 

Maybe Egypt could come in and take over government control and treat it as a territory until things stabilized. Although ever since the Arab Nationalists killed assassinated Egypts president and attempted a coup there has been some bad blood there. But you'd have to have a wildly strong Gaza border and not allow any Right to Return inside Israel for reasons of safety and just potential for terrorist attacks in general. The West Bank is another can of worms where the Palestinians shot themselves in the foot on, and Israelis took advantage of. I don't know if an international court could kick out a settler considering they have all the paperwork and deeds to homes/property.

1cmdndb,l321f9k,Comrade_Corgo,"&gt;I have not seen the ties to AIPAC insofar as that is even a valid criticism.

Well first of all, you didn't even write out the name of the organization you were talking about in your comment so that anybody could look it up, you just generally called it a Jewish cultural organization, so how am I even supposed to know what organization you're talking about? I just vaguely remembered someone making a comment about some organization with a connection to AIPAC. Yes, it would be a valid criticism, because AIPAC is an organization which lobbies Congress to promote Israeli interests, with Israel being the apartheid regime that is the object of protest. 

I think any organization or company with economic ties to Israel is fair game as well, given that it is an apartheid regime [according to human rights organizations.](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/) BDS was actually a movement that originated in the battle against South African Apartheid. It is one of many tactics that were used in putting pressure on the South African Apartheid regime that would ultimately result in its end.

&gt;If someone calls for boycotting Jewish culture organizations,

The specific slogan you are complaining about was a single line on a poster board at the front of the encampment, and it specifies what it actually means by ""cultural boycott"" (nowhere does it say ""Jewish boycott""). It specifically asks to boycott Keret and study abroad to Israel. That doesn't seem too far fetched of a demand, given how Palestinians with refugee status are not legally allowed entry back to Palestine, because of the occupying regime. I think it is unfortunate phrasing for *a single line* on a poster, but it's really disingenuous for you to cherry pick it out and talk it up like it's a secret language for communicating anti-Semitism. Nowhere will you find a demand to boycott Jewish organizations lacking economic ties to Israel or which are not political action groups for Israel.

&gt;to dig in to find any possible reason to support the boycott rather than calling out the obvious surface level hate

My reason for supporting the boycott is that Israel is an apartheid regime, according to human rights organizations. The ""surface level hate"" you see is actually you trying to manipulate other people into seeing yourself and/or Israel as the victim. What do you think about Jewish students participating on the pro-Palestinian side? Are they self-hating Jews? I have seen a Jewish friend of mine be called a ""fake Jew"" by a Zionist for not unconditionally defending Israel. Most of the bigotry I have seen is from ardent defenders of Israel. Of course anti-Semitism is also on the rise, because a certain country in the world is ethnically cleansing a group of people, claiming to represent the will of the Jewish people, and people without critical thinking skills start thinking that Jews control the world when nobody does anything about it.",5,1715125225.0,t1_l31wuud

Israel does share the land they live in with other religions and people, just not the ones who wish death on them.

1dap7yj,l7mpzuc,notyourgrandad,"I think this strike is clearly an illegal political strike that breaks our contract. 

That being said, I think this decision to grant the restraining order was not this Judge‚Äôs to make. PERB is the correct forum to hear this case. A strike, even if motivated by non labor related reasons like this one is inherently a labor action. Strikes are actions between an employer and workers through the union. They are therefore under the jurisdiction of PERB, not other judges. 

The Judge ruled that because this strike is not based on employment, he therefore has jurisdiction. This is presupposing the decision that the strike is illegal to justify that the jurisdiction to make that decision in the first place. 

So let me repeat. The strike is illegal but the union contends that it is. The body that has the authority to rule on that is PERB. Until they do, other avenues of appeal should not be available. 

This is a bad day for labor exacerbated by a business doing everything it can to win in court and a union that struck for an extremely non labor issue. It is a further erosion of labor power in America. 

It is also preposterous that PERB virtually has no mechanism to rule on the matter until the strike is over anyway and the damage is already done. But that‚Äôs neither here nor there.",30,1717818847.0,t3_1dap7yj

The UC is going to take any measure to prevent people from striking that they think will be successful. In a legitimate strike they would not do that because it is not in their interest.  

The reason they are acting this way now is because this is not a labor strike. It is an illegal political strike. 

But I agree with you that the UC is basically a known quantity. They will pursue any legal avenue that has the possibility of working and any borderline illegal method like intimidation that they think might be ignored. So I am mad at the UC for doing this because it shifts what is acceptable in labor relations in America. But you can‚Äôt fully blame management for being pro management.

Then UC went around this to a Judge in the Orange County Supreme Court to get this ruling. ‚ÄúPERB filed its own motion asserting that PERB is the appropriate authority on questions of public sector labor law, and was told by the judge its motion would not be considered at this time.

So by the very thing you're trying to weaponize, it doesn't fucking matter. 

And on top of all that, not every culture treats gender the same. There are multiple tribes who believe in and recognize other genders. Considering the point of the program is educate teachers on how to respect the cultural beliefs of their native students, it'd be against the very nature of the program. Especially when native boys are subject to bullying and forced cutting of their braids in order to conform to gender ideals.

Be safe if you can, wear a helmet and knee pads to protect your one squishy slab of brain matter you have left, and if you‚Äôre on a sidewalk walking please be more mindful of your surroundings and try not to dart üéØ into the road (whether you‚Äôre walking or not) this is very common for people to do this without looking and people should pay more attention. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre safe! The ‚Äúgrazing‚Äù sounds painful as it was from metal and sharp blades so it isn‚Äôt fun by any means. Stay alert ‚ÄºÔ∏è and look up as much as possible. ‚ù§Ô∏è 

I feel like everyone can be more proactive and be more mindful of their surroundings when they‚Äôre walking or riding their bikes just like people have to be considerate when you‚Äôre driving it‚Äôs not any different. That‚Äôs why they still ticket on campus if you run stops. Unfortunately the motorists going &lt;25mph haven‚Äôt been caught yet because they‚Äôre not ‚Äúdriving‚Äù or ‚Äúriding a bike‚Äù so I feel like these individuals may feel like they‚Äôre invincible because they don‚Äôt have to pay for insurance but if they get into an accident or injure someone else‚Ä¶ guess who they‚Äôre calling‚Ä¶",3,1714113616.0,t3_1ccyisg

But so many people are operating under the assumption that power allows any of this to happen on a level playing field. Power ALWAYS has the advantage and has innumerable tricks to avoid having to concede anything.

People keep referencing the civil rights movement as the template but the civil rights movement was NOT about disruption/awareness primarily. The purpose was always to use disruption, public support, and legal/political strategy to force concessions of rights from the power structures of the day (most of which are still in place messing with progress to today).

I worry that these current protests are leaning too heavily into the first goal of disruption/awareness but neglecting the subsequent goals. Power structures will never play fair and will take any advantage to undercut the protests, so the protestors must be that much more careful and deliberate.

1d328th,l64ilhp,SeriouslyQuitIt,"&gt;Firstly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has a long history that must be looked at in its entirety. Focusing on the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas as a starting point is ignorant of this fact.

But it is *a* starting point. It's important to know the historical context, but ignoring October 7th as a turning point isn't right either.

&gt;The ongoing actions by the Israeli government to invade Palestine is wrong.

Israel 100% needed to launch a counter offensive after October 7th. It would be insane not to.

&gt;The death of civilians is wrong.

It's tragic, but ""wrong"" isn't the right word. Some civilian deaths are necessary in any war. People die.

&gt;The targeted bombings of schools and hospitals is wrong

It's not though, when said schools and hospitals are used as military infrastructure.

&gt;Anti-Semitism, showing hostility or prejudice against Jewish people, is wrong.

Well yea.

&gt;Criticizing Zionism/the State of Israel is not Anti-Semitic.

Gray area. Not all criticism of Zionism or Israel is antisemitic. Lots of it is. Lots of it isn't.

I'll agree that it isn't just by definition.

&gt;Calling for a ceasefire is not anti-Semitic.

Bilateral/Multilateral? Not antisemitic. Unilateral? 100% antisemitic or just delusional.

&gt;Being in solidarity with the Palestinian people is neither anti-Semitic nor pro-Hamas.

You're right that Oct. 7 was *a* starting point. And I do agree a response from Israel shouldn‚Äôt have been a surprise.  Now, the scale of that response is likely where you and I will disagree on, and that‚Äôs okay, you and I can think for ourselves.  

About collateral damages in war, it does happen, yes, but the numbers show that it‚Äôs much more than what should be considered ‚Äúcollateral damage.‚Äù  Civilian infrastructure shouldn‚Äôt all be destroyed.  Especially taking into account that the Israeli government issued safe-zones that they later reversed.  If it is military/Hamas infrastructure the Israeli government wants to target, I believe they have the means to do so more precisely, without the amount of civilian deaths we‚Äôve seen.

The ceasefire that I talk about in my original post is a multilateral one.  I‚Äôm calling for all bloodshed to be halted.

100%, I know what you meant but I thought it was worth stating anyway.

&gt;Civilian infrastructure shouldn‚Äôt all be destroyed.

Soft disagree. Hamas has tunnels running through all of Gaza. Plenty of civilian infrastructure is used for non civilian purposes as well.

Israel could have bombed less, but I'm not convinced that would have been the right move.

&gt;I believe they have the means to do so more precisely, without the amount of civilian deaths we‚Äôve seen.

I think this is a matter of opinion, and neither of us actually know what level of care Israel is putting into it's targeting.

The munitions used are still relatively precise (even the ""dumb bombs"" are fairly accurate from what I've read). Israel is also facing a multi front war. Using more expensive weapons on Hamas in Gaza leaves them with less to use against the more dangerous threat in Lebanon, Hezbollah.

The number of civilian deaths we've seen are not exceptional from an urban warfare standpoint. Especially when you factor in Hamas' telling civilians *not to evacuate* when given warnings to evacuate early on in the war.

&gt;account that Hamas had proposed a return of hostages along with a ceasefire that the Israeli government refused.

This is falling for the propaganda machine.

An Egyptian intelligence official modified the proposal that Israel had already agreed to with terms favorable to Hamas without having Israel or it's allies look at the modified proposal. Hamas accepted this modified proposal that Israel hadn't even seen.

1d328th,l6rces1,HatchetGIR,"So there is a lot of misinformation to unpack here, and I will try and do it all. 1) Zionism is not the belief that Israel should exist. It is the Nationalist belief that the Jewish people should establish dominance and should be an expansionist and colonialist movement to take over the land of their choosing. They are also anti Jewish as they view diasporic Jews as lesser people. 2) While it was not perfect, Jews, Arabs, and Christians live in that are and generally got along until it was given to the Zionists by England as a means to get as many Jewish people out of Europe as possible. So yeah, a single state solution would be what I think should happen. It wasn't their land to have dominance over to begin with. That said, a proper 2 state solution with the rights and boundaries of their neighbor respected would be better than this. 3) Aside from the Islamophobia and racism inherent in that statement, if by western ideology you mean being expansionist, creating an underclass of the ones in the border and Apartheid state of the ones out of it, a complete disregard for boundaries given, and the constant drive for war, then yes. If you mean what it is supposedly meant to mean, that they are supportive of LGBTQUIA+, then not entirely as you can not get married legally in Israel, and you will be looked down upon. 4) The dominant political force in Isael was rather progressive and leaned socialist, so that was crushed by Isael, and Hamas was propped up. On top of that, Palestine is nearly constantly being invaded and attacked, and the people there are kept in Apartheid conditions when they are not just forcibly removed from their homes because Israel wants them. So they attack back however they can (which isn't much or well). Those on their land are an occupational and colonial force and are therefore proper targets when they are attacked. 5) There were vastly more black people than whites in South Africa. 6) That is a false equivalence, as Ukraine is the one being colonized (like Palestine), and Israel and Russia are acting in a similar manner. Ukraine, like Palestine, should be free and not have their lands usurped by a colonialist entity. 7) It would not offend me, as they may have a legitimate point.

""Once a raccoon has found somewhere that offers food and access to water, it must then make itself a den. In rural settings, dens are often repurposed burrows dug by other animals. Wild raccoons are also known to build dens in hollow logs, below rocks or brush piles, or in hollowed trees.

""In more urban settings, a raccoon's den may be an abandoned vehicle, a chimney, an attic or crawl space, or any other protected location they can get into. They also often take refuge below homes or underneath woodpiles.

""Raccoons typically have multiple dens, and they move between them every couple of days. Because they are primarily nocturnal, raccoons during the day will be resting. These mammals are able to climb, and are sometimes seen in trees, leading some to wonder, ""Do raccoons live in trees?"" The answer is no, except in cases where a den is located inside a hollowed tree. Raccoons may climb trees in order to rest safely during the day. Most raccoons, however, will rest inside one of their dens.""",0,1732332067.0,t1_lydvxgz

Fact 1: Argentina was (and is) a safe haven for many nazis post WWII given they were searching for skilled workers with specialized experience. 

Fact 2: Argentina has the largest Jewish population of any other Latin American country.

Fact 3: Argentina was a military dictatorship from 1976‚Äì1983 under Juan Per√≥n. They had a civic militia called the junta which tortured several Jewish people. Anti-semitism was and still is rampant in Argentina. 

Fact 4: While it was known the Argentine junta tortured Jewish people in their country, Israel remained silent and continued to work closely with the dictatorship. The Israeli government suggested that selling arms to the junta was ultimately helpful to Argentinian Jewish people‚Ä¶ who continued to face prejudice and torture (women, for example, were faced with exclusive torture techniques and nazi paraphernalia littered across these torture grounds). Obviously selling arms to the junta did not achieve any relief for the Argentinian Jewish people. At this point, one may question, ‚Äúwhy would a country that is supposed to be dedicated to preserving Jewish life, culture, and identity not oppose the torture of Jewish people?‚Äù (Hint: See Fact 5)

Fact 5: Israel wanted Argentinian support for the West Bank. They surprisingly stayed silent on the issue of torture of Jewish people because they knew speaking up on this would potentially lead to Argentinians revoking support. Israel has yet to comment on this working relationship. 

Soooo yeah, Hamas is a terrorist group that rapes women (surprising‚Ä¶ no one, because they are well, terrorists). But Israel has been complicit in the torture (including rape) of thousands of Jewish people in the name of extending their occupation into the West Bank. As if stealing Palestinian homes in the West Bank is more important than maintaining the wellbeing of Jewish people across the globe, but that‚Äôs a discussion you‚Äôll have to take up with the Israeli government. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Edit: Oh, and yeah, selling terrorists, militias, and dictatorships arms so that they can carry out genocide absolutely does make you an accomplice in it. Hold Israel to the same standards that you would any other country doing this shit. Israel doesn‚Äôt get a pass simply because it‚Äôs the Jewish state. They continue to sell arms and military tech because it‚Äôs big money. It‚Äôs exactly what Ben Gurion wanted to do from the beginning because he wanted to situate Israel as a global power in the MidEast. They sold arms to the Burmese to help eradicate the Rohingya Muslim minority, they sold arms to the Hutus to eradicate the Tutsis, and they sold arms to the Sri Lankans to eradicate the Tamils. These are all examples of genocide and are taught and recorded that way. Israel went out of its way to make connections with these problematic groups and CONTINUE to invite them into Israel, hold secret meetings with them, and have ongoing diplomatic relations.

that was also such a garbage strawman, but if youre going to put words in my mouth, what I would say is that the new charter is a clarified version, that updates the language to fit more with the times (removing some of the more religious language, and changing outdated terminology like ‚Äúmoslem‚Äù) and removes what critics called antisemitic or genocidal language. it was also updated *7 years ago*, not 10 minutes ago.

in regards to the statements that mention jews in the original charter, I would also use a quote from historian norman finkelstein, which he said in regards to how he reconciles his support for the houthis, whose flag calls for ‚Äúa curse upon the jews,‚Äù with his jewish identity:

‚ÄúI have no problem reconciling it for this very simple reason, and you‚Äôll allow me‚Ä¶ You can disagree. I have no problem with that.

From my first conscious moments in my own life, my parents loathed the Germans. They didn‚Äôt loathe the Nazis. They loathed, they hated the Germans. In fact, I vividly recall, my father once recommended me a book on the Nazi Holocaust. And I asked him, ‚ÄúWhat makes this book special?‚Äù And he said to me, ‚ÄúI liked it, that the author didn‚Äôt talk about Nazis. He talked about Germans.‚Äù

Now, my parents were very decent human beings, the apple did not fall far from the tree, but I could understand that sentiment. The only Jews the Houthis have known are the Israelis. It‚Äôs a regrettable fact that they don‚Äôt know, have never experienced any other kinds of Jews.

I remember I once asked my mother, just out of curiosity, ‚ÄúDid you ever meet, did you ever come into contact with a German who was decent?‚Äù And she said to me, she thought hard, and she said, ‚ÄúI remember one German soldier. He had a kind of guilty look on his face.‚Äù That was all she could remember. One. So it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that she loathed all Germans.

Do I wish the Houthis were more discriminating in their slogans? Of course, I wish it, but do I understand where it comes from? Yes. And will that slogan of theirs color my appreciation of the fact that alone among the world‚Äôs peoples, they are resorting to armed force to stop the genocide in Gaza? I have to ask myself the question, how would my parents have felt if this ragtag army happened to be situated on the point in the world‚Äôs map where they could inflect the outcome of the Final Solution? And these people, this ragtag people hailing back to the Middle Ages, they were investing all of their physical resources and moral energy to stopping the extermination. How would my parents react? Would they ask, ‚ÄúWhat are their political slogans?‚Äù I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

in regards to the the hamas charter, what they did was exactly what finkelstein wishes of the houthis (that ‚Äú[they] more discriminating in their slogans‚Äù), changing language that conflates the jewish people as a whole with the actions of, and the atrocities committed by, the state of israel.

regardless, the original claim was that the current hamas charter calls for genocide, when it explicitly does not. we are in university; making a claim that a current document states something, using a biased interpretation of the outdated 35 year old version of the document that was massively overhauled 7 years ago, instead of using the current document to make a claim about what the current document explicitly says, would not be good practice.",-7,1718517073.0,t1_l8tmzbw

Family life: Many Arab Israelis have Gazan and West Bank spouses and those spouses cannot take up residence with their Arab Israeli spouse the same way the spouse of Jewish Israelis can. Now this was ostensibly a temporary law in response to terrorist attacks carried out by Palestinians who entered Israel through spousal reunification but, both rime ministers Ariel Sharon and Yair Lapid both openly stated that the law was crafted for demographic reasons and was not really meant to be temporary.

National self-determination: Israel's basic law (equivalent to a constitution) states that: ""The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people"". Translation only Jews and not Israeli citizens as a whole will determine what the state of Israel looks like. I can't remember who said it but, a prominent Likud politician also suggested that this could be used to form the constitutional pretext for the spousal reunification ban if there was ever a peace deal (meaning the security pretext would expire) because Israel also defines the right to self-determination as the ""right"" to not have ""too many"" of the ""wrong"" ethnic group around. A definition used literally nowhere else on earth even by others who hate having the ""wrong"" ethnic group around.

Language rights: Arabic used to be an official language in Israel until they amended the basic law to downgrade it to a ""special status"" which is among the pettiest things I've ever seen a government do.

Housing: Israel's admission committee laws allows small towns and villages to reject residency or home purchase to those who they deem ""socioculturally incompatible"" with the community.

im assuming youre referring to the 1948 arab-israeli war, which was not just the arab league invading unprovoked as many zionists like to act. instead, it happened directly after a campaign of israeli massacres like the one at deir yassin under plan dalet, with the deir yassin massacre causing mass palestinian panic and flight, which put so much pressure to act upon the arab league from both palestinians and their own people, that it forced them to invade, even alienating the leaders that had been leaning towards peace.

in regards to rockets, in what world are the unguided and primitive rockets launched from an oppressed people in any way similar to the billions of dollars of united states military tech used to oppress them? 

in regards to suicide bombings, i would ask you to consider the reason that some people felt so hopeless as to do such a thing in resistance.

mass murder? this historically has been far more commonly directed *at* the palestinian people, not from them. the palestinian population has historically been slaughtered en masse by israeli forces. 

in regards to mass rape, while there are credible reports of sexual assault and rape committed on october 7th (which i assume youre talking about, and which are terrible and deplorable), there are also credible reports of the israel weaponizing sexual assault and rape against palestinians held in israeli torture camps, many of whom are held without charge or crime. 

zionism has been used to justify mass atrocities against the palestinian population, as well as their continued occupation and oppression. you can blame it on hamas all you want, but the fact is that hamas exists as a reaction to israeli violence against palestinians. slaughtering tens of thousands of palestinian men, women, and children to kill a few hamas members only serves to ensure more extremism.",1,1718567768.0,t1_l8w5q0x

yes, the group that performed 10/7 is the same one that previously had charter with language that was interpreted by some as genocidal. I would like to ask you, what other groups do you judge by outdated and overhauled party platforms written by individuals who arent even in power anymore? by that logic, the democratic party still supports slavery and agrarianism.

and yes, it would look bad to have a charter that could be interpreted in such a way, hence why it was changed to add clarification, more modern language, and to remove the heavy religious references, and quotes from other individuals, to clarify their current stance. i also think its important to recognize the context in which that charter was written, in the 80s in the middle east, in the direct midst of united states destabilization of the region, with religious and secular tensions high.

that quote, from what i gather from reading the full 1988 charter, is from the prophet Mohammad. the charter isnt creating that specific quote, it is taking that quote and abstracting it to the current struggle. but yes, that could very much be interpreted as genocidal intent, although again the entire charter has been changed now with regards to the different context, times, and focuses. if you want to talk about a modern entity using religious quotes with genocidal intent, i would point you to netanyahu and his amalek rhetoric, which is steeped in genocidal intent, and is actually currently relevant.

1dgtsnq,l8tgtda,Sea_Magazine_5321,"&gt;that is the 1988 charter, which has been much revised since. they do not currently have a charter that says those things, as you originally claimed. using a 35 year old document that is radically out of date and has been massively updated to make current claims is not good practice in an academic setting.

So you recognize that the hamas government charter was founded on genociding the jews

Your claim is, ""prior to oct 7, *they took out ""all the calls for genocide""*, therefore it is no longer about genociding jews""?

&gt;you also didn‚Äôt even link the old hamas charter, but an israeli discussion about it, the very country they are opposing, and the one that has the most bias against them. 

*The link contains the hamas charter* - but youre upset that *israelis are pointing out the genocidal parts*?

&gt;that is not to say the old charter doesn‚Äôt say those things, but that the source is atrociously biased. 

So *the charter calls for genocide* - but the source is ""atrociously biased""?

&gt;this is hamas current charter, and the one you should be referencing when you claim that hamas currently has a charter that says certain things: 

&gt;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-2017-document-full

So hamas repeatedly says they want to eliminate the jews, but *they revised their charter*

So its all good now?

No more oct 7?

&gt;it is not ignoring facts to understand that you made a blatantly untrue claim that hamas‚Äô charter currently has something written in it that it explicitly does not. 

Certainly a lot of loaded words, just to say ""yeah they used to call for genocide - but they totally changed their minds"" (now ignore oct 7)

&gt;what hamas had written in its previous charter is different discussion entirely to what you originally, falsely, claimed.

Hamas USED to call for genocide.

After 35 years, they totally crossed out the genocidal parts

So no way they can be genocidal, right?

At least fake like you care about Palestinians (like maybe have a Palestinian speaker at the DNC in addition to Israelis). 

Don't talk about how much you want unity with the people taking our rights away, like parading around Liz Cheney, saying how you want a Republican on your cabinet, constantly seeking to siphon votes from the right. Don't cede to right wing narratives and allow them to control the conversation over immigration, for example.",2,1730966136.0,t1_lvt1zjx
1gkvvop,lw0lk4j,THE_GIANT_PAPAYA,"I agree that would have been a better campaign (in the sense that it aligns with my politics) but I'm skeptical it would've made Harris any more successful.

1) if policy mattered she would've won in a landslide. Americans have experienced four years of fairly progressive Democratic policy and, even though Biden's term was objectively an overwhelming economic success, Americans are still unhappy with the results. Trump's policies are regressive inflationary garbage, yet he still won decisively.

2) if Palestine mattered then Americans wouldn't have such shockingly high turnout for Trump, who is blatantly anti-Palestinian. Not only did his base turn out, but he flipped many Democratic voters. According to Pew, foreign policy was only the third or fourth most important issue to American voters. Democrats cared even less about foreign policy than Trump supporters.

3) Democrats are extremely unpopular when it comes to immigration policy. We lost control of that narrative a long long time ago. Reuters polling found that two thirds of Americans thought our immigration policy was on the wrong track, and Trump was beating Harris on the issue by over 10%. If anything, ceding ground made Democrats more mainstream. Take Ruben Gallego for example. From his campaign website: ""while our border communities are not the war zones that news stations often portray them as, they are facing a serious crisis. We need smart ways to keep our border secure, allow for a prosperous cross-border economy, reform a broken immigration system, and stop the flow of fentanyl into our communities."" This platform has undoubtedly helped Gallego win his senate race.

But you certainly have a point about Liz Cheney. Associating with the establishment is not a good look. Americans want change, and the Cheneys absolutely do not represent change.

I don't think any Democrat would have been able to win this race. At most, a more radical campaign could have boosted turnout in urban areas. Maybe Pennsylvania would have been 1% closer instead of the 2% margin it's on track for. But at the end of the day, anyone with a D next to their name represents the status quo. No campaign could have fixed that.",2,1731034908.0,t1_lvv51hx

When Democrats fail to even pretend like they care about Palestinians, it gives Trump the opportunity to lie and say he will be different when he won't. Americans don't have an option to punish their politicians besides voting for the opposition party or just not voting.

&gt;We need smart ways to keep our border secure, allow for a prosperous cross-border economy, reform a broken immigration system, and stop the flow of fentanyl into our communities.""

Here you are ceding to the right wing framing on the border. No, loads of fentanyl are not coming across the border because it is insecure. Fentanyl primarily enters the country through legal ports of entry. Undocumented immigrants are not prone to committing crimes more than American citizens.

&gt;But at the end of the day, anyone with a D next to their name represents the status quo. No campaign could have fixed that.

FDR won like 3 or 4 terms in a row for a reason. I'm firmly in the camp that someone like Bernie Sanders would have the ability to pick up low propensity voters the way Trump does because they both propose things radically different from the status quo, with the difference being advocating for massive social democratic reforms versus scapegoating large portions of the population for economic problems. People associate Democrats with the status quo because it's all they seem to advocate for.",2,1731036857.0,t1_lw0lk4j
1gkvvop,lw135rw,THE_GIANT_PAPAYA,"&gt;Here you didn't say a good policy she proposed and advocated for, you just said Trump's policies are bad.

I'm not expressing my point clearly enough. Voters don't actually care about policy because the average person doesn't have any clue how policy works. Trump's policies do the opposite of what voters want: they increase inflation. Yet, he still won. This indicates that voters want \_change\_, not necessarily progressivism. If Trump had presided over four years of inflation, then progressivism would've represented change and a progressive candidate would have won. Harris is the VP, and therefore she is not a change. Even if Harris had campaigned on a radical leftist platform, voters would not understand nor would they care, because she's the incumbent party.

&gt;When Democrats fail to even pretend like they care about Palestinians, it gives Trump the opportunity to lie and say he will be different when he won't. Americans don't have an option to punish their politicians besides voting for the opposition party or just not voting.

What about the polling I cited? How does your theory reckon with the fact that Americans don't care very much about Palestine?

&gt;Here you are ceding to the right wing framing on the border. No, loads of fentanyl are not coming across the border because it is insecure. Fentanyl primarily enters the country through legal ports of entry. Undocumented immigrants are not prone to committing crimes more than American citizens.

I know all that stuff is nonsense! I think again I haven't made my point clear. It doesn't matter what the truth is. Voters are convinced that our immigration system is fundamentally flawed and they have been convinced of this for years. If Harris had campaigned on being factually correct, people wouldn't have listened. We saw this in 2016 and 2020. Immigration is a losing issue for Democrats because two thirds of Americans perceive Democrats as being soft, and this is especially true in swing states like Arizona. Where would Ruben Gallego be right now if he had campaigned on a purely factual immigration narrative? He wouldn't be outperforming Harris, that's for sure.

&gt;I'm firmly in the camp that someone like Bernie Sanders would have the ability to pick up low propensity voters the way Trump does because they both propose things radically different from the status quo, with the difference being advocating for massive social democratic reforms versus scapegoating large portions of the population for economic problems. People associate Democrats with the status quo because it's all they seem to advocate for.

I am also in this camp. I do think Bernie would pick up low propensity voters, but it wouldn't be because his policies are better than the status quo. It would be because of narrative. Low propensity voters, almost by definition, have very little understanding of what good policy is and how it works. As I've said earlier, they only care about change. Trump won with them because he spun up a convincing narrative that he's the anti-status quo candidate, despite the fact that his policies will exacerbate the status quo. Bernie would be able to do the same. Voters perceive Bernie as an outsider, and he's literally not even a Democrat. 

This is my point: Harris didn't have a campaign problem, she had a candidate problem. If she was literally a different person, things would've been different. No amount of campaigning could fix the fact that she is Vice President Kamala Harris, the woman who just presided over four years of inflation.",0,1731041464.0,t1_lw0r17o
1gkvvop,lw1fkgh,Comrade_Corgo,"If you don't actually want to believe people when they say what would motivate them to vote for your candidate, don't ask. It feels like you just want to believe there wasn't anything the Democrats possibly could have done to get a better outcome. Good luck winning elections with that attitude. You can't improve if you don't learn any lessons from your mistakes.

I didn't say Harris lost only because of Palestine, it's one of many failures that contributed to the overall defeat. No, a lot of Americans do not care about Palestine, but enough did to make an impact especially in Michigan, which is a swing state that her team abandoned because of her stance on Palestine alienating the large Arab population there.

&gt;This is my point: Harris didn't have a campaign problem, she had a candidate problem. If she was literally a different person, things would've been different. No amount of campaigning could fix the fact that she is Vice President Kamala Harris, the woman who just presided over four years of inflation.

Then the Democrats could have had an open primary or chosen somebody else. This excuse still lays the fault of the loss on the Democrats. Is it because any Dem would have lost like you said before, or just because she's Vice President? I guess whatever answer lays blame on voters and not anybody in a position of power.

&gt;Voters perceive Bernie as an outsider, and he's literally not even a Democrat. 

Bernie caucuses with Democrats and ran in the Democratic Primaries for president. People think of him as a Democrat, as well as an outsider, like how Trump is a Republican but a supposed establishment outsider.",2,1731047371.0,t1_lw135rw
1gkvvop,lw1jkjv,THE_GIANT_PAPAYA,"I don't understand why you're taking on an aggressive tone, or why you're accusing me of not wanting to learn any lessons. I want a more progressive campaign in the future, as do you. We are on the same team. I just disagree with the idea that Harris' campaign was the reason for her defeat. Instead, I argue that she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, meaning that even if she had run an uber-progressive campaign she still would have lost. Polling and counterfactuals  back up my argument. Polls indicate that people care most about inflation yet vote for Trump because they like his inflationary policies. Counterfactuals show that Covid inflation is the death of all incumbent governments this year, including progressive ones (e.g: Queensland Labor/Greens in Australia).

&gt;I guess whatever answer lays blame on voters and not anybody in a position of power.

I have no idea when I expressed this position. That is not my position. For the final time, I agree that Democrats need to run someone anti-establishment in the future and that the status quo is not good enough. You're cannibalizing a fellow progressive.

The difference is that when I say the IDF is wrong to attack all Palestinians, I'm not saying the population of Israel should be punished for the idfs actions. I'm saying their political and military leaders should be held responsible.

When you say hamas is wrong to attack Israeli citizens, it's in defense of the idf harming all Palestinians out of revenge. It's not in support of a highly trained military conducting anti-insurgency raids, it's in support of indiscriminate bombing. (And either the bombing is indiscriminate or the bombs are deliberately hitting civilian encampments). And it certainly isn't in support of holding hamas responsible. 

You use them as an excuse to hurt people - which makes sense because that's why likud (Israeli political party led by netanyahu) FUNDED hamas. Bibi himself suggested that this funding supported Israeli interests by eliminating support for peaceful Palestinian movements that might have established an actual state. Because what hard liners like Netanyahu want is to take all of Gaza and the west bank for Israeli occupation, not to make peace with the Muslims.

1d7oipo,l7562t6,[deleted],"You've got to look at demographics. The population skews unusually young. Palestinian men tend to go to prison or get killed; and whether you think that's their own fault or not, there just aren't many adults capable of resisting hamas. And those that might have often suffered enough trauma and tragedy that they instead say something like, ""I don't support hamas but I'm happy they attack the people who hurt me.""

Asking for palestine to resist hamas is like telling them to just leave gaza. They would if they could.

I don't hate Israel as a concept, nations are arbitrary constructions already. I wish they had been more responsible in how they governed the area and the way they displaced people was just wrong. Trail of tears kinds of wrong. I don't have an easy answer for how to fix things when both sides have said and done vile things. Anyone who has heard right-wing Israeli media could rattle off a long list of common slurs against arabs. The rhetoric from each is awful. 

The difference I see is that whatever revenge fantasies the average Palestinian might harbor, they have no hope of accomplishing genocide against the israeli people or the jewish faith. Likewise, regardless of how nice the average Israeli might be, their country has committed multiple war crimes, lied about it, and is given a free pass by some because they were determined to be ""the right side"" before I was even born.

In simplistic terms, I guess I don't like it when someone punches down and lies to my (metaphorical) face about it. The justifications that are offered also remind me uncomfortably of the jingoistic fervor immediately following the wtc attack.

All things being the way they are, I don't attend protests. I do feel like I have a more informed and nuanced pov than most, though, and my stance remains don't kill kids. You can come up with variations on the trolley problem, ""what if killing an innocent kid saves a dozen other innocent kids"" - but I feel that this ignores the fact that in our very real, not-hypothetical, world children are being slaughtered in large numbers and israel isn't saving anyone by doing this. They have barely made an effort to locate the hostages that were taken and have even killed a few by accident using arms and tactics that are irresponsibly scattershot in their effects.

Just don't kill thousands of children in a weird revenge tantrum. How many kids have you killed? I bet the answer is zero. Me too! Look how easy it has been for us to not explode children! I believe Israel could choose to show the same concern for the neighbors kids as they do their own, no matter how they feel about the neighbors themselves.

I also got lucky with my job after graduation in that I just happened to be there at the right time to get promoted quickly and get salary raises that the department had been fighting for for the past decade. Went from $56k to $116k within 5 years. Also the job market was pretty good for graduates in 2018. 

But definitely the posts on here overall are not going to reflect the norm. Even many of those who graduated with me and got tech jobs starting over 6 figures have gotten laid off in the past year and may have to take massive paycuts just to find a job.  I originally felt self conscious having a starting salary that was half of that of many of my friends and family friends telling me I need to change industries. 

Times and circumstances always change and some will be lucky and others unlucky.

1dlu0p4,l9unfvx,thezander8,"&gt;Seriously like everyone is out here making 6 digits?

The median redditing Davis grad might actually make about 6 figures. According to the feds, median 10-year earnings for aid recipients at UCD is $80k -- I'm wondering if the overall population is higher because I'm thinking that Bay Area families might qualify for less aid but have more connections/privileged outcomes for kids (anecdotally, my dad and my then-gf's dad who were both engineers answered questions about homework at times, and I know other friends who were able to get their starts in the Bay by staying with family).

Also, not only is there a self-selection thing going on like the previous comment said but I suspect the redditing alumni community skews to tech as well. 

This is not to say that it there should be an expectation or judgement about making six figures out of college; I'm the same as you in that I know plenty of people who didn't. And then I was a broke grad student for two years and then wasn't anywhere close to $100k in the first few years I was in the workforce even with bonuses and overtime.

Slightly off topic, but many people don‚Äôt look out to retirement when they are applying for jobs early in their careers, however state employment comes with a slightly less competitive pay than private sector, but comes with a pension and health care in retirement that is pretty incomparable to most other employers. For example, for a 30 year career in the state, you can expect to get about 70% of your highest salary for the remainder of your life if you retire at 66 (you can retire earlier, you just get slightly less for a pension). For instance, an ending salary of $130k would earn about $92k per year for the rest of your life at 70%. To be able achieve the same income using savings and the 4% rule for retirement, you would have to save about $2.3M. That‚Äôs $2.3$ that you didn‚Äôt have to save for retirement because of the pension. And lifetime healthcare only increases the value of these benefits. Just something for young graduates to think about. Pensions are based in years of service, so the more years you put in, the better they are, so it pays to start early.",65,1719070833.0,t3_1dlu0p4
1dlu0p4,l9scg3j,thezander8,"Yup, glad someone wrote this out. The private employers offering six figures to new grads will not and cannot offer a financial instrument as good as even the most watered down current version of the state pension.

(OK maybe in a super high-interest rate environment they could, but they also wouldn‚Äôt be throwing money at new grads in that environment.)",19,1719076524.0,t1_l9rxfc7
1dlu0p4,l9t4irx,roughseasbanshee,excellent advice. all i care about in locking down a forever career is being able to get in on that sweet CA state pension. we should all still save a bit even if you're getting pensions though,7,1719087208.0,t1_l9rxfc7
1dlu0p4,l9sjurm,ultimaforever,"Can the state revise your pension benefits down, say after you retire, or are you absolutely guaranteed that post-retirement pay?  I imagine that‚Äôd ignite a legal firestorm but is that a risk?",2,1719079299.0,t1_l9rxfc7
1dlu0p4,l9sqn4y,thezander8,"Complicated answer ‚Äî my understanding is that right now the possibility only exists in the court system, like a judge could rule that the pension guarantee doesn‚Äôt have the weight of a binding contract the way it‚Äôs currently treated.

FWIW though, the state has been revising pensions for new ‚Äúcohorts‚Äù of employees over the  years, recently downwards. This means that a) if you‚Äôre a new employee these days your pension is a lot more ‚Äúachievable‚Äù than the promised benefits in previous years that the state is still paying for and b) the politically and legally easier path for future revisions would be to again revise promises for new employees downward rather than adjust the benefits for existing employees who already came in with certain expectations.",3,1719081879.0,t1_l9sjurm
1dlu0p4,l9suawl,Quiet_Amount5209,"This is correct. Legally it comes down to something called ‚Äúthe California rule‚Äù which pension law around the country relies on as I understand it. Basically it says that what you were promised when you started is like a contract and must be honored when you retire. There has been legal challenges to this rule although as of yet, it hasn‚Äôt been dismantled. Although even if this occurred, I believe the California constitution ensures a ‚Äúreasonable pension‚Äù for state workers. So even if it were not what you were promised when you started, I believe state workers would get something. It just may not be as beneficial as what was promised. This certainly would ignite a firestorm though as there are 200k state workers and I‚Äôm sure any changes would face many legal challenges. I hedge against this by doing some retirement saving in a small scale on my own in case my pension is ever reduced (although I doubt it would be).",5,1719083272.0,t1_l9sqn4y

1dlu0p4,l9thceu,BakedAndHalfAwake,Kinda curious if anyone would be cool with sharing tips on applying since that seems to be a more popular method here. Did you curate where you applied to the places you were most interested in or end up casting a wider net? Was there anything at UCD that particularly helped you while finding a job?,4,1719092127.0,t3_1dlu0p4
1dlu0p4,l9ttbj0,thezander8,"My tips as both a prior applicant and application reviewer would be to apply to as many places as you reasonably can *while still putting together quality, specific, applications*. The last part is key, you ideally shouldn't be firing off the exact same generic cover letter and resume to every company (or government agency), especially for the popular, general entry-level roles. You'll want to specifically emphasize what about your experience or education makes you a good fit for the role and directly address all questions / required submissions for the application.

On a similar note, do your homework both by reading the job posting and instructions closely and also consulting relevant forums, for example the subreddit for the related field. 

If a position required a cover letter or statement of qualifications, I think I would spend minimum 1 hour and more likely 3-5 hours on it for a typical application. If it was for a job I was very, very interested in, I would often write one from scratch. And I'm just talking about the time I spent writing text, this doesn't include the online application form which would be an as-long-as-it-takes type deal to make sure I was filling every field correctly. So you're looking at 1-2 applications submitted per evening if you're diligent, maybe up to 6 or 7 in a weekend.

In terms of UCD-specific resources, it's worth it to run your resume by the career center and also go to the career fairs. Even if you're still applying to the job online, it's worth it to talk to recruiters about the process because a) they might introduce you to new roles or opportunities you hadn't wondered about yet and b) they can advise you on how to dot your i's and cross your t's because they want to see a bunch of quality applicants come in.",9,1719097071.0,t1_l9thceu

4. I'm an Accountant, graduated, Dec 2019. Currently studying for my CPA. Know your industry and the jobs. In my industry in Accounting, so many people have a misconception that Public Accounting firms are the only jobs, and that's absolutely false. Worked for one once for 3 months and hated it. Those kind of jobs suck. Instead I work internally for companies.       Start where you can and then look from there. I started at the very bottom, Accounts Payable specialists, but then looked for better paying higher positions. Don't be like the Boomer generation and work for one company your entire life. They don't care about you and will not pay you for your dedication. You can also make so much more money by going to a new job wether it's vertical or horizontal job switching. Also use job searching sites, like in my industry in Accounting, Robert Half is a good one, they tend to get you better jobs than just looking for jobs that are posted. If a job is a good one, why wouldn't a company use a recruiter rather than just post online.",3,1719081604.0,t3_1dlu0p4

if it was as simple as ""social media is making us conservative because fake news"" then you would see a shift to the right from both genders. however, i believe that the current trends reflect a much more complicated state of reality, that reflects the dwindling prospects of young men.

in 2023, the NYT reporter ezra klein interviewed richard reeves, a brookings institute researcher who wrote the book ""Of Boys and Men Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do about It"", which I think is an insightful source on the roots of this problem. To summarize it briefly, there are systemic markers that young men are not performing as well in school, and are underachieving compared to where they have been historically. What this ultimately results in is a male populace that is resentful of the status quo, and therefore gravitate towards reactionary forces. I think in order for the Democratic Party to win back the young male vote, it is necessary for them to address these issues in a meaningful way.

In California obviously our view on who‚Äôs winning is going to be skewed because we‚Äôre gonna assume a lot of people are going to vote Democrat, especially in the area we live in. We also have media that pushes content to us based off of our preferences which again is going to skew what we believe. The fact is she came to the race pretty late, which is not her fault, and I think she did really well with the time she had. I believe she actually did another debate It would‚Äôve been possible that her popularity grew. The truth is she never had the support certain media wants you to believe possibly because of the amount of time she had it the fact it seemed like she at times couldn‚Äôt give a straight answer. Even looking at what Bernie Sanders said we have abandoned the middle class and working class people. Trump, whether you like him or not, is a businessman and is able to connect to people and get their emotions going. When we add in progressive issues that moderate/slightly left, leaning people may slightly disagree about with more extremist telling them ‚Äúthen you aren‚Äôt liberal‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a conservative‚Äù ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù is going to make people want to slant the other way. Also, if you‚Äôre paying attention to both news outlets/what Trump is saying we have a governor who is a Democrat who cant account to where all the money he has spent to go to help / house those who are homeless. Which trump claims he is gonna force him to show the documents for, and if you‚Äôre a moderate person (in California)who is conserved with our taxes, that sounds like a wonderful thing to have happen. But besides that we can see people admit on this form that they would not vote for Kamala due to her spending in wars overseas.

They will always struggle if u try to fight for cause that supports minority of the population although thats is the right thing to do. But in reality differences between right things to do and things to do to win is huge. Majority of the people are motivated by self interest not collective interests. Majority of the folks don‚Äôt care about vulnerable people across the border who can‚Äôt vote. Even if they were let in and became citizens they will vote republican in future to lower their taxes and stop further migration coz they get threatened from new, young, strong and hungry to work for money migrants. 
Stop advocating policies that target poor people of the society. If that strategy worked then West Virginia and Mississippi should be bluer than California. 
Stop lumping all brown and black people in one group as minorities. Black people are motivated by policies like justice reform and eradicating discrimination whereas brown folks especially Asian doesn‚Äôt feel same. They are motivated by law and order and security.
Please stop talking about union high paying with benefited job. Instead talk about job, job, job regardless if its well paid with benefits. Just see the example of Michigan and southern states that has car manufacturing plants that repeatedly refuse to unionize.
Stop worrying about the world except Israel (birth place of Jesus) since majority of christians who are loyal voters still believe we ought to save birthplace of Jesus.",1,1731012869.0,t3_1gl6ffv

But let me honest the Palestine Israel war is damned if you do damned if you don‚Äôt for either side period. I‚Äôve heard the Trump says he‚Äôs gonna make sure that this war ends I‚Äôve heard the opposite. I think I read the other day that Hamas is willing to end the war, due to Trump becoming our president again, because it‚Äôs in the best interest of the Palestinian people. Even Israeli officials said they are looking forward for the administration to bring about a more peaceful Middle East. What does that look like? Not sure. But at the moment we know both sides are willing to start to make progress towards ending the war. The fact is, we can‚Äôt look into a crystal ball and know that if Kamala were to become president if the war would‚Äôve ended or if she would‚Äôve kept sending money to both sides (if I‚Äôm correct). Will Palestinians and Israelis going to be best friends tomorrow because of the election outcome ? Probably not I mean there‚Äôs soooo much history that I believe we all can‚Äôt even truly comprehend even if we learn about it or read about it. but I think it‚Äôs a start to making things better, I think it‚Äôs a start for Israelis getting hostages back (which they claim they‚Äôll stop attacking once they get them back) and it‚Äôs a start to having a cease fire.

&gt;¬†Hello again everyone, this is Sarah. I first wanted to thank our old neighbor Lise for setting up this GoFundMe for us during this difficult time. I also want to thank every single person who has either donated or shared this GoFundMe. While I won‚Äôt be able to thank everyone individually, I wanted to share my gratitude on behalf of my whole family.¬†

&gt; Unfortunately, there have been no updates in our search for Diane. My dad has been talking with the police (both at UC Davis and in SF) frequently over the past 10 days and there still has been no signs of Diane at this time. Since her belongings were found by the pier, the SF PD, US Park Police, and the Coast Guard highly suspect the chance of her being in the water is higher so they have been continuously searching every day for any signs of Diane in the water with no success. In addition, my dad has been searching the local coastline daily in case of any signs of Diane there. Currently, she is considered a missing person by the police. Per the police, the likelihood of Diane being found alive is slim due to how much time has passed but we‚Äôre still continuing the search in hopes that we find Diane.¬†

&gt; Thank you again from the bottom of my heart for all of the support.

1esj1ju,li9nksk,JaneDark,"this is a common misconception. As we get told in every intro to Econ course, prices are set according to the highest price the market will bear ‚Äî if it is set too low, the seller won‚Äôt recoup, but if set too high, other sellers will undercut the price and the first seller will be obliged to lower their prices. So we can assume, via market equalization, the highest possible market price is already in place. So a seller cannot simply raise prices because of shrinkage. It‚Äôs just not possible (without coordinated price fixing).

1esj1ju,li8qodf,Comrade_Corgo,"Theft is a negligible reason for price increases. The media loves to focus on narratives about rampant crime, but crime has been on the decline if you look at the data. I would chalk up these narratives to fear mongering.

&gt;Larceny has been declining nationally since 1990, with an especially steep decline in 2020 and 2021, followed by a rebound in 2022. Focusing on recent years, the larceny rate fell from roughly 1,573 offenses per 100,000 people in 2019 to just over 1,300 in 2021, before rebounding to around 1,400 in 2022. Taken together, that is a decline of around 10 percent since 2019.

Bikes and scooters do not go fast enough to where a competent operator cannot avoid a collision. In basically every case, if you look further ahead, you can anticipate and react to oncoming threats. You don't even have to stop most of the time. Just slow down a bit preeemptively to barely miss a biker, or veer to the left or right to go around a pedestrian. This is common knowledge. Anyone who goes at a decent speed should know this. If you don't, you are too incompetent to be on the road, and should consider getting better at riding a scooter/bike. 

Additionally, most of the people who go here do not know how to stop properly on a bike/scooter. You can stop on a bike in about  10ft or less (if u are going slow) just by using proper technique. Just apply max front brake, around a third to half the back brake, and throw your bodyweight over the back wheel. You can apply a similar principle to an electric scooter, though to a lesser extent.

1fuskfi,lq1su99,AnteaterToAggie,"Tips from an Inland Empire native who ended up in Davis: 

**Wear a hat and baggy clothes**

The temperature you see on your Weather app is ""air temp"" or ""temperature in the shade"". If you're in the sun, you're feeling solar radiation as well which will add 10F-20F depending on the season and clarity of the sky. Block that sun from your head and face with a hat. Tight clothes will just transfer the heat directly to your skin, so wear light weight baggy clothes. Hiking clothes work well in all seasons in Davis. ;)

**Slow Down**

Slower biking. Slower walking. Slower everything. 

**Drink before you're thirsty**

It's super dry so your sweat is evaporating quickly and you may not notice just how much you're sweating. You need to replenish those fluids. Drink water. Lots.",116,1727908173.0,t3_1fuskfi

1fuskfi,lq5pf58,AnteaterToAggie,"The fabric matters. The breathable weaves (regardless of material) provide your skin with shade from the solar radiation and allow your skin to perspire at the same time. 

Tighter clothes can help cool you by wicking the sweat away from your body and cooling you via evaporation. They may slow the heat effect of solar radiation (as all clothes do), but since they're in direct contact with your skin, they will eventually just pass on all that solar heat to you.

Making friends is tough. I've realized I'm too pushy and overwhelming for a lot of people, you might have the same issue. People really don't like when they become your friends without you becoming theirs, make you seem clingy. Here are some tips that helped me:
1) Make concrete plans with people, don't just say ""we should hang out this weekend"", give them a concrete place/event to look forward to. These vague plans never ever work.
2) Ask them if they're doing anything this weekend and if you can tag along. IMO, finding a friend group that you can join is better than just hanging out with one person since you have a larger pool of people to potentially bond with. Cold approaching is super hard, so natural friendships that develop over time come easier if you see the same person consistently for a longer period of time.
3) There's a great audiobook on youtube called ""how to talk to anyone"", give it a listen, it's very short and packed with great tips on how to be more approachable. If you seem like a fun person to be around, people will naturally come to you. However, if you seem needy and boring, no one will want to hang out with you.

1dd8zfa,l8535mb,Comrade_Corgo,"&gt;The people from UAW did the same thing last year, it's not that far fetched that the encampment people would do the same thing.

That is incorrect. The UAW did *not* form a blockade to block the buses. That was done mainly by Cops Off Campus (a student organization/club), *against* the expressed wishes of the UAW leadership. The UAW wanted and had to be legally compliant while striking in order to hold on to its legal strike protections. This separate organization and a group of those with similar ideological leanings went ahead and broke the law against the UAW's wishes while claiming to support the UAW strike, forcing the UAW to try and distance themselves from the lawbreakers so that the strike wouldn't get broken up by law enforcement. 

The Cops Off Campus people could freely intermingle with the legal strikers just as anyone else could, so if you just made the assumption that UAW was responsible for the blockade because you saw the blockaders mingling with the other types of protestors, then you would be wrong. Now that you know how the UAW strike *actually* went from someone who was there and involved, you can use *your* critical thinking skills when thinking about the *current* protest.",-1,1718125158.0,t1_l8512dn

It is upsetting to see that they are disrupting student exams, that isn't okay, and no one should really say it is okay, because setting up an encampment is also not legal because protests actively go against legality or social acceptance to see demands and progress met.

One of our cats is a neighborhood cat who looks similar to Blue.  We routinely get texts and pics from neighbors of him hanging out in their yard (even their houses).
