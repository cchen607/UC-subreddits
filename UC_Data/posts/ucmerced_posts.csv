,ucmerced,"I think I can provide a unique perspective on how much college costs, given that I kept track of every physical dollar I spent at UC Merced. 

Will list out roughly how much I spent in and around UC Merced per semester (not including tuition, Amazon, and housing)  as well as some details. I hope this will give incoming freshmen a good idea on possible budgeting and guestimates as to how much stuff costs: 


1st semester freshman year: $1520, I took the bus and biked to go outside for food and shopping at Raley’s/Target for groceries and essentials. Also got takeout once or twice a week.  I spent more this semester than my second semester because I opted to get school supplies and a couple of things to spruce up my dorm here and there. This was on top of the campus meal plan. You likely will get tired of eating the food on campus, so buying frozen food or food in town is definitely worth it. Also I think $200 of this might be from adding funds to my paypal, and that was used for mostly non-essentials. 

2nd semester freshman year: $940 Biked around town a lot more compared to taking the bus. Eats up a lot of time so I went out when I had time 1-3x a week. There’s a kitchen in some dorms, so buying ingredients once in a while to experiment college cooking is nice. I cheaped out to a certain extent, like I went out but I tried to stay away from meat when grocery shopping… steak is good, but I didn’t wanna touch raw meat, freaks me out. Eating vegetarian saves a lot of money. Also got hooked on food truck food on campus, would get a $11 order nearly every tuesday from a Chinese food truck. Tastes better than the cafeteria food and had nice people. Meal plan comes with $80+ of CAT dollars, or campus money, you can use it in stores or food trucks on campus, which sorta negates food truck costs to a certain extent. 

3rd semester: sophomore $1760. I moved off campus into an apartment building called Merced Station. At the time, living there was cheaper than dorming on campus. Rent should still be comparable, but you can get an apartment easily 4x bigger than a dorm room with kitchen, fridge, and tv included for roughly the same cost. Had to go grocery shopping a lot more, but roommates who went to costco and split the costs of eggs and stuff helped keep things really cheap ($1760 seems like a lot, but this is without having to pay for a meal plan on campus $2000+ per year)

Any idea why this happens?

My son moved from the dorms to Merced Station this year so I am a little concerned if something is up with Merced Station.

One thing which comes to mind is he toured it in Feb and Merced Station kept bugging him to sign up immediately. He held out till he knew if he got the transfer he was trying for (didnt happen) and signed on finally in April. Merced Station kept pressuring him that rooms wont be available at the 729 rate but they were still available in August for 729.

Are these kids coming online and trying to get someone else to take over the lease in a similar boat? They got pressured by Merced Station to sign leases but then got accepted at their transfer schools?

,ucmerced,"Hi. This is my third semester,  trying to get a degree in ess. Ive been having mental health issues and a mountain of personal failures, and because of that I think my cumulitive gpa this semester is going to be below a 3. I have no job, no extracurriculars, and no relationships with any professors(was too afraid to talk to them for a long time), which means that I won't be able to apply for any summer research or internships this December/January. I have no idea what to do. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get a job in my field if I can't get anything this year. I am trying to get into multiple labs on campus and I am not sure if I'll be allowed in if I have less than a 3.0.

Ive been having mental health issues and a mountain of personal failures, and because of that I think my cumulitive gpa this semester is going to be below a 3. I have no job, no extracurriculars, and no relationships with any professors(was too afraid to talk to them for a long time), which means that I won&amp;#39;t be able to apply for any summer research or internships this December/January. I have no idea what to do. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll ever be able to get a job in my field if I can&amp;#39;t get anything this year.

,ucmerced,"Incoming electrical engineering major here, I realize I need to get my act together.

I know engineering is rigorous. I love engineering regardless. I find electrical engineering utterly fascinating.

...but my study habits aren't all that great. I've suffered with ADHD my whole high school career, and was only recently diagnosed and am finally figuring out which medications work for me.

My mom said that when she went to college (she was an art major I believe at a local community college for reference) she took 9 credits per semester and was fine. She said that the people who took like 14+ credits were in over their heads.

This, has me worried. From my research it seems like engineering majors generally do 15/16+ credits per semester in order to graduate in 4 years.

I know that graduating in 4 years isn't everything, and I know that life happens. But like most people, I would like to graduate in 4 years.

The only AP credit I got in highschool was AP Biology, I wasn't one of the people that did every AP class. I just couldn't take the workload. Granted, I was struggling with ADHD at the time.

I'm currently doing alright in school, I could absolutely do better but I just haven't been able to get myself into high gear, senioritis is probably a big part of it.

If anyone was in my situation, how do I get my act together? How do I make sure I study properly and do it for 4 years? How's UCM in this regard?

I'm really excited for college but I've heard of many people making mistakes in their academic career as freshmen, and despite my desire to not make those same mistakes, I probably will regardless.

,ucmerced,"hello everyone. I am currently in the air force, 19 years old, i have a 4 year contract (Aug 2023-2027). I was born and raised in California but i joined the air force last year right after high school for college and am now stationed in Louisiana. Now my goal is to attend a UC after the air force to pursue and get a bachelors in Meteorology/atmospheric sciences but i would like to attend a CC first and then transfer to UC merced using the tag program, or SJSU, however, I realize that I'm encountering a lot of obstacles in my way. 



1. I can't be eligible for the tag program if i dont attend a cc in California, which is possible for me to apply to and do some classes online like math, english, etc, but not all classes are online because some science classes like chemistry have labs which require you to be physically there. 



2. If i do attend a cc in louisiana, which would be the easiest way to get my ccaf and knock out the requirements to transfer to a uc, i could do all the low div classes required to transfer including the classes that require  you to be there in person, but if i do that, the chance is high that i might not get accepted into a CSU or UC since california universities prefer students that attend cc in california. Or thats who they would rather pick first over me



3. this is not so much of a problem but a solution that i tried to come up on my own. My idea is that i will apply to a cc in California, maybe this upcoming Spring 2025, and i will do every required class i can online from here, and then when my contract with the af is done in mid 2027, i will go back home in California, apply to cc again and knock out the rest of the classes which would be most likely science in person. Hopefully this will take only a semester or 2 at most. After that i will apply to UCs using the tag program.



main goal of this is to knock out cc while im in the air force so i dont have to do 4 years of uni after the air force and i can reduce that to 2 years, since i will have done 2 years of college in the air force. Main goal is to do cc now and try and be eligible for the tag program so i can apply to uc in spring 2028 hypothetically. if UC doesnt work out, then i want to apply to SJSU main questions are is this plan possible to achieve? if this plan doesnt work for UC, will it work for CSUs like SJSU? , if you guys could give me tips and corrections i would apppreciate it VERY MUCH.

,ucmerced,"Hey everyone, I posted something similar like 50 days ago, but as I started my PIQs for fall 2025 applications, i was just curious where I stand, and my chances.

I know UC Merced is considered the lowest selective schools but because of the way I was messing around my freshman and sophomore year, I just want to know if it’s worth me applying or if i should just save the application fee.

As of now, I have a 3.23 UW 3.43 W gpa, but I plan to raise that up since I’m taking 6 dual enrollment courses and 1 AP class this year. I also have 42 community service hours, not a lot but just thought I’d throw that in there. Besides the 6 DE and 1 AP class i’m taking this year, i’ve taken another AP class and 1 college level english class, and a digital art class which gave me articulated credit for community college.

My problem is, I haven’t really been involved with school events like clubs and things like that which I regret but there isn’t much I can do as a senior. Furthermore, 42 hours isn’t that many hours, but i still have time to increase that before I submit my application.

So with that, I am wondering if it’s worth even submitting an application to UCM for Fall 2025 or if i’m likely to get rejected and I should just do CC and transfer somewhere else.

I was admitted to UCM this year and have already submitted my SIR. My award offer was just updated a few days ago, and it's showing me as having $0 in grants at all.

For context, my parents do make a reatively high amount of money, but what's not considered on FAFSA is that they have 3 other siblings to support aside from me - and even with their income cannot afford to pay $43,000 per year on my education out of pocket, meaning that I will have to take out loans to pay off my entire undergraduate education at UCM.

This wouldn't be surprising whatsoever at any other UC, but it's my understanding that UC Merced is typically regarded as being cheaper due to the financial aid available. I am simply wondering if there is anyone else in my current situation, and if there are any other pathways for cheaper tuition at UCM. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

**I scoop the litter box every day at least once**, in the morning when i have time and 100% at night. he's a **very** clean boy. all i ask is **please PLEASE** **don't purposely scare him** or **touch him when i'm away/not in the same room**, and **keep our dorm room door closed when you leave** because he's scared of strangers and noises. I don't want him getting lost by accident. he is **microchipped**!

He will most likely hide when I'm gone, **please don't try to get him out**, he will come out when he feels comfortable/safe.

He has a automatic feeder, and water dispenser, he is very cute but don't give in to your temptation and his cute face and feed him, the vet says he is overweight and needs to go on a diet. he's a year into his diet journey!

I won't have people over and because my cat is a very fearful one so its **best** if you're also okay with not having people over as well.

I'm also fairly sensitive to loud noises so I hope we're able to keep the volume low, I use headphones for everything so you wont hear much noise coming from me, but I do sleep late.

**I stay up late**, studying, doing hw, etc. I sleep around **1-3 am**, I'm also a **light sleeper** so if you also stay up late, we can stay up late together and study.

,ucmerced,"Hello, students of Merced!

My name is Vladimir, and you may recognize me from my [previous post calling for coding enthusiasts to apply for a student developer position on my team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/1dkpltz/calling_all_computer_science_and_coding/). In my previous post, all applicants needed to be able to work legally within the United States. However, this time around, this isn't an employment position but a fellowship with a stipend/award; i.e., it's technically a paid position.

I am a mentor for the Opportunities Fellowship Program (OFP) as my project was selected to be one of the many sponsored projects. This means, if you are interested in working with me but couldn't apply because you didn't meet the requirements, here's your opportunity to work with me! No work authorization needed and this opportunity is open to all undocumented and AB 540 students.

Do you qualify for OFP? From their website...

&gt; To be eligible to receive an OFP fellowship, UC Merced scholars must:
&gt;
&gt; - Be ineligible for federal financial aid.
&gt; - Have an ""AB 540"" exception and CA Dream Act on file.
&gt; - Have an EFC or student aid index equal to or less than the maximum to qualify for a Pell Grant ($6,000).
&gt; - Have sufficient financial need to receive the fellowship.

Not interested in coding? That's fine! The Office of Information Technology (OIT) alone has 8 other technical projects available to pick from. Not technical? There are [**67** projects total in this program](https://ofp.ucmerced.edu/sites/ofp.ucmerced.edu/files/page/documents/final_ofp_projects_list_ay_2024-25.pdf).

This means, if you are interested in working with me but couldn&amp;#39;t apply because you didn&amp;#39;t meet the requirements, here&amp;#39;s your opportunity to work with me! No work authorization needed and this opportunity is open to all undocumented and AB 540 students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you qualify for OFP? From their website...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be eligible to receive an OFP fellowship, UC Merced scholars must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be ineligible for federal financial aid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an &amp;quot;AB 540&amp;quot; exception and CA Dream Act on file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an EFC or student aid index equal to or less than the maximum to qualify for a Pell Grant ($6,000).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have sufficient financial need to receive the fellowship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=""https://ofp.ucmerced.edu/scholars""&gt;https://ofp.ucmerced.edu/scholars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not interested in coding? That&amp;#39;s fine! The Office of Information Technology (OIT) alone has 8 other technical projects available to pick from. Not technical? There are &lt;a href=""https://ofp.ucmerced.edu/sites/ofp.ucmerced.edu/files/page/documents/final_ofp_projects_list_ay_2024-25.pdf""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;67&lt;/strong&gt; projects total in this program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go learn more about the &lt;a href=""https://ofp.ucmerced.edu/""&gt;OFP website&lt;/a&gt; and apply today!&lt;/p&gt;

,ucmerced,"Hello r/ucmerced! My name is Vladimir ([my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allejo) and [my campus directory profile](https://directory.ucmerced.edu/person/vladimirjimenez)), and I am a senior frontend web developer working here at UCM’s IT division. Before joining UC Merced, I worked as a software engineer at Stack Overflow. I am here to announce that I am hiring one student developer on my team. In the long term, I’d like to have a larger team of student developers, but to start this initiative, I’m starting small. I have managed student developers before and have a long history of mentoring individuals entering the tech industry. Here’s what you can learn by working with me:

* Get real-world experience by collaborating on GitHub
* Build accessible web pages to meet ADA compliance
* Build websites using Next.js + React, etc.
* Use REST APIs to build dynamic interfaces
* Automate deployments and other related tasks with CI/CD pipelines
* Work on a remote team (I'm remote)

**Our frontend stack**

* React 16+ (hooks)
* Next.js
* TypeScript (ES6+)
* CSS / Sass / TailwindCSS
* Internal component library

**Requirements**

* Must be legally allowed to work in the United States
* A Computer Science, related major, or previous coding experience
* Sophomore through senior standing
* In good academic standing
* Available to work 10-15 hours per week
* Full-time student at UC Merced
* Familiar with fundamental coding concepts like variables, loops, functions, etc.
* Able to demonstrate good problem solving and critical thinking skills
* Ability or willingness to work with remote teammates
* Eagerness to learn and incorporate constructive feedback from others
* Communication skills with a willingness to ask questions and work on a team

**Bonus Points**

* Experience with CSS, React, JavaScript/TypeScript, or Tailwind CSS
* Experience in other programming languages or frontend frameworks
* Experience with Git / GitHub
* Have an *active* GitHub profile or personal website with code samples/projects
* Experience working on a remote team before

**Tentative Interview Process**

1. A developer will review applications on a rolling basis and contact you via email if we believe you are a good fit for the position
2. An interview with myself and my manager
   1. Some behavioral questions to know how you work on a team and your experience in tech
   2. Some problem-solving skills (no code involved)
   3. If you've submitted code samples or projects as part of your resume/application, we will ask you about them
3. An interview with the development team (myself included)
   1. Questions related to some code snippets
   2. A simple code challenge to gauge your skill level

This process is subject to change.

**Where's the job application?**

There are TWO different applications for the same position. If you know that you qualify for Federal Work Study (FWS), please submit your application through the appropriate job posting. Use the general application if you don't fall under FWS or are unsure.

_General Application_

https://ucmerced.joinhandshake.com/jobs/9084222/share_preview

_Federal Work Study_

https://ucmerced.joinhandshake.com/jobs/9084219/share_preview

There is absolutely NO difference in applications, so please only submit once! Submitting to one application or the other will NOT improve/hurt your chances. The two postings were made solely for statistical purposes of tracking FWS vs non-FWS applicants.

I am NOT accepting resumes via Reddit or any other platforms! I will update this post when the application is officially posted on Handshake.

**Application Close Date:** July 15, 2024

**Who are you hiring?**

We will prioritize students who can work with us for at least two semesters. Freshmen are encouraged to apply if they have some coding experience and can show us some code samples or projects they've worked on.

1. Get approval for a referral by either scheduling an appointment with a UCM physician or possibly by calling and getting a referral over the phone (2nd method has not been verified so YMMV).
2. Follow up to ensure the referral has been sent to Anthem by calling UCM Health Services. The referral DOES NOT appear in your health portal (I have been lied to saying that it will. It has not, to date, been reflected in my health portal). Be sure that the referral was sent before going to step 3.
3. Call your specific provider and inform them that they (the provider) needs to call Anthem and provide them 1) Your Anthem ID Number and 2) The referral code: 8780. Anthem should work with your provider to track down the referral. UCM Insurance and Health Services DOES NOT directly send referrals to your provider.
4. Wait anywhere from 0-35 days for the referral to be processed and any deductibles/co-pays to also be processed. Yes, 35 days is an accurate number due to billing cycles. Referrals are valid for about a year.

,ucmerced,"Hi Everyone!

I have a membership for the aquatics center on the UC Merced campus. I would like to encounter **a professional swimmer - a male student living on campus - to provide me with private swimming lessons to improve my swimming techniques and skills**. 

Likewise, I know how to swim, however, I know that there are many details that I should improve. 

I swim primarily for health reasons. I already asked several lifeguards (students) and they told me that the aquatics center does not offer any private lessons.

However, I wonder if anyone here might be able to give me any idea or recommend anyone about how I can find potential candidates on campus. Please also let me know how much money is reasonable to pay per hour.

This is an opportunity to make an extra income for a student on campus. I am considering one hour or two hours per week, at 06:45 am, on Mondays or Wednesdays. 

I would like to thank you, in advance, for your kind attention and time.
