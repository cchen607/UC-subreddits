To put this another way, it's exactly the same problem we have with healthcare companies and military contractors.

1. It’s $200k for medical programs. 

2. It’s only a cap for federal loans - there’s nothing stopping you from getting a private student loan like millions of people have been doing for decades. 

3. This may actually help fight the ridiculous cost of tuition. If you overlay the cost of tuition against the availability of federal student loans - you’ll see an absolute explosion is tuition costs from the date that federal student loans became available, forward.  


Colleges have been absolutely, hand over fist, screwing students, because they can - and because the federal student loan program has made it extremely simple for students to take out life-altering amounts of debt without a second thought. 

If there’s a cap on debt, then schools will finally have to get their tuition under control or they won’t have any students - and people can go to school again without carrying loans into their 60’s.

\-HPSP scholarship or the NHSC one. its competitive. i dont even want to serve but id do this for free tuition. worth it in long run for me. the HPSP iirc lets u do 2 yrs of tuition for 2 yrs of service. or 3yrs tuition for 3 yrs of service or 4 yrs etc etc. it doesnt have to be all 4 years. but dont quote me on this i havent researched it in a while.   
\-private loans (as low interest as possible)  
\-work after undergrad and build credit ASAP. after a few years of building excellent credit, look into private loans again and see if you get better rates  
\-explore other career options. if i was in this situation and i decided med was not worth it anymore id look into being a PA, dental hygienist, nursing. with PA being my top choice since its 3yrs and cheaper than med school  
\-look into studying abroad. i have no idea how this would work but maybe other countries would offer loans with no cap? look into it.  
\-work for a couple of years and then apply to med schools (put aside as much of your income as possible in high yield savings account to pay for med school). idk how well this would work or how long it would take. this would be last resort imo.

im sorry you're going through this it really sucks. this country is not headed in a good direction. when you have yale professors quitting and moving to canada you start to wonder if the academia we once praised this country for is even worth it anymore. education should not cost this much and it definitely should not be this expensive for those who score excellently in school but come from low income backgrounds. i wish u the best of luck.",1,1751620589.0,t3_1lqz9gz

There's a reason why these political commentators target college students for content.

There are certainly conservative people that mean well, I’m not trying to dehumanize all conservatives, but like genuinely when it comes to the bigotry spewed by the right vs the “moral wrongdoings” of the left, it’s so infuriating how much of it is propaganda induced morality.

1kyp8pe,muz36po,awkotacos,"She has one degree in multiple sciences and another in mathematics. Both received from Crafton Hills College.

&gt;June is the time of the year when most elementary school students get excited about their summer break. But Alisa Perales, who just turned 11 years old this month, will be preparing for her next big step: Going to UC Riverside.

&gt;The girl from San Bernardino already made history in her Inland Empire community as she became the youngest person to graduate from Crafton Hills College, a community college in Yucaipa, with a degree in multiple sciences and another in mathematics.

&gt;The college said she would have earned two more associate degrees, in physics and computer science, if she stayed for one more semester.

&gt;Instead, Allisa will be pursuing her bachelor’s degree in computer science at UC Riverside in September.

&gt;“It’s a big moment,” the whiz kid said. “I’m ready to move onto a new school and meet new friends.”

&gt;Sending her off to a four- year college is also a rewarding outcome for her father, Raphael Perales, who spotted her love of learning at an early age.

&gt;After mastering basic ABCs and 123s by her first birthday, Alisa was ready to expand her knowledge, so her father homeschooled her until when it became the time for Alisa to start Crafton Hills College at age 8.

&gt;“She’s been different her whole life, but I have always taught her that there’s nothing out there she’s not capable of understanding,” the father told the community college before the graduation.

&gt;Raphael insisted that he did not set out a rigorous schedule or goal for the young girl. Rather, he said he simply followed her lead as the girl’s thirst for knowledge and interest in school grew.

&gt;“I responded to what she was interested in and helped feed that interest and fueled that fire,” the proud father said.

Edit: Just to be clear, “failed genius” doesn’t mean they aren’t successful—it just means they didn’t live up to what the world expected from them. A lot of geniuses end up becoming teachers or pursuing something they’re passionate about, rather than chasing what’s considered a ‘higher’ achievement.

It's a great achievement but these stories are really just hyping up getting a degree as early as possible (way too early), which imo is a disservice to both someone as young as her and devalues the college experience. Going to college is more than just getting some paper degree, it's about getting an experience in multiple facets. It's about classes, meeting people and taking advantage of experiences and opportunities. At 11 can she even take advantage of internships? I know in California teens can't work until like 16 and even then need like permission from parents and school. My brother when trying to get a job in high school couldn't land one, and it took the combo of Covid + a local restaurant getting desperate for workers to hire him on in the back kitchen. She's also pretty much not gonna have dating life. Also if she does make friends, a lot of those older friends/classmates are not gonna be comfortable sharing more adult topics with someone who isn't even 13 yet.

I continued doing the highest level of every program up until I went to high school and got into [scholars academy ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholars_Academy) often recognized as south Carolina #1 educational program

When i went to UC Santa Cruz in 2012 I went to Merrill college. We were in a big auditorium with all the incoming freshman. The guidance counselor asked us to raise our hand with who came in with 5 transfered credits. 10, etc etc. We kept going. I had my hand up until 100. I took 9 AP courses and 11 college classes throughout high school. I was the equivalent of a junior at 18, I could have graduated that year if I played my cards right. She had worked there for 30 years and not a single student had ever come in with more than 50. So I'm not average

And guess what? The honors schooling system failed me and failed most people I know. We're all just average workers. And most of us burned out. What ever happened to the articles of these same ""kid geniuses"" from the 2000? The kids who were my age? Nothing. Nothing ever happens with these kids. 

This entire ""omg my kid graduated at 11"" is misguided and abuse of what education and maturation of a human being should accomplish. Rushing someone into that position and putting their mind on a pedestal will lead to nothing but burnout and failure. This shit is stupid. As someone who was essentially one of these kids.

1kyp8pe,mv05xri,ChikenCherryCola,"IQ is bullshit though. Its better at measuring how close you were born to Europe or america and how much money your parents made when you were a kid than it is at measuring your intelligence.

The other thing is autism isn't a super power and you're not like helping people with autism by suggesting that is is.

The thing about learning and education is you really just need to know how to read and write and the will to put in the work, but anyone can learn anything. Like we sort of act like only smart people can major in math or physics or engineering, and like that's bullshit. Most math and engineering students couldn't complete a philosophy pr literature major and the reason isn't lack of intelligence, it's lack of desire to read like 1000 pages per week of old ass books. Similarly most majors couldn't finish a chemistry degree mostly because they just don't have the will do the math and stuff. Any grad student will tell you though, once you've completed one program, you realize you could probably do any other if you had the desire to put in the work on a subject. Really this is mainly what the k-12 system sort of sets kids up to do, you're just learning how to learn and sort of doing reps go build stamina. Its not implausible for a child to sort of reach this point much earlier earlier than age 17 or 18, the k-12 system is meant to educate all the kids together at the same time which can be somewhat inefficient and inconvenient for specific individuals, but that's not like an IQ thing. Some kids, poor kids usually, have a hard time focusing all of their life on school when they have to grapple with a more harsh reality that wealthier ones.

What's surely impressive about this girl is her very early infant development. Baby humans have this weird thing where we're born like partially developed mainly in the brain department. Most animals are born with the ability to walk and feed themselves, humans are born kind of at this medium of the maximum size of a skull that a mother's birth canal can facilitate, but a baby is still at a level of development that in most other animals would still be in utero. You're first like 36 months are really like kind of intense brain development to be happening outside of a womb or an egg, we're talking developing the cognition like object permanence a full year after having been born. Some how this girl had already allegedly mastered the ABCs by 12 months when normally a baby shouldn't have the capacity for speech beyond mama and dada at that point. That's not a point of intelligence, that's a point of why does your 12 month old have the developed brain of a 3 year old. At any rate, if sounds like she was able to effectively start kindergarten at age 3 or 4 instead of 5 or 6 and she did it with a home school program, which anyone whos taken one will tell you can blast through a GED equivalent in just a few years if you can read and write English effectively. Blasting through k-12 education in 4-6 years is basically what students at the remedial schools to (the like you got kicked out of normal high school so now you're in last chance school to still get a high school diploma by age 17-19 even though your starting at like age 14-17. Its wild that this girl was able to start doing this at age 3 or 4, but given that she was it's plenty plausible for her to be in college.

Unfortunately people will say oh it’s what the kids says they want to do, which may be true, but often times could say that because they want to make their parents happy. I mean look at a lot of the childhood actors now, they expressed this as well. I’m not saying it’s a good or a bad thing, but it definitely does come with some negatives. 
A famous case of this actually is the Unabomber weirdly enough he went to college at a young age and expressed feeling very isolated from his peers and ended up seeking validation from some bad actors.

I know a few prodigies who think they’re the smartest people in the world and have zero social skills. I also know some prodigy who caught up on those social skills later and are doing amazing. Really depends on the situation. As a MIT graduate, I’ve seen it go both ways.

There isn't an ideal situation for kids like that.",1,1748838111.0,t1_mvi50gm
1kyp8pe,mvjm3rw,nyquil-fiend,"I’m not informed in the research. I also don’t think holding them back from pursuing advanced education early is good either. However I think there’s a tenancy for bright, intellectual kids—and this applies to many MIT students (including myself) not just the prodigies—to over-emphasize the intellect, become hyper, rational, and apply logic to everything. (I’m talking about people interested in math and science specifically, as with this girl.) 

When one’s identity hinges on being highly intellectual, it’s a huge hit to the ego when one discovers that they are not developed in other areas of life. A common response is just to double down on the intellectualizing. What we end up with is an academic system filled with professors who think they’re the smartest people in the world, but really only know how to think and not relate to people and thus actually miss out on most of the world. I think doing good science relies on being a balanced person who can understand that reality isn’t just the intellect or the physical or the measurable. There’s definitely a difference between knowledge and wisdom. 

We have too many very knowledgeable experts with no wisdom it seems. Just look at what humans have done with technology in the past 50 or 100 years; as a species we race into technologies we aren’t wise enough to use well. Isn’t it interesting how new technology is always used by the military first? Nuke, autonomous drones, GPS… At this point I’m ranting a bit. 

Obviously, plenty if not, most people end up branching out. But if you look at the professors who occupy top seats and academia, you’ll find the type of people I’m talking about. Ultimately many intellectual people end up being very self-serving and that they are just studying things that they’re interested in, which is great, but so much effort and resources are put into things which are contributing to warfare or don’t matter at all. Why not really try to grow as a society? I hate to see genius distorted by an ill society instead of geniuses healing society and removing said distortion.

There isn’t an ideal situation for children like that. But then again there’s hardly ever an ideal situation for anybody. Certainly we can do better than allowing an 11-year-old to pursue one college degree after another. The intellect is clearly already hyper developed, take advantage of a young plastic brain to develop other areas to make a more balanced human. Of course, the path of least resistance for her is to continue being praised for her success and continue an academia. I’m just doubtful that route will be the most elucidating for her self discovery in the long run.

What’s the solution? I’m not sure but I think it’s integral education. We need to develop the mind, body and spirit of an individual and not just their mind. The ecosystem of academia is not conducive to that in its current state, but it can be if we change it. As for this 11-year-old right now? I think she has enough degrees and college experience already.",1,1748844309.0,t1_mvj9z8g

1khe0zq,mrrspvi,WashNo8368,"Oh princess
You really thought you had an independent thought there, didn't you?  

The paradox of tolerance, as outlined by Karl Popper, can be applied to the behavior of some liberal college students who suppress ideas opposing their own, drawing a parallel to the authoritarian tactics of groups like the Brownshirts in Nazi Germany. Popper argued that unbounded tolerance can enable intolerant ideologies to flourish, ultimately destroying the tolerant society that permits them. However, the paradox also implies that tolerance must be defended by resisting intolerance, which creates a tension when considering free speech and the exchange of ideas.
When liberal college students shout down, cancel, or prevent speakers with opposing views (e.g., conservative, controversial, or traditionalist perspectives) from expressing their ideas, they may justify their actions as defending tolerance—claiming they are protecting marginalized groups or combating harmful ideologies. However, this can mirror the intolerance they oppose. By stifling open discourse and silencing dissent, they risk embodying the very authoritarianism they claim to resist, akin to how the Brownshirts used violence and intimidation to suppress political opponents in Weimar Germany. The Brownshirts didn’t engage in debate; they shut it down through force and fear, undermining the democratic exchange of ideas.
The paradox here is that while these students may believe they are upholding tolerance by rejecting ""intolerant"" ideas, their methods can erode the principles of free speech and open inquiry that are foundational to a tolerant society. If they deem certain ideas too dangerous to be heard, they assume the role of arbiters of acceptable speech, which can slide into dogmatic control over discourse. This parallels the Brownshirts’ tactics, not in scale or violence but in the impulse to eliminate rather than engage with opposing views.
Popper’s solution to the paradox suggests that a tolerant society should tolerate all views except those that actively seek to destroy tolerance itself (e.g., ideologies advocating violence or oppression). However, this boundary is tricky in practice. Many of the ideas suppressed on campuses—such as debates on immigration, gender, or cultural values—do not inherently advocate harm but are labeled as such to justify censorship. This overreach risks creating an environment where only one worldview is permitted, undermining the diversity of thought that universities are meant to foster.
In short, when liberal college students block the free flow of opposing ideas, they may inadvertently embody the intolerance they claim to fight against, echoing the Brownshirts’ suppression of dissent. The paradox of tolerance warns that true tolerance requires defending open discourse, even for ideas one finds objectionable, unless those ideas directly threaten the foundations of a free society. Failing to do so risks replacing one form of dogma with another.",1,1746981284.0,t1_mrrphef

1khe0zq,mrahhuc,WashNo8368,"The paradox of tolerance, as outlined by Karl Popper, can be applied to the behavior of some liberal college students who suppress ideas opposing their own, drawing a parallel to the authoritarian tactics of groups like the Brownshirts in Nazi Germany. Popper argued that unbounded tolerance can enable intolerant ideologies to flourish, ultimately destroying the tolerant society that permits them. However, the paradox also implies that tolerance must be defended by resisting intolerance, which creates a tension when considering free speech and the exchange of ideas.
When liberal college students shout down, cancel, or prevent speakers with opposing views (e.g., conservative, controversial, or traditionalist perspectives) from expressing their ideas, they may justify their actions as defending tolerance—claiming they are protecting marginalized groups or combating harmful ideologies. However, this can mirror the intolerance they oppose. By stifling open discourse and silencing dissent, they risk embodying the very authoritarianism they claim to resist, akin to how the Brownshirts used violence and intimidation to suppress political opponents in Weimar Germany. The Brownshirts didn’t engage in debate; they shut it down through force and fear, undermining the democratic exchange of ideas.
The paradox here is that while these students may believe they are upholding tolerance by rejecting ""intolerant"" ideas, their methods can erode the principles of free speech and open inquiry that are foundational to a tolerant society. If they deem certain ideas too dangerous to be heard, they assume the role of arbiters of acceptable speech, which can slide into dogmatic control over discourse. This parallels the Brownshirts’ tactics, not in scale or violence but in the impulse to eliminate rather than engage with opposing views.
Popper’s solution to the paradox suggests that a tolerant society should tolerate all views except those that actively seek to destroy tolerance itself (e.g., ideologies advocating violence or oppression). However, this boundary is tricky in practice. Many of the ideas suppressed on campuses—such as debates on immigration, gender, or cultural values—do not inherently advocate harm but are labeled as such to justify censorship. This overreach risks creating an environment where only one worldview is permitted, undermining the diversity of thought that universities are meant to foster.
In short, when liberal college students block the free flow of opposing ideas, they may inadvertently embody the intolerance they claim to fight against, echoing the Brownshirts’ suppression of dissent. The paradox of tolerance warns that true tolerance requires defending open discourse, even for ideas one finds objectionable, unless those ideas directly threaten the foundations of a free society. Failing to do so risks replacing one form of dogma with another.",0,1746729778.0,t1_mra5b53
1khe0zq,mx29xsa,Nicola_S_Mangione,"God, you're so close to understanding why you're wrong. Keep going ol' timer. Truly, if you keep reading, you might \*comprehend\* the paradox, instead of just browsing it.

The ideologies in question are not equal. The right (largely) \*is\* advocating for the destruction of tolerance. That is the difference.   
  
The opposition is just trying to exist.",1,1749580458.0,t1_mrahhuc
1khe0zq,mxua3eb,WashNo8368,"your rebuttal mischaracterizes the original argument and hinges on rhetorical flaws that undermine its credibility. The post highlighted the paradox of tolerance—articulated by Karl Popper—as a principle suggesting tolerance must defend open discourse unless ideas threaten a free society, using the historical analogy of Brownshirts to caution against dogmatic suppression. Your response, rather than engaging this nuance, pivots to an unsubstantiated claim that the ""right (largely) is* advocating for the destruction of tolerance,"" a sweeping generalization lacking evidence from the text or context. This ad hominem shift, paired with the condescending ""God, you’re so close"" and the vague ""keep reading"" directive, dodges substantive debate, relying instead on emotional appeal and assumed superiority.
Your assertion that the ideologies in question are unequal, with the right inherently intolerant, ignores the post’s point: both sides can fall into intolerance if they block discourse. The claim that ""the opposition is just trying to exist"" oversimplifies the issue, framing one side as inherently virtuous without addressing their actions—e.g., the violence implied in the SF State context—which the original post critiques. This selective framing is a strawman fallacy, misrepresenting the argument as a defense of fascism rather than a call for consistent tolerance.
The paradox of tolerance doesn’t judge ideologies’ inherent merit but warns of the risk of replacing one dogma with another. Your rebuttal fails to refute this, instead injecting bias and avoiding the core issue of balancing free expression with societal defense. A more rigorous response would engage the paradox directly, not dismiss it with rhetoric.",1,1749952326.0,t1_mx29xsa

""embarrassing yourselves by canceling him"" could be a multitude of different accusations and critiques with variable sensibility. to believe kirk is acting more civil than who he's debating appears to implicate that kirk has better posturing and conviction. rather than kirk isn't using disingenuous debate tactics on a selective group of people who aren't as prepared to counteract it. i want to explain why i think it appears this way; as i can give an example in the case of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia.

kirk does not begin the debate to acknowledge the immigration law for due process, or the requirements for asylum and withholding of removal. instead, he emphasizes the accused character and labeling of Abrego Garcia. even using the crowd to further gain validation and attempt to delegitimize the person he is debating. he uses these accusations without acknowledging that the origins for him being MS-13 come from an informant in a different state, which was never cross-examined. along with suspicion about his clothes attire and his proximity to MS-13 members while he was looking for work at a Home Depot in 2019. certainly it is proof that he is MS-13 because two immigration judges that overlooked his bond hearings denied his bail due to a much looser consideration of presented evidence, including hearsay. and that despite all of this he still was allowed a withholding of removal, as not only was it not found that the evidence of being MS-13 sufficent to rule on; the hearing for his withholding required tighter consideration from the judge. who found his story sufficient. of course kirk will not acknowledge this, as throughout the whole debate, he has convicted Abrego Garcia is MS-13 and does everything to keep it that way, all so he can justify that his deportation was a good thing. and that due process doesn't mean that the government needed to go to a judge to present a case why Abrego Garcia should get his witholding of removal revoked.

this is what i mean when something is disingenuous, and why it isn't a constructive experience to interact with him.",2,1747074271.0,t1_mrwg8gk

Now, it is one of the most competitive schools to get into in the United States alone. I am willing to bet that UCR is going to follow the same path; it is already top 1.3% of universities worldwide and opened as a college campus less than 100 years ago.

The message was, if you can’t handle it, get out because there’s someone behind you to take your place. No doubt Berkeley is a great school &amp; I loved my time there but nobody talks about the parts that not so great. There was no handholding &amp; LONG lines to talk to financial aid &amp; counselors. We were mostly taught by grad students &amp; that is where the focus and attention went. Many intro classes were taught in Wheeler auditorium which seats 700+ and more students were on the floor. The city of Berkeley is dirty, lots of homeless people with trash in the streets and plenty of religious cults that target students on campus. Housing is a struggle. I say all this bc everyone romanticizes Berkeley but you really need to be thick skinned and it is not the school for everyone. During my time we had  a few people commit suicide bc they received a low grade or failed a class… the pressure was intense back then and I suspect more so now.

Riverside as a city is also a complete dump, especially the area directly surrounding the college and downtown. I would also say the quality of the education is middling. The weather is horrid, the summers are unbearably hot at 110+ degrees a lot of the time, it has some of the worst air quality in the country (I know, I was part of a research project tracking it and wrote papers on the issue), and it is downright dirty, with graffiti and trash everywhere. It's also boring. The only thing to do in Riverside is drive away from Riverside to LA, SD, etc. I lived there for 3 years while I finished my Computer Engineering degree and moved to Seattle (which also has its problems) the month after I graduated. I am infinitely happier here. It's cool and all that your perspective is different and if you enjoy your time at UCR, I think that's great. You shouldn't ignore real problems with the school and area and shut down discussion about it though.

The president at RCC is from Sacramento and refuses to live in the city. During meetings on campus, she would try to get us to conspire with the police against the city's most vulnerable. Weirdos from out of state come to school board meetings to harass queer children.

1k0ckv0,mne00ok,BLINKONCEGV,"No, let people voice their opinion. UCR is an awful school. The education is a joke. So many professors don't care and read off the slides word for word with no energy or enthusiasm. Literally, UCR feels like a horrible community college. Out of my two years here, I can maybe name like 3 professors who were actually great and taught classes in a way that was beneficial. 

On top of that, the city is horrendous, and there's literally no opportunities. Don't believe me? Go speak to a career counselor and see how it goes. I just did, and all she did was give me a tutorial on how to use handshake. Im 4th year and I'm about to graduate... Of course I know how to use handshake, but she had to waste the time somehow since she had nothing of value to share. 

Lastly, so many people here are beyond rude and unfriendly. The biggest lie I heard about UCR was that people are ""so nice and down to earth."" That's a blatant lie that people say because they can't compliment UCR on any of the important features (academics, professional development, etc.) Honestly, the amount of people that will have attitude when u just met them is so shocking. Clubs are so unwelcoming also. They feel like you're intruding in an already established friend group that has no desire to welcome new people. The only time people are ""nice"" are when you have a class with them and they want to use you for answers on hw assignments. 

It's objectively true that all of the other UCs (apart from maybe UCSC) are better than UCR in every single way and it's not even close. Don't be mad at people who actually wanted a strong college education, robust opportunities, and a welcoming campus and social life for voicing their opinions. UCR will never improve if people like you just shut valid criticisms down and spew objectively false nonsense at how amazing UCR is. Look up average incomes among the UC alumini, you can sort the data by school and see that UCR is one of the worst.

I can go on. But the point stands that UCR is horrendous and its horrible reputation is deserved. Before I came here, I actually had a friend who graduated from her and I asked her for some advice, she warned me not to come here. I didn't listen and thought she was being dramatic, I was even ready to prove her wrong. But wow, I really should've listened to her.

UCR professors sometimes DO read off the slides, but so do the ones at UCLA, UCB, UCSC, literally any other university. Professors will always have their specific teaching ways REGARDLESS of where you decide to go. 
Riverside does lack opportunities within its perimeters, but you act like Uber/Lyft aren’t options, Zip-cars on campus you can use, on top of the already INCLUDED in your tuition RTA program. You can literally bus your way partially to most of those opportunities. 
And to the very end, you will NEVER find a campus that doesn’t include rude people on it. Living, walking nightmares exist on every campus, as well as select clubs that are genuinely large friend groups. This just tells that YOU didn’t use your two years to explore other welcoming groups OR programs that are absolutely amazing and kind to students. There are literal groups dedicated for transfer students. You didn’t bother using the one UCR website that has it all together????

Also, mind that UCR quite literally started as a UCB funded research facility. Eventually, once the school was actually established, a lot of its UCB funding was cut. It grew, and COVID cut that down further. Even then, we have PLENTY of programs and resources to help out students. You just didn’t make use of any of them.",4,1744825247.0,t1_mne00ok
1k0ckv0,mnh2w5h,BLINKONCEGV,"There are so many dumb points in this post that it's sad to even read.

First of all, if you did basic math, you would've realized that I'm literally a transfer student, hence why I did 2 years here, but I'm a 4th year student. So, transferring to another school was not a viable option for me.

Yes, bad professors exist at ALL schools, i never once denied this. But other schools, especially other UCs, make up for it with strong reputations, a wide range of available opportunities, and strong connections with companies/organizations for recruitment. UCR fails in these areas as well, which is why it's such an awful school. 

Bus my way to where? San Bernardino? LOL that's probably worse than Riveraide. Be serious. Unless you're bussing like 2-3 hours out, you're not getting to any good opportunities. Basic logistics proves you wrong here. 

I joined many clubs and quickly realized a pattern at UCR. I also engaged with the transfer events when I first got here. You're literally making assumptions with no basis. UCR is not this friendly environment you're trying to make it out to be. The people are, in general, very rude and unwelcoming. You saying I just didn't ""do enough"" to find the friendly people proves that. 

Did you even read my post? You're saying i didn't ""make use of the programs and resources"" when I attended multiple career events and information sessions and spoke to multiple career/internship counselors during my time here. I literally said in my post that I had just had a meeting with a career counselor from the career center... and it was a waste of time. I've given this school plenty of opportunities to prove me wrong, but it has failed every time.

Anyways, it's clear you're just blindly defending UCR. All of your points just prove mine that it's an awful school and in a dead city. Your main defense is ""the other UCs also have this issue,"" yet you fail to realize that the others UCs make up for it, UCR does not.",-5,1744836593.0,t1_mng0v4o
1k0ckv0,mnh4tku,Cheap_Translator2011,"1) Yes. Anyone can do the simple math, but if YOU had actual literacy, you’d see I emphasized transfer programs because I’m a transfer too. You are not a unique situation, because YOU are not unique. You are one in thousands going to this school as a transfer. And yes, transferring AGAIN is viable because many transfers HERE will also transfer elsewhere. Don’t blame the university for your lack of willpower to transfer again. 
2) Again, your lack of willpower is bringing you nowhere. In the ONE month I worked a campus job, I got two recommendations from the Financial Aid Office Faculty for one permanent position there, and a second one elsewhere in Riverside. UCR has these opportunities that YOU aren’t looking for. 
3) Yes, bussing your way works. Not fast enough? Get a bike or use a Zipcar which, again, is another resource that YOU have access to. I got to work in DTR as a part of the university, which is only 2 miles. What, you somehow can’t bus the two miles? Excuse after excuse. 
4) If EVERY single person you’ve met is somehow a rude, unsociable groupie… maybe YOU are the problem? Because I’ve met the absolute despicable of the bunch, and I’ve also met the kindest, honest, most helpful classmates and club members. 

I’m not blindly defending anything. It just seems like YOUR lack of willpower is something you like to blame onto your fellow peers, bringing them down with you.",4,1744837168.0,t1_mnh2w5h
1k0ckv0,mnh8qfy,BLINKONCEGV,"Lol, you're so mad and delusional it's funny. Willpower to transfer out? Why would I transfer out as a student with senior standing, potentially delaying my graduation, increasing costs, etc? That would be a very dumb decision, I'll leave those to you since it clearly fits your character.

I also worked on an on-campus job. You're not special, and you haven't done anything I didn't do. UCR has opportunities, sure, that was never my point. My point is that the opportunities fail in comparison to the other UCs. AGAIN, go back to my original post and look at the link I posted from the University of California itself. You can lie all you want about how amazing UCR is, but the numbers don't lie, and they are not on your side.

Im not making excuses, I'm saying the opportunities here are NOT worth bussing to. Im from LA, and I constantly throughout my time in CC. I had a job my second year that required me to bus for 2 hours, I did it because it was worth it. UCR has low quality opportunities, even compared to my CC. If you wanna bus 2 hours for some unpaid internship at an unknown low quality firm, then be my guest. Unlike you, high-acheiving students here actually want ROBUST opportunities and are struggling to find them here. 

Ah yes... people being closed off for no reason and rude makes me the problem, amazing deflection. At CC, I had absolutely no trouble making friends. Im even still close with many of the amazing ppl I met at CC. What's more, CCs have worse reputations in terms of social life, but my CC was much more friendly and welcoming compared to UCR. Honestly, judging by the way you responded to my first post, you're probably just one of the rude and snippy people at UCR. 

Lastly, yes, i had a lack of willpower to attempt to transfer to another school as a senior standing student because that would be a beyond stupid thing to do. Keep in mind that I did not blame my ""fellow peers"" for the downsides of UCR. Most of my criticisms are aimed at the quality of the school and its location. I only mentioned peers to debunk a myth that UCR is a supportive and welcoming place. You speak about literacy but couldn't comprehend this basic point. How sad.",1,1744838370.0,t1_mnh4tku
1k0ckv0,mngwez2,BLINKONCEGV,"The people trying to defend UCR are funny. Telling me to ""transfer out"" when I literally transferred in and I said I'm a 4th year lol. Also, defending UCR by saying ""All the others UCs have these problems too"" is weak at best. Even if that was true, it proves that UCR sucks as the the other schools make up for it with robust opportunities, strong reputations, and more desirable locations. 

""UCR does have a lot of opportunities"" is an incredibly laughable statement. The only decent opportunities available here are the ones you can get at any other UC. UCR has nothing special to offer. My major literally has an internship requirement, and so many students struggled to find anything because UCR is an opportunity dead zone. You are trying to say UCR has the same opportunities as UCLA, UCSD, UCI etc.? Basic data on the economic situations of these cities will tell you this is not true. Also, compare the companies/organizations that go to career fairs and recruit at the different UCs... it's a night and day difference and UCR gets the short-end of the stick.

Anyways, it's interesting I received so many downvotes when I based my criticisms on objective measures, and I even linked a source. Meanwhile, people who replied to me praising UCR with no sources, objective measures, or anything like that get up voted. Saying ""other UCs have this problem"" isn't proving anything.

Just claiming he is a grifter is not sufficient. Like I said, I disagree with some of his stances, but he attempts to politely engage with those who have differing viewpoints and are coming at him in good faith. Those are productive discussions. I can understand his viewpoint, even if I disagree.

That is a very valuable thing. The reason it scares so many is because a good chunk of the left wing relies on echo chambers and silencing their opponents to multiply. Opening up dialogue with their opponents is bad for them because they want to make those who disagree with them out to be some malevolent force in our society. Charlie Kirk is bringing these opportunities to hear the opposing side straight to the places that want to silence him for the purpose of recruitment. While he has made money doing so, there is absolutely no denying he has helped create a cultural swing in the youth vote. 
He’s not out here lying to people. He’s not selling them something that is bogus. He’s found an opportunity to make money while helping his cause, and sharing differing viewpoints. What about that makes him a grifter?",-6,1746828177.0,t1_mrh68mb

He benefits financially, sure. But isn’t that kind of the goal for anyone? To make a good living doing something you love that also benefits what you believe to be a good cause? I can guarantee you, if the leftwing people that approached him all had civil debates and there was no crazy person to highlight in a video, he would still be fulfilling his goal. But at this point in the “culture war,” a big part of that is highlighting the craziness of a niche group that attempts to silence opposition.

He also willingly speaks with any person that shows up, including professors and other members of the local community. He has conversed with the governor of California, and taken part in debates with highly educated individuals.

He runs an organization whose main focus is helping guide college/high school students toward the conservative viewpoint. Engaging with any willing participant on college campuses seems to align very well with that goal. 
Regardless, college kids are voters, and are heavily political. Why should he avoid giving these people the opportunity to either debate or discuss various topics with him.

1) Examples of “this” included virtually every as you will ever get from TPUSA. Sure, he might occasionally post a clip of someone making a good point against him on Twitter, but overwhelmingly the content put out by TPUSA is clips of anything that makes college students look dumb.

2) yes, he does debates with educated individuals who know how to debate like Destiny and Vaush…and usually ends up looking less impressive in those.

3) No one is saying he can’t come to campuses and do his routine. People are saying just ignore him because you either already agree with him or you’ll just be feeding him content. From the point of view of many on this campus there isn’t any point to engaging with him because these aren’t debates about relevant issues. They’re media events to farm content. If you don’t believe this, I will refer you to point 1.

4) No, no he isn’t. He puts on a veneer of politeness but his approach is confrontational and combative. If he was acting in good faith he could listen, give an explanation, and then listen politely to a response, but he doesn’t do that. He cuts people off, asks ad hominem questions, and is overall just not engaged in actually explaining anything because his entire belief system is inherently contradictory.",5,1746851851.0,t1_mrhsfy7

Yes you're right about that! The people who were up there speaking weren't the brightest. Unfortunately, A.) the same people who fall for the trap are usually not the left's smartest. That is the reality of any group and to characterize an entire group off of a small sample size comes with all of the fallacies of generalization. B.)

Graduating from Westview High School in the Torrey Highlands community of San Diego in 2006,[46][47] Holmes attended the University of California, Riverside (UCR). In 2010, he received his undergraduate B.S. degree in neuroscience with highest honors.[48][49][50][51] He was a member of several honor societies, including Phi Beta Kappa and Golden Key.[52] According to UCR recommendation letters submitted to the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), Holmes graduated in the top 1 percent of his class with a 3.949 GPA. The UCR letters also described Holmes as “a very effective group leader” and a person who “takes an active role in his education, and brings a great amount of intellectual and emotional maturity into the classroom”.[53] Holmes scored in the 98th percentile on the verbal portion, the 94th percentile on the quantitative portion and the 45th percentile on the analytical writing portion of the Graduate Record Examinations.[54]",9,1734856075.0,t1_m37i0uj

There has been a letter written describing the undisclosed events which surrounded her murder, and a desk which had an eerie poem written beneath it eluding to murder. The desk was discovered in an RCC warehouse and the letter was confirmed to be fake, written by the same person identified through DNA. The inscription written into the desk is written similarly to the Zodiac Killer’s letters, but it’s still unproven if there’s a connection and the Riverside police department/cold case unit believe they know who killed her, although there is insufficient evidence to charge them or place an arrest.

However:

&gt;*In addition, the RPD have noted similarities between Bates’ murder and the general modus operandi of a fatal attack upon a young couple committed at Lake Berryessa in September 1969—an attack conclusively ascribed to the Zodiac.*

When you do turn 21, getting a concealed carry permit in riverside is incredibly fast relative to other counties. This will allow you to carry a loaded pistol in your car.

A carry permit technically allows you to have a weapon on you in the majority of public spaces but it’s a hassle so I would suggest only doing so if you are exiting your comfort zone, such as visiting a city far away from home or cashing a check at a sketchy bank.",4,1755359999.0,t3_1mrehab

A conceal carry permit is a county thing, if you cross into another county you will catch a charge which can range from fine to losing your right to vote (ehem felony). For certain states  it's an instant felony and jail time/legal fees/costly probation.

Guns should not replace using your brain. If you're going to a bank, don't go in the ghetto. If you have to go in the ghetto, go inside and don't park in front of the bank. If you feel something sketchy somewhere, leave the area. Find people you're comfortable to be around.

1lr4yh9,n239vdb,Shepathustra,"&gt;Yes, all the Palestinians need to do is roll over and die and this can all be over, why didn’t the Palestinians think of that sooner?

They did. In Jordan and in West Bank.

&gt;Never mind that 82% of Israelis want to ethnically cleanse and annex all of Gaza.  

What percentage of Americans were down for the war the day after 9/11?

&gt;Never mind that 42% want to eradicate every man, woman, and child.

This is absolute bullshit and classic Jew hating blood libel. But let’s talk about anti Jewish sentiment in your family and across the entire Arab world. Let’s talk about the anti Jewish sentiment baked into Christianity and Islam since in order for those religions to even exist their story needs to start with how Jews were bad and so god changed his mind.

&gt;Never mind that Palestinians are not allowed to have a military and they live next to a well armed genocidal terror state.

Palestinians have a strong military in Jordan, which is part of the region known as Palestine and majority Palestinian. 

&gt;Nah, they should just roll over and let the Israelis commit their genocide.

In 1949 there were 60,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Now there are 2 million. There are more Arab Palestinians living in the region now than ever before in history. Jews in Israel are allowed to convert to Islam. Arabic is for all practical purposes an official language. 20% of Israel’s population is Palestinian with full civil rights.

Meanwhile, in the Arab world apostasy is a capital crime, honor killings are rampant, there is literal African slave trade as well as kefala legalized servitude. Hundreds of languages cultures and religions erased and lost in exchange for Arabic and Islam. And you call Jews the genocidal ones.

There are currently still 2 million less Jews in the world than in 1939 but I guess you’re happy about that. If only we would all just roll over and die there would be peace throughout the Middle East and Europe.

Maybe my family and I should just move back to Iran right? We’ll be REAL safe there. Except for that time they forced my entire community to convert to Islam in Mashhad and we all had to larp around as religious Muslims to avoid being killed. But hey look at these genocidal Israelis with their lack of death penalty and their freedom of religion.

Can you believe how these savages treat Palestinians? I heard last year more than 50% of Israeli medical school grads were Arabs. Such apartheid. Such genocide.

Yes, all the Palestinians need to do is roll over and die and this can all be over, why didn’t the Palestinians think of that sooner?

Never mind that 82% of Israelis want to ethnically cleanse and annex all of Gaza.  Never mind that 42% want to eradicate every man, woman, and child.

Subject: Protect the R’Garden – A Vital Educational and Community Resource

Dear Dean Atkinson,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Full Name], and I am a student at UC Riverside writing to express my concern about the potential closure of the R’Garden. I strongly urge you to support the continuation of this essential space that has served as a living classroom, sustainability hub, and vital resource for both students and the broader community.

The R’Garden is far more than just a garden — it’s a place where students engage with real-world issues like food insecurity, environmental justice, and sustainable agriculture. It has provided countless students with experiential learning opportunities, research platforms, and service-based projects that directly connect to UCR’s mission of community engagement and academic excellence.

Beyond academics, the R’Garden fosters a deep sense of connection — to the land, to local food systems, and to one another. It’s one of the few places on campus where students can learn about sustainability in action, contribute to local food access efforts, and feel empowered to make a difference.

Shutting down the R’Garden would mean losing a space that embodies the values of equity, environmental responsibility, and community partnership that UCR proudly upholds. I ask that you stand with students and ensure that the R’Garden remains protected and supported.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]

I wasn't able to find ANY sources outside of biased and uncredible reports displaying anything at all related to an excessive increase in human trafficking at the border under Biden, and didn't see anything even among those spewing a 400% increase. What I did find was this: Bidens border policy wasnt pro child trafficking, and a break down as to what his policy actually was: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jun/20/donald-trump/president-joe-bidens-border-policy-is-not-pro-chil/


Fentanyl is infact an issue, one that is not partisan. The vast majority of fentanyl transported into our country are brought in through legal channels, most often US citizens atleast according to our legal data: https://www.kff.org/quick-take/most-sentenced-for-trafficking-fentanyl-are-u-s-citizens/#:~:text=But%20most%20fentanyl%20is%20being,those%20lawfully%20present%20and%20undocumented.

As for your comment on those being illegally deported to an El Salvador torture prison... you're gross. Due process is a right everyone under our jurisdiction has, and deserves. I think you need to understand that WE DONT LIKE BIDEN EITHER and need to be more honest. All you are doing here is acting childish, and frankly, it's incredibly dishonest and disrespectful. Assuming OP is saying the illegal deportation is the only mistake this org has made is genuinly odd and bordering fallacious logic.",5,1745465363.0,t1_moptk6p
1k68ajg,moqa7zi,brozuwu,"First, why would two wrongs make a right lol? 

Yes, border security is complex, and yes, we should absolutely be concerned about human trafficking and fentanyl—that’s not up for debate. But raising those issues doesn’t erase the harm done to people like the man deported to a country he hadn’t lived in since childhood. Plus Trump hasn't even been in office that long for there to be a statistic like that, but it's certainly being headed towards that direction. 

If we care about safety, we also have to care about due process and basic human rights. A single wrongful deportation can mean a death sentence, and that matters. 

Additionally, not sure where you're those statistcs from, I see an increase but not by 400%. I dont agree with the previous administration for their actions that led to that increase. 

If we’re going to talk about which policies hurt everyday Americans, let’s not ignore the economic fallout of the administration’s trade war, which raised prices for American farmers, manufacturers, and working-class families. Retaliatory tariffs slammed our agricultural exports, and U.S. consumers ended up paying more for basics like appliances, electronics, and even clothing and MEDICINE. Not to mention his economic policies which thirteen noble prize wininng economists said was bad, and his tax breaks for the wealthy and increases in taxes for common Americans.

Or who could forget his botched COVID response that led to the needless death of over 400,000 US citizens

Or what about withdrawing from the climate agreement which rolled back 100s of protections nad Set the U.S. back on emissions goals, worsening long-term global climate threats that disproportionately harm low-income communities? 

Or what about his attempted ACA repeal which would affect 20 million americans without healthcare 

You can’t claim to be “America First” if your policies make life harder for Americans just trying to get by. 

I can go on and on about the things that this administration has started, like ignoring supreme court commands (what happeend to the love of the constituion?) Its not one BIG thing its a thousand medium and little things",3,1745465768.0,t1_moptk6p

\- climate change neglect

The perspective is that whether it was their high school teachers or their previous instructors, someone failed  by passing them when they didn't command the material, and it's the current Professor's responsibility to hold the line. I hear of squashed coup attempts like this scenario regularly, and I wish we had their policy here.

Now UCR. I've seen some criminal practices here. I've seen Professors give away passing grades. The coloring books in the form of copy-paste exams or completely chatgpt-able courses (all online unproctored work! in 2025! at a UC!) You have to try to fail a class at this point by being the worst student you can strive to be. But it's on the faculty and college admin. I've seen other students so poor they don't understand week 1 material yet can study a copy-paste exam and regurgitate answers and ultimately pass, knowing nothing. We allow that here. We ENCOURAGE that here. We ENABLE this here.

I believe there are Professors here that interpreted ""work with a minority population"" to mean just give passing grades, they will be unemployable anyway. That's fundamentally racist in my opinion.

telling Bolduc to go f* himself  calling him a bitch for being a millennial, saying he’s trash” and “terrible”, all the other lies like him posting as a redditor or paying RMP reviews is what you guys consider a respectful .

Some of you were even joking about totaling his car. Yeah, totally normal behavior for people who just want a fair grade right?  That’s not even half of it too lol

2) You can delete messages all you want, but it doesn’t erase the fact that multiple people openly admitted they weren’t attending lecture as per poster, but I guess they’re lying cause it’s against you?? Lol  !!

Also you’re acting like it’s the system’s fault? You don’t have any proof you didn’t spoof either or the other guy did.You just expect professors to take your word after you lied about showing up  You really think it’s not suspicious that suddenly a bunch of people with low grades showed up but somehow didn’t check in? Or that they keep listing other grievances on why they didn’t fail and how bolduc just messed up on everything. Seems kinda weird that everything is his fault.

3)PollEv works, it’s used systemwide. Issues didn’t magically appear this quarter. It didn’t magically discriminate towards the lower grade people either. If your check-in failed, it’s because you weren’t there. There’s literally no widespread technical failure reported, I haven’t had issues in previous courses at all for the location.   No one forced you to ignore it until the final week. If this is your argument, I guess all canvas submissions or other online submissions that didn’t go through are part of technical issues so you should get a free pass. Not true when they’re completely reliable. Your guys is argument is you have 20+ answered questions, you can literally answer the question by not checking in.  There is so much other things in courses  I had that were unverifiable, Welcome to being an adult!

4) U guys in the chat are like If we all report him they’ll be forced to act and change the grade lol. Then digging for irrelevant dirt from past quarters to smear his name, trying to get people to SPAM email random admins until someone caves. Like that gets someone’s reputation on their job on the line to Potentially  get them fired.

I totally agree—unless you’re aiming for a hyper-competitive STEM field at a top-tier institution like UCLA or Berkeley, the name of the school matters far less than people think. What’s more important is what you do while you’re there: your GPA, your research experience, your network, and your growth. UCR, UC Merced, and other so-called “lower-tier” UCs still offer incredible opportunities for driven students.

It’s also eye-opening to hear how admissions committees function. A lot of people assume tenured professors are combing through every application, but the reality is much more bureaucratic and imperfect.

A standard practice in my discipline is to not hire grad students from within; the idea being(leaving aside whether you think this is justified or legitimate) is that you need some critical distance between where you obtained your PhD and where you can become an independent researcher/scholar. 

All that is to say is that I am not sure having faculty(or not having faculty) from their respective “home” institution is a legitimate metric to gauge prestige or placement power within a given field.

Of course you’ll lose any sort of debate or look like a fool if your thoughts are “throw tomatoes”, “don’t debate Charlie”, “let’s protest”, “I hate that guy”, etc. It doesn’t help when you want to “beat him” with emotion. Ask yourself why you hate the guy (come up with actual facts), why politics got you triggered, and where have you been getting your ‘education’. If you’re unhappy with “the other side”, why? Chances are it’s because you haven’t taken real consideration and time to find out truths. You most likely see ABC, CNN, Fox, YouTube, and all sorts of legacy media that compete for viewership through sensationalized content. They all spread fear and hate because that’s what drives higher ratings, much more than good news based on facts. If you’re mad or fearful, you’ve been manipulated by what you saw on TV. It’s time to figure out how to be smarter by fact checking everything including your own emotions. Knowledge is power, but lack of it keeps you weak.",1,1747406932.0,t3_1kil6pa

I mean killing children should be recognized as wrong from all sides, but here we are. The people of Gaza have been leading protests against Hamas, Hamas does not represent the entire Palestinian population. If someone is vocal about supporting Hitler they shouldn't be jailed or criminalized. But you need to accept when you do that someone is going to have a problem with it, and you need to accept the consequences that comes with that, whether it's outing you to the community you live in or losing your job. If they begin rounding up people to put in concentration camps yes they should absolutely be jailed, because now their actions are criminalizing/jailing others for their opinions. Do you see the difference? One is a communal response to a terrible opinion (any reasonable/sane person can agree Hitler's views are terrible) one is a criminal response.

A few weeks after this getaway stopped doing no ID Wednesdays.

A. Due to both lack of funds and lack of investment, the place has seen better days, long away are the days that this place resembled a proper dive bar/grill. This has definitely caused issues with the increasing expectations of the incoming students 

B. Covid started the downfall as the culture was disrupted for a prolonged time that led to the decline of popularity. 

C. There has been pushback from the campus itself in regards to supporting the business flourish as there were hikes in rent which put a strain on the relationship between both businesses. It is also stated that a possible conflict of interest was introduced when UCR began heavily funding the Barn. 

It truly is a shame, but we also have to take into account all these factors and realize that current students in general don't cherish the business as much as previous alumni once did.

Copy Pasted:

Special feature with collaboration from The Highlander. ""It was all a lie""... A student who was said to have been injured from a thrown bottle during Wednesday's grad night. Which has caused the police and paramedics to be called to the scene. Was found out that the student had been given a self-inflicted bottle wound. This is evident from footage from inside surveillance cameras in Getaway. The owner Sean, who founded Getaway in July of 1997, was given the information after the police conducted interviews of witnesses; who were then able to evaluate the conclusion of the self-inflicted wound. Yet with this evidence Getaway still faces a shutdown, where they have created a petition to get Chancellor Wilcox to help better the situation for Getaway.
""He can put a stop to everything"" said Sean, due to how he controls all operations of the campus of UCR. How Getaway is having new issues such as 60% increase in their rent bill, a no dancing policy, as well as lack of respect and benefits compared to that of the Barn. With less than 2,000 petition signatures would they be able to reach the acknowledgement of Chancellor Wilcox?",1,1745961721.0,t3_1k5qx1a

1. We’ve probably all heard of the 1:2 ratio of hours needed to study per units taken thing told to us at some point of time, but I can confirm that it’s pretty essential. If you do that consistently, then you genuinely won’t have to spend a crazy amount of hours studying for your exams that all occur roughly around the same time. You can get all A’s/pass all your classes without doing the 1:2 but it’s not a guarantee, so I just stick with it plus however else my professors say to study. 
2. Use office hours, study groups and tutoring at the ARC. All of this is completely free to set up and it’s best to set up a consistent rhythm for ours in these areas just for when you may potentially need help in the future and even when you don’t need help with certain concepts, at least a good review. 

Shit is hard for 80% of students when you don’t do exactly what advisors or professors tell you to do. But if you want success sometimes u just gotta sacrifice a lot of those school events to keep everything together from the gun and have your fun later when everything is truly under control and not being pushed off to the last minute.",12,1730684688.0,t3_1gizvsm

Study on campus before going back to the dorms or your apartment. Find a boring place, like Rivera, to get your reading done. You can get 80% of your reading done between classes and still have time to drink every night. Take a look at your screen time and you will see where most of your time went. Start with those two things, make adjustments and next quarter will be ten times easier.",1,1730758380.0,t3_1gizvsm

Transitions in life are a struggle even those that 'should be' celebrated. The university wasn't just about the classes, but the routine, the connections made, a sense of belonging. The feelings are natural because you had meaning and identified as a student. You are something more and shifting to this reality is going to take a bit of time.  Graduating from university is an amazing accomplishment, and the degree can never be taken from you. There is so much ahead and you're standing on the edge of new freedom.

Regardless of your future plans, graduating isn't really a beginning or an ending, it's a transition, a shift from a predictable routine that you had become familiar with, to a new routine, with new rhythms and patterns.

1kolc13,msu7nah,LordHelix9,"The opposite for me. 

The first time I applied to UCR I didn't get in. I took a lot of AP classes I wasn't prepared for. The UC system uses an unweighted GPA system for admission so I was competing with people who coasted in Gen Ed courses whereas I was lucky to even get a C in classes that were given the same value for GPA.

I eventually got in after spending time at a community College but I wasn't proud of it. When asked by people I met I always said something along the lines of that it was a cost saving thing or that I had a moral opposition to the cost of public universities partially funded by tax money and that I wanted to spend as little money there as possible. I knew it was a lie. I simply thought that I was a fraud. I truly believed I wasn't smart enough to get into ""the joke of the UC system.""

There was one night after class during this past fall quarter when I didn't really feel like going home quite yet and just sat at the bell tower. It's a really pretty structure and took in the view. I realized that going to any four year university is a privilege and that I was here. I wasn't the failure I thought of myself as back at community college.

I am proud to go to UCR. I worked to make it happen. I feel that all of you should be proud to do so as well. The feeling of not accomplishing everything you want exists everywhere. Any university will have people who think that they're not good enough and should have gone somewhere else. No one whose opinion matters will judge you for where you went to school when you get that first job with your degree.

Finals are coming up and it will work out for you. Go in with that mindset and I know you'll do fine.

Attending a UC? Oh man, once you start looking for a job, UC? CSUs? Harvard? Stanford? That means jack shit. I have a job and let me tell ya, my degree didn’t do shit. In fact, my side, fun, gag projects did something more than my degrees did.

Great minds? Debatable. Let’s just leave it at that.

The fact is…don’t get mad or triggered when someone doesn’t say hi back. If you do, that is your issue. Not theirs. If you can’t seem to be able to put yourself potentially in their shoes, that is your issue. Not theirs.",2,1732366180.0,t3_1gxf3ck

1iv2x2u,mfjywqg,_ACuriousFellow_,"Many people have shared your concerns about the club known as **Christians on Campus** which operates on many university campuses across the United States and goes by various names such as **Christian Students on Campus (CSOC)** and **Christians at [University Name].**

They are affiliated with a denomination/sect known as **The Lord’s Recovery** or **The Local Churches** which was founded by a man named **Witness Lee.** These churches use the naming scheme of **”The Church in [City Name]”** (e.g. [**The Church in Austin**](https://churchinaustin.org)). Many ex-members, including many former leaders, have brought up concerns about their teachings and practices as well as serious abuses which have been covered up by leaders of that group. Those who speak up about these things have often been shamed and shunned for their efforts.

As someone who was once part of this sect and as one who served as an officer and later president in their club at UTSA, I have seen that the campus clubs were designed to funnel vulnerable young adults into their churches in order to bolster their numbers. We often made efforts to hide our affiliation with The Lord’s Recovery and Witness Lee when first encountering potential recruits so as not to scare them away, and we would only show more to those whom our leaders felt were ready for “higher truths.” 

We also made efforts to recruit freshmen orientees to our club during the orientation season. UTSA expressly forbade the recruitment of orientees, but we persisted and tried to fly under the radar because we did not want other Christian clubs reaching the new students before us. I’ve already warned the subreddit of my old university, **The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),** [**in this post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTSA/s/YhOuQEuW0l), and a student from Austin has shared their testimony as well for the campus club at [**The University of Texas at Austin.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/s/g6Ti2U3bx2) Another ex-member who was involved with the university clubs posted a video on YouTube with some concerns regarding their recruitment strategies. You can watch it [**here.**](https://youtu.be/Go4Q25Z_m00?si=hnZkigREVa9PlnT5)

Anyone who wishes to see the testimony of various other ex-members may refer to [**this article.**](https://thecuriousfellows.wordpress.com/2025/01/20/testimonies-of-former-members-of-the-lords-recovery/)

Please exercise extreme caution when dealing with this group.",1,1740889672.0,t1_me4t9oq

These things have indeed been reported on multiple campuses where the club known as **”Christians Students on Campus”** is active as well as the churches they are affiliated with.

Likewise, pray that the hearts of the members of these churches would be softened so that they would not shame and shun those who speak up and try to bring these issues to light. Many current and ex-members have been moved by the Lord to speak about these things, and it would be prudent to hear them out rather than dolling out the same harsh treatment that they’ve already experienced and have testified about.

1f8kf9o,llhym2b,ofSomething,"I take any phobic to mean to hate on a group due to choices. Asking about acceptance isn't that. Idc about Trans ppl, normal ppl, gays, whites, etc. Love and live your life. Idc. I mean that sincerely. If anything, I'm people phobic. That question, though? Can it come from a transphoboc person? Sure. But it can also come from someone like me. If you're proud of yourself, identity, and want to be accepted. How can you not be so with family?

The responses I got are... Many people feel like they'll lose the support of their family. Fair. But what support are we talking about? People such as op have answered financial and housing support. So you want your family to support you despite not agreeing with your lifestyle? Once you're 18, you're on your own. Not entitled to anything family wise. If your family disowns you, so be it. It sucks but be authentic, be yourself. Loving yourself. Isn't that a risk you have to take? Comes off as just milking the golden goose while you can then telling your family who you really are when you no longer have anything to lose. I'm not saying that's op or even entirely relevant, just thoughts. Because some people, myself included, think. We have thoughts and ideas. A desire to better understand what goes on in people's heads. The idea of I want to live as this person. Be this person. Yet, not coming out to your family or friends? Seems counterintuitive to me. So yeah, I've asked that question and will continue to do so. Because I want to understand the issue. Just like I'll ask my best friend why he goes back to a toxic female abuser. Are questions inherently phobic? No, the intention is. 

From what you wrote, I take it to mean you define phobic as anything that doesn't cater to your feelings or inversely upsets them. Because that's what phobic means nowadays. Not being against something, no. But not being for it. If you don't support unequivocally every issue of a group, you're labeled phobic. If you do not cater to the feelings with consideration of a group, your phobic. The question you stated is no different than the question you asked. Except one is emotionally charged. People converse to understand. So yeah. Language matters. 

We need to stop generalizing phobia and racism. It minimizes actual issues. Gays and Trans people are being murdered around the world. That's phobia. Not asking someone how can they expect their family to accept themselves if they can't. And especially not having a differing opinion than you. You can not support the ideologies of the movement but still respect those who live it. Our country is quite literally founded on that principal. 

We each have ideas. Beliefs. Ethics. Having one contrary to your narrative does not make a bigot, nor phobic. By the clinical definition, one must take action or expressive verbal action in disparaging a group on a discriminatory basis. Not supporting Trans emotions is not phobia. Asking questions is not phobia. Not believing in the movement is not phobia. It's about intent. Seeking to disrupt, disparage, demean, destroy, or inflict harm is. That's phobia defined. Perhaps whomever you encountered met that definition. But the question itself does not.",1,1725471332.0,t1_llhg7a2

Well, since I am a mail carrier maybe I can offer insight that way.

If you have a valid ID with your new name you can go to your home post office and forward all mail with that name to your dorm (or wherever you live).  Mail forwarding is now a 2 factor authorization to combat mail and identity fraud so they might send something to your parents house for a confirmation. If you have 2 ID, one with the old and current  address that would help alot. You can also ask the clerk to write a special notice card saying to NOT deliver any mail with your new name to this residence.

1f8kf9o,llmeb39,reigningreina,"Hi OP, not even sure why reddit suggested this post to me since I went to college out of CA (was raised there for a part though and was originally planning to go to a UC) but just a few other things to add just because I didn’t see them and I just finished uni within the last few years. I just wanted to tack some other things on as either commentary or advice on additional things you can do and might want to consider adding just to help inhibit the dispersal of your info now that you’re considered fair game in the data market as an adult. 

People mentioned having usps hold your mail. Do you go home often enough you can collect it? They will only hold up to 30 days. You can use forwarding services after that but be aware that forwarding services with USPS can normally take up to 14 days to process. So you want to immediately want to call in to make that hold request then enroll with the forwarding services asap.  Just want to make sure you are aware. 

Also, somewhere within your student website that should include bursar info, academic records for transcripts, enrollment (basing this off my brothers havjng similar websites to mine when they went to uni in CA so I’m assuming these are norms most students can access for their student logins). You should be able to see your permanent address, mailing address, international address etc. You should be able to edit that from your account if you think there is a risk that one day your school could actually send info with your lived name as well. You can set it to your current address/dorm, just remember to change it a week at least before you move from there and somewhere else, even if just home for the summer. It should process within a few days at most and you could have direct access to your mail that way. Just tell your parents you’re needed to set it to school because you needed some important school mail for enrollment or something essential sounding in case they notice a change. 

Second, as you ease into adulthood (I’m assuming you’re an undergrad based off the post, but apologies if I presumed too much on that one 😅), I’d suggest looking into ways people protect their identity online, for starters, from spam calls. The only reason I suggest so is that depending on how long you feel you may need to try to protect your lived identity for you own peace back home, information about your lived name will eventually probably become part of the data tied to you that people use for spam call, other spam mail, that  companies sell to each other. In my experience, I’ve found that using some of the federal laws to prohibit the use of my information for spam calls (google around for stopping spam calls because there’s a few fantastic Reddit posts explaining the several things you can do) trickled into other areas including getting less spam mail because it likely gets marked as useless info and canned instead of sold.  

Thirdly, I’m almost certain that CA the state has a several laws to help people’s privacy or protect them as a consumer that can be used in roundabout ways to your situation or directly. I don’t permanently reside in CA at this time and therefore dont often utilize them so I never followed up on the specific legal how to’s, but I sometimes stumble on different ways to take advantage of CA state laws to your best interest. I’d look into what state law can also do for you. I’m sure you could find some good advice, you’ll just have to do some research on how to.

Unfortunately, with how UCR’s lived name system works, I think this is a one-or-the-other kind of situation; either you use your lived name across the board, or your legal one. I had the same issue last year and ultimately opted out of using one, since I seemingly didn’t have a choice to configure where I did or didn’t want it to be shown. 

Don’t wanna reiterate what others said but definitely make sure you contact the correct department about not wanting physical mail! I don’t know which ones you’re getting mail from but try to reach out to them individually. I know it’s tedious but given how large a school UCR is and how many students they accommodate for, it’s best to play it safe and not be reliant on them to do all the work for you.

I would also like to play devil's advocate and mention that saying your school outed you is a very loaded statement. A lot of schools are just barely updating their systems to allow for lived names. So situations like yours are probably new issues they will have deal with. What I'm saying is I'm sure this was probably an unintended outcome. I'm my experience, most university staff will try to be compassionate and helpful if you reach out for help respectfully.

Though I also understand it doesn't make this happening any less painful or annoying to you.

I would also like to say that it's not like I spent a long time crafting my post either. I did not expect my post to just blow up like this and I didn't expect random people to also make weird assumptions about my character. Truth is, UCR is already not sending me mail, I made sure of this a long time ago.

The truth is, I typed up this post immediately and also when I was upset and didn't expect a huge reaction and over a hundred comments. I was just asking for advice, if anybody had any. It was so spur of the moment, I didn't even think about changing the address. I wasn't aiming to get back at the university or anything.

Cameras are in no way going to ensure you get your stuff back. They're NOT a pursuant measure, theyre a deterrent. The cops usually take footage for reports so you have documentation.

I speak from experience being from a toxic high school in the Bay Area : all of these feelings will disappear once you finally get into college and start interacting with the people around you—they hold no judgement and many of them have rejected top tier programs to be here because of cost and location.  People don’t realize they live in a bubble until they leave that bubble. 


 I would definitely channel these frustrations into developing yourself, your career, and succeeding regardless of which college you’re going! UCR is a genuinely powerful program that serves the local area in huge ways, and you should be honored that you go to a college that has genuinely improved so many people’s lives.

However!

I got in for winter quarter/spring semesters at 

CSU

-Chico

-Northridge

-Fullerton

-San Diego

-Long Beach

I could’ve chosen my original choice Long Beach, but I chose Riverside, the city, for more personal reasons. My sister had to do boarding school here in Riverside, because it was one of two only schools for the Deaf available in the entire state. So Riverside had some personal meaning to me and I know it better than the other schools. UCR was also the only school that gave me the Transfer Regents Scholarship and the place I moved into was affordable and private for me. Can’t beat that.

I was nervous and still feeling a certain way, but after being here since December 2024—I really love it. Are there some issues here in Riverside/UCR? Yes, absolutely. Are there issues at other schools/cities? Yes.

You go where you truly want to go, need to go, and is best for you. Do NOT let somebody else decide things for you-especially on where you pick and go to school to. It’s your life. If you’re happy and proud to get into and SIR’d to UCR——Then accept it and keep moving forward.



Besides. It’s not the only school and you could always choose to go to another school for something like grad school/ professional school.

There are so many resources here, the gym is incredible, the professors are always looking for people to help with research. There is so much opportunity here on top of the financial aid. The faculty is nice, the area is mostly safe. And for first years, it’s pretty great. I mean dorming is honestly not that bad at all.

If you are excited about it, be proud of that. Absolutely congratulations to you. You should continue to be so so proud that you are continuing your education!!! Props to you. Everyone’s gonna tell you different things but at the end of the day, anywhere you go, you get out of it what you put in. So get ready to do some hard work. You got this! Proud of you.

1k4ixl0,moehzzo,Puzzleheaded_Face441,"As someone who graduated from UC Berkeley and later came to UC Riverside for graduate school, UC Riverside definitely is friendlier and warm compared to how cutthroat UC Berkeley is. You may get the prestige, but if you don't do well enough (get high enough GPA), it doesn't matter. So the question becomes: can you get a 4.0 GPA in UCR when you would have gotten a 3.6 or less at UCB? If so, go to UCR. The prestige won't carry you if your grades, work ethic, and experience is ordinary.

The prestige does matter to some extent, but you can make up for it if you put the extra effort into doing extracurriculars or school projects. It really is the amount you put in is the amount you will get out of school. 

I also have a friend who went to Google with a UCR undergraduate - so honestly, if you are a good student, it really doesn't matter that much where you went. 

So, just don't go with the ""Cs get degrees"" mentality and you generally will be fine when you go off to the real world.

Also, in terms of atmosphere, I definitely would choose UCR over UCB. It is rare that you would ever trust your classmates in your classes or make friends with them. Even if they were friends, I've heard of stories of them backstabbing you when it came to missing things in classes. Even the friends I made there were not really lasting. The professors I sometimes had didn't care about you (I had one straight-up said ""Don't come to my OH and don't send me emails"").

1k4ixl0,n3xaonp,Weird_Government2132,"I think you probably know this at some level, but the response you got from your friends is just an honest reflection of how people, in general, perceive UCR. It's just the reality of how people who aren't UCR-affiliated in some way regard the university. All of the validation on r/ucr will not change this. 

However, as others point out, maybe these so-called ""friends"" shouldn't be your friends. You can do better. Real friends would bite their tongue and say ""hey congrats on getting in to UCR, it's not far from L.A.!"" instead of ""why the f would you want to go to that armpit of a school with a bunch of UC Rejects?"" (which is what they're really thinking).

Honestly, feeling hurt and ashamed by how others see UCR isn't a bad thing, IF you can turn it around and use it to motivate yourself. Take an honest look at how you ended up at UCR - could you have studied more? Partied less? Enrolled in more extracurriculars? Gotten better LOR's? Could you turn it around and say now you are starting with a clean slate - can you work your a$$ off, network, excel in your classes, etc. with the goal of ""never having to end up at another 'UCR' for grad school or having to work at a 'UCR' job after graduation?"" You can easily do this. The academic standards in UCR courses are significantly lower than the other UC's. If you just show up and try, you can potentially rack up a 4.0 and transfer out in 2 yrs or even finish summa cum laude. On the other hand, if you simply want to convince yourself that UCR is actually a renowned and reputable institution, and you limit your social network to friends at UCR who also share this delusion, then you might also be very happy with this as well.

Bad reputations don't just spawn out of nowhere-there is usually a lot of truth to them. UCR education is subpar compared to the other UCs, this is an undeniable truth. However, the main issue with UCR is the location and the lack of opportunities here (specifically for poli sci/public policy/pre-law). My major has a required internship, but very few can actually fulfill it with something directly related to the major because there just isn't anything here. Most people are forced to fulfill it with an unrelated on-campus job because Riveraide just doesn't have enough opportunities, and the opportunities availavle just really aren't good. Other UCs are undeniably better at preparing students for the workforce/grad school, this is backed by data from the UC system that demonstrates UCR alumni having the worst outcomes in terms of income after graduation across all majors. So yeah, you can be proud, but don't ignore what you hear about UCR because much of it is true.

As far as some alumni working for FAANG, that's great for them, but I honestly doubt attending UCR actually helped them obtain that role.

I agree that you should absolutely make an effort for opportunities and not depend on the school's prestige alone, however, the effort you make will have to be 10x stronger than what you would have to make at other higher ranked UCs.

You get what you sign up for each quarter and join whatever club makes you happy.

It's alright though, I'll repeat the gist of it: a higher amount of admissions means there will be a higher amount of enrollments, especially when they are enrolling 20,000 more people than last year. This is a problem because the school is already struggling to accommodate the amount of students (not in terms of sheer size, but in terms of infrastructure, like Wi-Fi, dining, walkways in the center of campus, parking lots, academic advisors, etc...). Those issues should be fixed before they increase their admissions by so much.

It's not really true that with the higher the admission rate, the school will be even more overcrowded (it actually seems the opposite from 2024 UC data and prior).  I doubt UCR will suddenly be growing another 20000 students in 2025 if they were only enrolling 26000+ annually (they also had a high admission rate in 2024 as well).

UCR actually enjoys a nicely spaced population and a better quality student/professor/TA ratio compared to other UC campuses.  The land around UCR also appear to have some opportunity for more growth.  

With that said, I agree it will be good for UCR to have necessary infrastructure in place to meet their growing student population (eg. a metro link to the university much like UCSD) to reduce reliance on student parking needs.

I'm so sick of this shit.​",3,1745760757.0,t1_mowtyot
1k6ar5f,mpcxoil,Candid_Source_6091,"They quite literally will?  It costs money to get here, no discussion means no content, no content means no money, no money means they cannot make it here.  And most republicans are not white supremacists.  The majority would rather have every race/ethnicity thrive and be successful productive citizens, but circumstances in US history and immigration have made it difficult for some groups to do so.  Republicans just believe we should take a different approach.

One of the people speaking was Gothix, on her channel she commented that the poster asking, ""Do black lives really matter?"" was meant to question whether the country was actually taking the proper measures to uplift the black community.  They personally believe that it should be handled differently, and lowering things like policing is not going to really help.  Democrats have not done a good job on easing racial relations (polls show Obama worsened them and Biden does not seem to have done much better).  This isn't to say that Republicans have been successful either, the point is that one side does not have the perfect solution.

As to close minded bullshit, Republicans hold conservative and old-fashioned values, now ask yourself, how has America operated for the majority of its history?  The answer is these values.  To say that those are ideas are bullshit makes you very close-minded.   In addition, this idea that Republicans are this looming threat is ridiculous.  They are a loud minority, liberals are the majority, the people who were on our campus were punching up on our ideas, not down.

My personal stance is that we should look at both sides and actually observe what they have to say.  I was hoping to hear actual discussion but was met with mindless protest.  I do not believe republicans and their ideas should be taken into account as those ideas literally propped America up for centuries.  Also, MAGA and Trump are not representative of Republican, conservative, or Christian ideals.  America has been falling apart socially for a while, partially evident in the aforementioned increased racial tension in Obama's presidency.  Obama, a democrat, was expected to help America, but his efforts were lacking.  Trump came in guns blazing offering a group of people real change and to fix these issues, but it was evidently a manipulation tactic to get into power.  Like I said in my original post, these people are misinformed and want to actually make America great again, but they've been manipulated and fed lies.  They are not going to stop existing; our best bet is to provide facts and approach them with understanding and patience.

Edit:  Your reply was not very nice.  I have tried to be polite here and you resorted to name calling instead of actually discussing anything.  I have not said anything against any group of people and have condemned the MAGA movement as being a product of a narcissistic billionaire with no political experience manipulating a worried group of people by exaggerating their fears, lying, and making empty promises of reform.  I'm saying that certain issues are more nuanced than others and are not so black and white.  If you believe that that your ""side"" is fully correct on every single issue and are not even open to hearing and discussing opposing opinions, you are in fact close minded and bring shame to what is supposed to be a place of higher learning as a student.",1,1745780690.0,t1_mpb68ap

1gkt6wy,lvocw7u,Combat_Commo,"Baffled to be honest. California has been blue for a long time so it's almost always a given when it comes to the POTUS election.

However, when I was standing in line at the city civic center today, this old man of Mexican descent was behind me with his either daughter or maybe granddaughter, he could barely speak any English. Then these other early 20-ish Latinos showed up and they were saying ""puro trump"" meaning essentially, ""let's go trump."" These younger dudes could speak both English and Spanish and after the old man heard them say that, they all started talking about how they were going to vote for trump.

Now, why is this baffling to me? I've mentioned before here that I am not a young gun like most UCR students, so I grew up in the 80's and 90's. Back in the 90's, we had a governor called Pete Wilson and a mostly red house and state assembly. Back around the mid 90's, they introduced Proposition 187. This measure was heavily targeted towards illegal immigrants that were of brown skin. Essentially, if anyone even suspected you of being an illegal immigrant, you could be rounded up against your will. California does have a dark history when rounding up immigrants indiscriminately and not just of Mexican descent, but Japanese as well during WW2. Were any Americans of German or Italian descent rounded up and put in camps during WW2? Of course not, they always target non-white immigrants. 

So, this old man behind me was definitely subjected to Prop 187 from back then and yet, he willingly voted for a knowing racist man that has said heinous things against Latinos from his own mouth. Even my own mom who came here illegally but is now a citizen has continuously voted for trump as well as my sister but at least for them, it's a matter of pro-life vs abortion since they are institutionalized Catholics. I also have another cousin who is a permanent resident alien since the 80's here, who is also pro trump although he cannot vote. And I will say it sounds pretty ironic to hear my non citizen cousin blame all of America's problems on immigrants...

I've been saying it on other platforms forms for quite sometime now. I think Democrats just expect minorities to vote blue since they've been doing that for decades and republicans were always seen as devils and in my opinion, that they are after all the crazy things they have said and done.

I'm also a Veteran and republicans have attempted to cut our benefits in the past but yet, most Veterans continue to support them...make it make sense lol

I think the real issue here is that most people just dont know the policies and vote for whoever their candidate hates.  So why even bother talking about policy? trump spent virtually no time talking about his policies at his events and yet, here we are.

But, I digress, in short, it's baffling to see Latinos that were once subjected to Prop 187, now willingly vote for republicans.",101,1730882148.0,t3_1gkt6wy

We have to break the chain at some point and I am ok with paying a bit more in state taxes to fix schools and such. 

The rich and powerful would love to have poor kids stay poor so that they can exploit them once they hit the workforce but that goes against my morals and values.

The other thing that I don’t think people really want to talk about is the gender element. I have a few Latino friends who are typically blue but weren’t voting for Kamala, and one even flat-out said it’s because she’s a woman.

1gkt6wy,lvoo5ea,Combat_Commo,"Oh yes, I absolutely agree that certain Latino groups are still very machismo. It really depends on their up brining. Granted, every case may be different, I came from a very poor family and my parents only had a 3rd grade education since that's the highest level their Mexican rancho could offer. I agree there are certain sub-biases that exist here. 

Even my sister who had previously voted against trump mentioned that she didn't like Kamala which surprised me. I asked her why and she said ""because I saw a video on tiktok."" So I was like are you serious? This just proves to me that even some Latino woman were against Kamala based on nothing really other than perhaps the fact she was a woman. Even my own wife, who is a permanent resident and hates trump, said she wasn't sure if a woman could do the job because of menopause and such...

My sister is not college educated and my wife grew up in Mexico so she only finished up to 9th grade because her machismo grandfather, which she grew up with along with her grandmother, wouldn't let her go to high school because he was afraid she'd find a boyfriend. Neither are college educated but also do not make any attempts to figure things out for themselves in this case, it's like they're prisoners in their own minds I really don't know.

If I hadn't been such a rebel growing up listening to Rage Against the Machine or being such a huge Nirvana fan since Kurt Cobain was very pro-woman, I'd probably be machismo too.

America is too uneducated to know what its best interests are, and that may be its undoing. I also heard recently that Military recruitment is really low now so America really needs to take a look in the mirror and find itself before it's too late!",10,1730888793.0,t1_lvojec3

She was the lowest rated Vp in history. She was NOT voted to be the nominee, and if there was a primary she would never have won it against any average democrat. 

And what you said in your last comment says everything that needs to be said. 

It’s not because she is the most unlikable, least genuine example of a presidential candate- who NEVER did interviews outside of heavily edited scripted interviews. And it couldn’t be that she spent the entire campaign calling half the country practically Nazis and her buddy Biden calling Americans garbage. Or the fact that she never appeared to moderates, libertarians, or independents. 

No, the reason she lost is because American is sexist and racist. 

No, they voted because she’s a terrible example of a fake politician and people are tired of the race baiting.

1. She’s a woman and Trump immediately calling her race into question to discredit her amongst people who have labeled her a liar (Sexist and racist America, I know. We’d rather have  convicted felon than a woman)

2. Trump’s social media sugar baby, Elon, and the internet in general. There is so much misinformation spread about Kamala that people made their minds up before Election Day. No one wants to research things themselves. I argued with someone because they thought Kamala said something that was disproven by a simple google search. Not to mention Twitter is so full of right winged content now, you literally can’t escape it. There’s so much AI bs and cut videos that people instantly believe Kamala is this evil woman 

3. Palestine Activism/Third Party Voting. Disclaimer: I am 100% against the genocide of Palestinians. I am not fond of the third party votes, however, basically voting for Trump. I know even with those votes, Kamala wouldn’t win but my point still stands. I wish we didn’t just have two people to pick from but our hands are tied, we need to allocate our votes to one or the other. The thing that boggles my brain the most is people saying “I’m not voting for Genocide!” And then they vote Trump like?? He doesn’t care about the Genocide and will keep letting it happen. Kamala has been vocal about being against it happening and has wanted an end to the war. 

4. People fumbling the voting system: I’ve seen a lot of people either genuinely not registering to vote or putting “funny and silly” things on their ballot for TikTok views and it’s lowkey very annoying. Some people straight up didn’t vote which was 10 times more annoying. 

5. Ballot error/ballot burning. Not saying this is any one groups fault but why are we burning ballots like at all?? The candidate you want has votes in there too, why burn them and screw up the numbers again?

Plus, the Dems calling half the country Nazis, garbage, and using 1930s Germany rhetoric is never a good look when you’re trying to get moderate republicans over to your side.

Yet, as I reflect upon the fruits of labor seized and squandered in the form of taxes, I am compelled to question the wisdom of those who clamor for ever more. When a person of modest means rises to prosperity, they see all too clearly the folly and wastefulness that often mars our government’s use of hard-earned wealth. I do not propose we forsake the public good, but rather that we root out the waste within it. Surely, there are stores untapped, funds mismanaged, programs bloated. I recall, for instance, an audit of UCLA, which had accumulated vast sums while still demanding more in the form of rising tuition. All the while, this institution owns properties around the school and reaps revenues untold, and yet still asked more of its students.

There are those here who accuse Trump of racism without reckoning on truth. Consider, if you will, Vivek Ramaswamy, a man of Indian heritage, he stands allied with Mr. Trump, a man of complex character, yes, but not the caricature drawn by his adversaries. How absurd the notion that one who stands against illegal crossings at our borders should be deemed a racist! Rather, he stands, as he has said, for an orderly nation—a nation that knows who comes and goes upon its soil, that it might safeguard its people and its peace. Immigration, he supports; unlawful trespass, he does not.

I ask, what have those at the helm of California wrought? Once a land of promise, now a land many cannot afford, its people driven to despair as corporations depart. While some despise these enterprises, we cannot deny the livelihoods they provide, nor the taxes they yield. California, once in surplus, now finds its coffers barren, Newscum has spent without thought of the morrow. And some, rather than look to their leaders, cast their blame upon Trump, though he was but four years in office, a brief chapter in a much longer tale of power and privilege, of interests entrenched and unchanging since the days of the Clintons. This, perhaps, is the swamp Mr. Trump speaks of—a deep state, old in power and resistant to the change he brought, or sought to bring.

Look upon the old Republican Party—it lies as a relic, its neocon heirs now finding shelter among the Democrats. Figures such as Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney, Mike Pence—once hawks of the right, now find strange comfort beside Kamala and the Democratic Party. That party, once the voice of the common man, has grown a strange alliance with the giants of commerce, with big pharmaceutical powers, with engines of war. And where has it left the working man, who now finds voice among Republicans, who once stood as his adversaries?

If inflation is +2% a year, and the Dow has returned 46%/year, over the last 15 years, why are people “suffering”?

But these things didn't seem to be much of a priority in the debates - it seemed everything but those two questions was on the table. Trump seemed pretty stressed about the wars, saying how terrible they were and how he would end them. But the Biden team seemed pretty nonchalant about them. That may have struck a chord with some people. 

So what were they talking about in the debates? Instead of talking about things that the Federal government would be directly involved with (wars, climate change), they were talking about internal US affairs. Maybe some people don't care as much about internal US affairs at the Federal level, as the states can also handle a lot of that at the state level (abortion, immigration).

Also it seems people were advocating to not vote for Trump because of how bad of a person he is. If that's all the Trump administration is attacked for, is Trump as a bad person, then it may have given the impression that the actual policies of Trump really weren't an issue - in other words, Trump is lousy as a person, but his policies may not be that bad (since he's being attacked as a person, a lot more than his policies are being attacked).

And there is one side that wants girls to give birth the moment they reach puberty. I think it's obvious what the sane and moral person would choose.",3,1738816183.0,t1_mb8kaba

people who are pro-life like to act like women just want to ""kill babies for no reason,"" but often, women go through abortions for external reasons out of their control. abortions are painful and expensive, no person is putting themselves through that for fun.  
  
they may want an abortion due to a lack of money or time, or the circumstances in which the zygote was conceived, but either way, no one but the woman should get the final say on what to do with her own body.",3,1738823645.0,t1_mb7jwvw

This reminds me a bit of Brandy Lewis (English prof). Don't take her btw!!! She also had a furrysona, but that wasn't what I had issue with.

She turned English 1C into a class about comics, comic conventions, and fanzines. I don't dislike those topics, in fact I like them, but the issue I had was that it was mostly just her own opinions on the topics. On essays, she graded them badly if she just ""felt like it was running out of steam"" or ""lost control after page 5."" Beyond that she couldn't explain.

Also the ""example essays"" (that everyone in class pointed out didn't follow the rubric she made) turned out to be written by her, and we didn't know until she told us she wrote them. She used made-up My Little Pony names like ""Sunburst Stallion"" and was bad at explaining things. Over half the class had under 75% overall grades. Tanked a bunch of our GPAs. I should have listened to the Rate My Prof but I'm good at English and am also a CRWT major so I thought it wouldn't be that bad. My writing ability was not what was graded however, but rather her preferences, and how much others agreed with her.

I would imagine that involving the Ombuds department would be a real pain for MCS since they are an outside entity.

To put this another way, it's exactly the same problem we have with healthcare companies and military contractors.

Colleges have been absolutely, hand over fist, screwing students, because they can - and because the federal student loan program has made it extremely simple for students to take out life-altering amounts of debt without a second thought. 

If there’s a cap on debt, then schools will finally have to get their tuition under control or they won’t have any students - and people can go to school again without carrying loans into their 60’s.

\-HPSP scholarship or the NHSC one. its competitive. i dont even want to serve but id do this for free tuition. worth it in long run for me. the HPSP iirc lets u do 2 yrs of tuition for 2 yrs of service. or 3yrs tuition for 3 yrs of service or 4 yrs etc etc. it doesnt have to be all 4 years. but dont quote me on this i havent researched it in a while.   
\-private loans (as low interest as possible)  
\-work after undergrad and build credit ASAP. after a few years of building excellent credit, look into private loans again and see if you get better rates  
\-explore other career options. if i was in this situation and i decided med was not worth it anymore id look into being a PA, dental hygienist, nursing. with PA being my top choice since its 3yrs and cheaper than med school  
\-look into studying abroad. i have no idea how this would work but maybe other countries would offer loans with no cap? look into it.  
\-work for a couple of years and then apply to med schools (put aside as much of your income as possible in high yield savings account to pay for med school). idk how well this would work or how long it would take. this would be last resort imo.

The bill limits parents to borrowing $20,000 per year for each child, with a $65,000 total cap per student. It also limits graduate students to $20,500 per year in loans and $100,000 in total, while students in professional schools, like medical school, are limited to $50,000 in loans per year and $200,000 in total.

Virtual AI consultations will soon handle colds, infections, and chronic disease management, escalating only complex cases to human doctors. As healthcare systems face rising demand and doctor shortages, AI offers scalable relief. GPs won’t vanish, but AI will become the first line of care for most.

Fuck that shit. We need to stop doing that shit. They need to be shouted at and ridiculed because they're hateful fucking assholes. There is no debating people like that. We need to spread the message to stop debating people like Kirk and ridicule and humiliate them. Press them on their cruelty and hatefulness no matter what.

I know morals will always be subjective, but genuinely, if you went up to a pro life man/woman and say you aborted babies for fun, vs you went up to a POC man and say you hate his race, we all know that one case is more likely to result in your shit getting rocked. These morals that the stereotypical right wing person hold are clearly not as based on feelings and experience that the average leftist tends to hold. There are certainly conservative people that mean well, I’m not trying to dehumanize all conservatives, but like genuinely when it comes to the bigotry spewed by the right vs the “moral wrongdoings” of the left, it’s so infuriating how much of it is propaganda induced morality.

1kyp8pe,muz36po,awkotacos,"She has one degree in multiple sciences and another in mathematics. Both received from Crafton Hills College.

&gt;June is the time of the year when most elementary school students get excited about their summer break. But Alisa Perales, who just turned 11 years old this month, will be preparing for her next big step: Going to UC Riverside.

&gt;The girl from San Bernardino already made history in her Inland Empire community as she became the youngest person to graduate from Crafton Hills College, a community college in Yucaipa, with a degree in multiple sciences and another in mathematics.

&gt;The college said she would have earned two more associate degrees, in physics and computer science, if she stayed for one more semester.

&gt;Instead, Allisa will be pursuing her bachelor’s degree in computer science at UC Riverside in September.

&gt;“It’s a big moment,” the whiz kid said. “I’m ready to move onto a new school and meet new friends.”

&gt;Sending her off to a four- year college is also a rewarding outcome for her father, Raphael Perales, who spotted her love of learning at an early age.

&gt;After mastering basic ABCs and 123s by her first birthday, Alisa was ready to expand her knowledge, so her father homeschooled her until when it became the time for Alisa to start Crafton Hills College at age 8.

&gt;“She’s been different her whole life, but I have always taught her that there’s nothing out there she’s not capable of understanding,” the father told the community college before the graduation.

&gt;Raphael insisted that he did not set out a rigorous schedule or goal for the young girl. Rather, he said he simply followed her lead as the girl’s thirst for knowledge and interest in school grew.

&gt;“I responded to what she was interested in and helped feed that interest and fueled that fire,” the proud father said.

Edit: Just to be clear, “failed genius” doesn’t mean they aren’t successful—it just means they didn’t live up to what the world expected from them. A lot of geniuses end up becoming teachers or pursuing something they’re passionate about, rather than chasing what’s considered a ‘higher’ achievement.

Going to college is more than just getting some paper degree, it's about getting an experience in multiple facets. It's about classes, meeting people and taking advantage of experiences and opportunities. At 11 can she even take advantage of internships? I know in California teens can't work until like 16 and even then need like permission from parents and school. My brother when trying to get a job in high school couldn't land one, and it took the combo of Covid + a local restaurant getting desperate for workers to hire him on in the back kitchen. She's also pretty much not gonna have dating life. Also if she does make friends, a lot of those older friends/classmates are not gonna be comfortable sharing more adult topics with someone who isn't even 13 yet.

Like babies younger than 12 months are still learning object permanence with peekaboo and just starting to say mama and Dada. Like once a kid has language figured out, you can kind of force feed em education probably faster than k-12, but a ton of k-2nd grade is like still kind of learning the English language to some extent. Idk how she had like a child development rate like 3 or 4 years ahead of schedule, like that actually doesn't make sense.

It is also not too terribly difficult to transfer out with two AA degrees under one’s belt.

I continued doing the highest level of every program up until I went to high school and got into [scholars academy ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholars_Academy) often recognized as south Carolina #1 educational program

When i went to UC Santa Cruz in 2012 I went to Merrill college. We were in a big auditorium with all the incoming freshman. The guidance counselor asked us to raise our hand with who came in with 5 transfered credits. 10, etc etc. We kept going. I had my hand up until 100. I took 9 AP courses and 11 college classes throughout high school. I was the equivalent of a junior at 18, I could have graduated that year if I played my cards right. She had worked there for 30 years and not a single student had ever come in with more than 50. So I'm not average

And guess what? The honors schooling system failed me and failed most people I know. We're all just average workers. And most of us burned out. What ever happened to the articles of these same ""kid geniuses"" from the 2000? The kids who were my age? Nothing. Nothing ever happens with these kids. 

This entire ""omg my kid graduated at 11"" is misguided and abuse of what education and maturation of a human being should accomplish. Rushing someone into that position and putting their mind on a pedestal will lead to nothing but burnout and failure. This shit is stupid. As someone who was essentially one of these kids.

1kyp8pe,mv05xri,ChikenCherryCola,"IQ is bullshit though. Its better at measuring how close you were born to Europe or america and how much money your parents made when you were a kid than it is at measuring your intelligence.

The other thing is autism isn't a super power and you're not like helping people with autism by suggesting that is is.

The thing about learning and education is you really just need to know how to read and write and the will to put in the work, but anyone can learn anything. Like we sort of act like only smart people can major in math or physics or engineering, and like that's bullshit. Most math and engineering students couldn't complete a philosophy pr literature major and the reason isn't lack of intelligence, it's lack of desire to read like 1000 pages per week of old ass books. Similarly most majors couldn't finish a chemistry degree mostly because they just don't have the will do the math and stuff. Any grad student will tell you though, once you've completed one program, you realize you could probably do any other if you had the desire to put in the work on a subject. Really this is mainly what the k-12 system sort of sets kids up to do, you're just learning how to learn and sort of doing reps go build stamina. Its not implausible for a child to sort of reach this point much earlier earlier than age 17 or 18, the k-12 system is meant to educate all the kids together at the same time which can be somewhat inefficient and inconvenient for specific individuals, but that's not like an IQ thing. Some kids, poor kids usually, have a hard time focusing all of their life on school when they have to grapple with a more harsh reality that wealthier ones.

What's surely impressive about this girl is her very early infant development. Baby humans have this weird thing where we're born like partially developed mainly in the brain department. Most animals are born with the ability to walk and feed themselves, humans are born kind of at this medium of the maximum size of a skull that a mother's birth canal can facilitate, but a baby is still at a level of development that in most other animals would still be in utero. You're first like 36 months are really like kind of intense brain development to be happening outside of a womb or an egg, we're talking developing the cognition like object permanence a full year after having been born. Some how this girl had already allegedly mastered the ABCs by 12 months when normally a baby shouldn't have the capacity for speech beyond mama and dada at that point. That's not a point of intelligence, that's a point of why does your 12 month old have the developed brain of a 3 year old. At any rate, if sounds like she was able to effectively start kindergarten at age 3 or 4 instead of 5 or 6 and she did it with a home school program, which anyone whos taken one will tell you can blast through a GED equivalent in just a few years if you can read and write English effectively. Blasting through k-12 education in 4-6 years is basically what students at the remedial schools to (the like you got kicked out of normal high school so now you're in last chance school to still get a high school diploma by age 17-19 even though your starting at like age 14-17. Its wild that this girl was able to start doing this at age 3 or 4, but given that she was it's plenty plausible for her to be in college.

Unfortunately people will say oh it’s what the kids says they want to do, which may be true, but often times could say that because they want to make their parents happy. I mean look at a lot of the childhood actors now, they expressed this as well. I’m not saying it’s a good or a bad thing, but it definitely does come with some negatives. 
A famous case of this actually is the Unabomber weirdly enough he went to college at a young age and expressed feeling very isolated from his peers and ended up seeking validation from some bad actors.
End of the day nothing is ever all good or all bad, but many of the worlds brightest scientist and thinkers experienced childhood and so on in a somewhat normal order and didn’t take away from their contributions.

1kyp8pe,mvjm3rw,nyquil-fiend,"I’m not informed in the research. I also don’t think holding them back from pursuing advanced education early is good either. However I think there’s a tenancy for bright, intellectual kids—and this applies to many MIT students (including myself) not just the prodigies—to over-emphasize the intellect, become hyper, rational, and apply logic to everything. (I’m talking about people interested in math and science specifically, as with this girl.) 

When one’s identity hinges on being highly intellectual, it’s a huge hit to the ego when one discovers that they are not developed in other areas of life. A common response is just to double down on the intellectualizing. What we end up with is an academic system filled with professors who think they’re the smartest people in the world, but really only know how to think and not relate to people and thus actually miss out on most of the world. I think doing good science relies on being a balanced person who can understand that reality isn’t just the intellect or the physical or the measurable. There’s definitely a difference between knowledge and wisdom. 

We have too many very knowledgeable experts with no wisdom it seems. Just look at what humans have done with technology in the past 50 or 100 years; as a species we race into technologies we aren’t wise enough to use well. Isn’t it interesting how new technology is always used by the military first? Nuke, autonomous drones, GPS… At this point I’m ranting a bit. 

Obviously, plenty if not, most people end up branching out. But if you look at the professors who occupy top seats and academia, you’ll find the type of people I’m talking about. Ultimately many intellectual people end up being very self-serving and that they are just studying things that they’re interested in, which is great, but so much effort and resources are put into things which are contributing to warfare or don’t matter at all. Why not really try to grow as a society? I hate to see genius distorted by an ill society instead of geniuses healing society and removing said distortion.

There isn’t an ideal situation for children like that. But then again there’s hardly ever an ideal situation for anybody. Certainly we can do better than allowing an 11-year-old to pursue one college degree after another. The intellect is clearly already hyper developed, take advantage of a young plastic brain to develop other areas to make a more balanced human. Of course, the path of least resistance for her is to continue being praised for her success and continue an academia. I’m just doubtful that route will be the most elucidating for her self discovery in the long run.

What’s the solution? I’m not sure but I think it’s integral education. We need to develop the mind, body and spirit of an individual and not just their mind. The ecosystem of academia is not conducive to that in its current state, but it can be if we change it. As for this 11-year-old right now?

The paradox of tolerance, as outlined by Karl Popper, can be applied to the behavior of some liberal college students who suppress ideas opposing their own, drawing a parallel to the authoritarian tactics of groups like the Brownshirts in Nazi Germany. Popper argued that unbounded tolerance can enable intolerant ideologies to flourish, ultimately destroying the tolerant society that permits them. However, the paradox also implies that tolerance must be defended by resisting intolerance, which creates a tension when considering free speech and the exchange of ideas.
When liberal college students shout down, cancel, or prevent speakers with opposing views (e.g., conservative, controversial, or traditionalist perspectives) from expressing their ideas, they may justify their actions as defending tolerance—claiming they are protecting marginalized groups or combating harmful ideologies. However, this can mirror the intolerance they oppose. By stifling open discourse and silencing dissent, they risk embodying the very authoritarianism they claim to resist, akin to how the Brownshirts used violence and intimidation to suppress political opponents in Weimar Germany. The Brownshirts didn’t engage in debate; they shut it down through force and fear, undermining the democratic exchange of ideas.
The paradox here is that while these students may believe they are upholding tolerance by rejecting ""intolerant"" ideas, their methods can erode the principles of free speech and open inquiry that are foundational to a tolerant society. If they deem certain ideas too dangerous to be heard, they assume the role of arbiters of acceptable speech, which can slide into dogmatic control over discourse. This parallels the Brownshirts’ tactics, not in scale or violence but in the impulse to eliminate rather than engage with opposing views.
Popper’s solution to the paradox suggests that a tolerant society should tolerate all views except those that actively seek to destroy tolerance itself (e.g., ideologies advocating violence or oppression). However, this boundary is tricky in practice. Many of the ideas suppressed on campuses—such as debates on immigration, gender, or cultural values—do not inherently advocate harm but are labeled as such to justify censorship. This overreach risks creating an environment where only one worldview is permitted, undermining the diversity of thought that universities are meant to foster.
In short, when liberal college students block the free flow of opposing ideas, they may inadvertently embody the intolerance they claim to fight against, echoing the Brownshirts’ suppression of dissent. The paradox of tolerance warns that true tolerance requires defending open discourse, even for ideas one finds objectionable, unless those ideas directly threaten the foundations of a free society.

1khe0zq,mxua3eb,WashNo8368,"your rebuttal mischaracterizes the original argument and hinges on rhetorical flaws that undermine its credibility. The post highlighted the paradox of tolerance—articulated by Karl Popper—as a principle suggesting tolerance must defend open discourse unless ideas threaten a free society, using the historical analogy of Brownshirts to caution against dogmatic suppression. Your response, rather than engaging this nuance, pivots to an unsubstantiated claim that the ""right (largely) is* advocating for the destruction of tolerance,"" a sweeping generalization lacking evidence from the text or context. This ad hominem shift, paired with the condescending ""God, you’re so close"" and the vague ""keep reading"" directive, dodges substantive debate, relying instead on emotional appeal and assumed superiority.
Your assertion that the ideologies in question are unequal, with the right inherently intolerant, ignores the post’s point: both sides can fall into intolerance if they block discourse. The claim that ""the opposition is just trying to exist"" oversimplifies the issue, framing one side as inherently virtuous without addressing their actions—e.g., the violence implied in the SF State context—which the original post critiques. This selective framing is a strawman fallacy, misrepresenting the argument as a defense of fascism rather than a call for consistent tolerance.
The paradox of tolerance doesn’t judge ideologies’ inherent merit but warns of the risk of replacing one dogma with another. Your rebuttal fails to refute this, instead injecting bias and avoiding the core issue of balancing free expression with societal defense.

""embarrassing yourselves by canceling him"" could be a multitude of different accusations and critiques with variable sensibility. to believe kirk is acting more civil than who he's debating appears to implicate that kirk has better posturing and conviction. rather than kirk isn't using disingenuous debate tactics on a selective group of people who aren't as prepared to counteract it. i want to explain why i think it appears this way; as i can give an example in the case of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia.

kirk does not begin the debate to acknowledge the immigration law for due process, or the requirements for asylum and withholding of removal. instead, he emphasizes the accused character and labeling of Abrego Garcia. even using the crowd to further gain validation and attempt to delegitimize the person he is debating. he uses these accusations without acknowledging that the origins for him being MS-13 come from an informant in a different state, which was never cross-examined. along with suspicion about his clothes attire and his proximity to MS-13 members while he was looking for work at a Home Depot in 2019. certainly it is proof that he is MS-13 because two immigration judges that overlooked his bond hearings denied his bail due to a much looser consideration of presented evidence, including hearsay. and that despite all of this he still was allowed a withholding of removal, as not only was it not found that the evidence of being MS-13 sufficent to rule on; the hearing for his withholding required tighter consideration from the judge. who found his story sufficient. of course kirk will not acknowledge this, as throughout the whole debate, he has convicted Abrego Garcia is MS-13 and does everything to keep it that way, all so he can justify that his deportation was a good thing. and that due process doesn't mean that the government needed to go to a judge to present a case why Abrego Garcia should get his witholding of removal revoked.

this is what i mean when something is disingenuous, and why it isn't a constructive experience to interact with him.",2,1747074271.0,t1_mrwg8gk

UCR is still one of the newer UCs and has been in the UC system much less time compared to other UCs. In the 70s, UCLA had an acceptance rate around 70%. Now, it is one of the most competitive schools to get into in the United States alone. I am willing to bet that UCR is going to follow the same path; it is already top 1.3% of universities worldwide and opened as a college campus less than 100 years ago.

The only addendum I want to add, though, is that just because I have love for these places doesn't mean they don't have their own issues, and I think people should still be allowed to speak about valid grievances like UCR's failure to accommodate commuters when that's something they advertise or SB not having any affordable housing whatsoever because these places do still have issues that shouldn't be ignored regardless of our love for them.",11,1744790437.0,t3_1k0ckv0

The weather is horrid, the summers are unbearably hot at 110+ degrees a lot of the time, it has some of the worst air quality in the country (I know, I was part of a research project tracking it and wrote papers on the issue), and it is downright dirty, with graffiti and trash everywhere.

The president at RCC is from Sacramento and refuses to live in the city. During meetings on campus, she would try to get us to conspire with the police against the city's most vulnerable. Weirdos from out of state come to school board meetings to harass queer children.

What doesn't help is the constant influx of people who seem to think the IE ain't sh\*t and belittle it the entire time while they get what \*they need\* from the city and then leave.

1k0ckv0,mne00ok,BLINKONCEGV,"No, let people voice their opinion. UCR is an awful school. The education is a joke. So many professors don't care and read off the slides word for word with no energy or enthusiasm. Literally, UCR feels like a horrible community college. Out of my two years here, I can maybe name like 3 professors who were actually great and taught classes in a way that was beneficial. 

On top of that, the city is horrendous, and there's literally no opportunities. Don't believe me? Go speak to a career counselor and see how it goes. I just did, and all she did was give me a tutorial on how to use handshake. Im 4th year and I'm about to graduate... Of course I know how to use handshake, but she had to waste the time somehow since she had nothing of value to share. 

Lastly, so many people here are beyond rude and unfriendly. The biggest lie I heard about UCR was that people are ""so nice and down to earth."" That's a blatant lie that people say because they can't compliment UCR on any of the important features (academics, professional development, etc.) Honestly, the amount of people that will have attitude when u just met them is so shocking. Clubs are so unwelcoming also. They feel like you're intruding in an already established friend group that has no desire to welcome new people. The only time people are ""nice"" are when you have a class with them and they want to use you for answers on hw assignments. 

It's objectively true that all of the other UCs (apart from maybe UCSC) are better than UCR in every single way and it's not even close. Don't be mad at people who actually wanted a strong college education, robust opportunities, and a welcoming campus and social life for voicing their opinions. UCR will never improve if people like you just shut valid criticisms down and spew objectively false nonsense at how amazing UCR is. Look up average incomes among the UC alumini, you can sort the data by school and see that UCR is one of the worst.

I can go on. But the point stands that UCR is horrendous and its horrible reputation is deserved. Before I came here, I actually had a friend who graduated from her and I asked her for some advice, she warned me not to come here. I didn't listen and thought she was being dramatic, I was even ready to prove her wrong. But wow, I really should've listened to her.

UCR professors sometimes DO read off the slides, but so do the ones at UCLA, UCB, UCSC, literally any other university. Professors will always have their specific teaching ways REGARDLESS of where you decide to go. 
Riverside does lack opportunities within its perimeters, but you act like Uber/Lyft aren’t options, Zip-cars on campus you can use, on top of the already INCLUDED in your tuition RTA program. You can literally bus your way partially to most of those opportunities. 
And to the very end, you will NEVER find a campus that doesn’t include rude people on it. Living, walking nightmares exist on every campus, as well as select clubs that are genuinely large friend groups. This just tells that YOU didn’t use your two years to explore other welcoming groups OR programs that are absolutely amazing and kind to students. There are literal groups dedicated for transfer students. You didn’t bother using the one UCR website that has it all together????

Also, mind that UCR quite literally started as a UCB funded research facility. Eventually, once the school was actually established, a lot of its UCB funding was cut. It grew, and COVID cut that down further. Even then, we have PLENTY of programs and resources to help out students. You just didn’t make use of any of them.",3,1744825247.0,t1_mne00ok
1k0ckv0,mnh2w5h,BLINKONCEGV,"There are so many dumb points in this post that it's sad to even read.

First of all, if you did basic math, you would've realized that I'm literally a transfer student, hence why I did 2 years here, but I'm a 4th year student. So, transferring to another school was not a viable option for me.

Yes, bad professors exist at ALL schools, i never once denied this. But other schools, especially other UCs, make up for it with strong reputations, a wide range of available opportunities, and strong connections with companies/organizations for recruitment. UCR fails in these areas as well, which is why it's such an awful school. 

Bus my way to where? San Bernardino? LOL that's probably worse than Riveraide. Be serious. Unless you're bussing like 2-3 hours out, you're not getting to any good opportunities. Basic logistics proves you wrong here. 

I joined many clubs and quickly realized a pattern at UCR. I also engaged with the transfer events when I first got here. You're literally making assumptions with no basis. UCR is not this friendly environment you're trying to make it out to be. The people are, in general, very rude and unwelcoming. You saying I just didn't ""do enough"" to find the friendly people proves that. 

Did you even read my post? You're saying i didn't ""make use of the programs and resources"" when I attended multiple career events and information sessions and spoke to multiple career/internship counselors during my time here. I literally said in my post that I had just had a meeting with a career counselor from the career center... and it was a waste of time. I've given this school plenty of opportunities to prove me wrong, but it has failed every time.

Anyways, it's clear you're just blindly defending UCR. All of your points just prove mine that it's an awful school and in a dead city. Your main defense is ""the other UCs also have this issue,"" yet you fail to realize that the others UCs make up for it, UCR does not.",-5,1744836593.0,t1_mng0v4o
1k0ckv0,mnh4tku,Cheap_Translator2011,"1) Yes. Anyone can do the simple math, but if YOU had actual literacy, you’d see I emphasized transfer programs because I’m a transfer too. You are not a unique situation, because YOU are not unique. You are one in thousands going to this school as a transfer. And yes, transferring AGAIN is viable because many transfers HERE will also transfer elsewhere. Don’t blame the university for your lack of willpower to transfer again. 
2) Again, your lack of willpower is bringing you nowhere. In the ONE month I worked a campus job, I got two recommendations from the Financial Aid Office Faculty for one permanent position there, and a second one elsewhere in Riverside. UCR has these opportunities that YOU aren’t looking for. 
3) Yes, bussing your way works. Not fast enough? Get a bike or use a Zipcar which, again, is another resource that YOU have access to. I got to work in DTR as a part of the university, which is only 2 miles. What, you somehow can’t bus the two miles? Excuse after excuse. 
4) If EVERY single person you’ve met is somehow a rude, unsociable groupie… maybe YOU are the problem? Because I’ve met the absolute despicable of the bunch, and I’ve also met the kindest, honest, most helpful classmates and club members. 

I’m not blindly defending anything. It just seems like YOUR lack of willpower is something you like to blame onto your fellow peers, bringing them down with you.",3,1744837168.0,t1_mnh2w5h
1k0ckv0,mnh8qfy,BLINKONCEGV,"Lol, you're so mad and delusional it's funny. Willpower to transfer out? Why would I transfer out as a student with senior standing, potentially delaying my graduation, increasing costs, etc? That would be a very dumb decision, I'll leave those to you since it clearly fits your character.

I also worked on an on-campus job. You're not special, and you haven't done anything I didn't do. UCR has opportunities, sure, that was never my point. My point is that the opportunities fail in comparison to the other UCs. AGAIN, go back to my original post and look at the link I posted from the University of California itself. You can lie all you want about how amazing UCR is, but the numbers don't lie, and they are not on your side.

Im not making excuses, I'm saying the opportunities here are NOT worth bussing to. Im from LA, and I constantly throughout my time in CC. I had a job my second year that required me to bus for 2 hours, I did it because it was worth it. UCR has low quality opportunities, even compared to my CC. If you wanna bus 2 hours for some unpaid internship at an unknown low quality firm, then be my guest. Unlike you, high-acheiving students here actually want ROBUST opportunities and are struggling to find them here. 

Ah yes... people being closed off for no reason and rude makes me the problem, amazing deflection. At CC, I had absolutely no trouble making friends. Im even still close with many of the amazing ppl I met at CC. What's more, CCs have worse reputations in terms of social life, but my CC was much more friendly and welcoming compared to UCR. Honestly, judging by the way you responded to my first post, you're probably just one of the rude and snippy people at UCR. 

Lastly, yes, i had a lack of willpower to attempt to transfer to another school as a senior standing student because that would be a beyond stupid thing to do. Keep in mind that I did not blame my ""fellow peers"" for the downsides of UCR. Most of my criticisms are aimed at the quality of the school and its location. I only mentioned peers to debunk a myth that UCR is a supportive and welcoming place. You speak about literacy but couldn't comprehend this basic point. How sad.",1,1744838370.0,t1_mnh4tku
1k0ckv0,mngwez2,BLINKONCEGV,"The people trying to defend UCR are funny. Telling me to ""transfer out"" when I literally transferred in and I said I'm a 4th year lol. Also, defending UCR by saying ""All the others UCs have these problems too"" is weak at best. Even if that was true, it proves that UCR sucks as the the other schools make up for it with robust opportunities, strong reputations, and more desirable locations. 

""UCR does have a lot of opportunities"" is an incredibly laughable statement. The only decent opportunities available here are the ones you can get at any other UC. UCR has nothing special to offer. My major literally has an internship requirement, and so many students struggled to find anything because UCR is an opportunity dead zone. You are trying to say UCR has the same opportunities as UCLA, UCSD, UCI etc.? Basic data on the economic situations of these cities will tell you this is not true. Also, compare the companies/organizations that go to career fairs and recruit at the different UCs... it's a night and day difference and UCR gets the short-end of the stick.

Anyways, it's interesting I received so many downvotes when I based my criticisms on objective measures, and I even linked a source. Meanwhile, people who replied to me praising UCR with no sources, objective measures, or anything like that get up voted. Saying ""other UCs have this problem"" isn't proving anything.

He runs an organization whose main focus is helping guide college/high school students toward the conservative viewpoint. Engaging with any willing participant on college campuses seems to align very well with that goal.

Do not allow him to ask you questions to control the direction of the conversation. If he answers your question with a counter gotcha question, answer him with something like, ""You obviously don't want to give a genuine answer to my question, so why don't you just get to the point you want to make, and stop pretending to be interested in an honest exchange."" He is very little more than a walking talking strawman fallacy, so your goal is not to have fair conversation, your goal is to show his audience that he is less informed than you are.

If what you’re saying is true, then he wouldn’t stand a chance. It’s like knowing a cheat code because you know right where he’s going to go exactly when he’s going to go there.

You're either playing dumb for the sake of argument or are legitimately an idiot. 

Yes you're right about that! The people who were up there speaking weren't the brightest. Unfortunately, A.) the same people who fall for the trap are usually not the left's smartest. That is the reality of any group and to characterize an entire group off of a small sample size comes with all of the fallacies of generalization. B.) As many posts about KirKK have pointed out, TPUSA heavily moderates who is allowed to come up to speak. When people with rational arguments or difficult questions come, TPUSA will not let them up. They have zero problem with letting the younger, less articulate people go up though.

There have been letters written to the police department which claimed they were “The Zodiac Killer” and responsible for Cheri Jo Bates murder, but the author was identified through DNA testing and admitted that he was not the killer of Cheri Jo Bates nor was he the Zodiac Killer. There has been a letter written describing the undisclosed events which surrounded her murder, and a desk which had an eerie poem written beneath it eluding to murder. The desk was discovered in an RCC warehouse and the letter was confirmed to be fake, written by the same person identified through DNA. The inscription written into the desk is written similarly to the Zodiac Killer’s letters, but it’s still unproven if there’s a connection and the Riverside police department/cold case unit believe they know who killed her, although there is insufficient evidence to charge them or place an arrest.

However:

&gt;*In addition, the RPD have noted similarities between Bates’ murder and the general modus operandi of a fatal attack upon a young couple committed at Lake Berryessa in September 1969—an attack conclusively ascribed to the Zodiac.*

For certain states  it's an instant felony and jail time/legal fees/costly probation.

Guns should not replace using your brain. If you're going to a bank, don't go in the ghetto. If you have to go in the ghetto, go inside and don't park in front of the bank. If you feel something sketchy somewhere, leave the area. Find people you're comfortable to be around.

Also, the people who suggest getting a CCW permit are way overreacting (which often leads to unnecessary violence). Get a small baseball bat and keep it in your door pocket if that will help you feel safer. They work for self-defense and are a deterrent (my mom lives in a state with few gun control laws and her business partner was able to disable a potential carjacker with one and a right hook).

What percentage of Americans were down for the war the day after 9/11?

&gt;Never mind that 42% want to eradicate every man, woman, and child.

This is absolute bullshit and classic Jew hating blood libel. But let’s talk about anti Jewish sentiment in your family and across the entire Arab world. Let’s talk about the anti Jewish sentiment baked into Christianity and Islam since in order for those religions to even exist their story needs to start with how Jews were bad and so god changed his mind.

&gt;Never mind that Palestinians are not allowed to have a military and they live next to a well armed genocidal terror state.

Palestinians have a strong military in Jordan, which is part of the region known as Palestine and majority Palestinian. 

&gt;Nah, they should just roll over and let the Israelis commit their genocide.

In 1949 there were 60,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Now there are 2 million. There are more Arab Palestinians living in the region now than ever before in history. Jews in Israel are allowed to convert to Islam. Arabic is for all practical purposes an official language. 20% of Israel’s population is Palestinian with full civil rights.

Meanwhile, in the Arab world apostasy is a capital crime, honor killings are rampant, there is literal African slave trade as well as kefala legalized servitude. Hundreds of languages cultures and religions erased and lost in exchange for Arabic and Islam. And you call Jews the genocidal ones.

There are currently still 2 million less Jews in the world than in 1939 but I guess you’re happy about that. If only we would all just roll over and die there would be peace throughout the Middle East and Europe.

Maybe my family and I should just move back to Iran right? We’ll be REAL safe there. Except for that time they forced my entire community to convert to Islam in Mashhad and we all had to larp around as religious Muslims to avoid being killed. But hey look at these genocidal Israelis with their lack of death penalty and their freedom of religion.

Can you believe how these savages treat Palestinians? I heard last year more than 50% of Israeli medical school grads were Arabs. Such apartheid. Such genocide.

Yes, all the Palestinians need to do is roll over and die and this can all be over, why didn’t the Palestinians think of that sooner?

Never mind that 82% of Israelis want to ethnically cleanse and annex all of Gaza.  Never mind that 42% want to eradicate every man, woman, and child.
Never mind that Palestinians are not allowed to have a military and they live next to a well armed genocidal terror state.

Nah, they should just roll over and let the Israelis commit their genocide.

Subject: Protect the R’Garden – A Vital Educational and Community Resource

Dear Dean Atkinson,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Full Name], and I am a student at UC Riverside writing to express my concern about the potential closure of the R’Garden. I strongly urge you to support the continuation of this essential space that has served as a living classroom, sustainability hub, and vital resource for both students and the broader community.

The R’Garden is far more than just a garden — it’s a place where students engage with real-world issues like food insecurity, environmental justice, and sustainable agriculture. It has provided countless students with experiential learning opportunities, research platforms, and service-based projects that directly connect to UCR’s mission of community engagement and academic excellence.

Beyond academics, the R’Garden fosters a deep sense of connection — to the land, to local food systems, and to one another. It’s one of the few places on campus where students can learn about sustainability in action, contribute to local food access efforts, and feel empowered to make a difference.

Shutting down the R’Garden would mean losing a space that embodies the values of equity, environmental responsibility, and community partnership that UCR proudly upholds. I ask that you stand with students and ensure that the R’Garden remains protected and supported.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]

I wasn't able to find ANY sources outside of biased and uncredible reports displaying anything at all related to an excessive increase in human trafficking at the border under Biden, and didn't see anything even among those spewing a 400% increase. What I did find was this: Bidens border policy wasnt pro child trafficking, and a break down as to what his policy actually was: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/jun/20/donald-trump/president-joe-bidens-border-policy-is-not-pro-chil/


Fentanyl is infact an issue, one that is not partisan. The vast majority of fentanyl transported into our country are brought in through legal channels, most often US citizens atleast according to our legal data: https://www.kff.org/quick-take/most-sentenced-for-trafficking-fentanyl-are-u-s-citizens/#:~:text=But%20most%20fentanyl%20is%20being,those%20lawfully%20present%20and%20undocumented.

As for your comment on those being illegally deported to an El Salvador torture prison... you're gross. Due process is a right everyone under our jurisdiction has, and deserves. I think you need to understand that WE DONT LIKE BIDEN EITHER and need to be more honest. All you are doing here is acting childish, and frankly, it's incredibly dishonest and disrespectful. Assuming OP is saying the illegal deportation is the only mistake this org has made is genuinly odd and bordering fallacious logic.",5,1745465363.0,t1_moptk6p
1k68ajg,moqa7zi,brozuwu,"First, why would two wrongs make a right lol? 

Yes, border security is complex, and yes, we should absolutely be concerned about human trafficking and fentanyl—that’s not up for debate. But raising those issues doesn’t erase the harm done to people like the man deported to a country he hadn’t lived in since childhood. Plus Trump hasn't even been in office that long for there to be a statistic like that, but it's certainly being headed towards that direction. 

If we care about safety, we also have to care about due process and basic human rights. A single wrongful deportation can mean a death sentence, and that matters. 

Additionally, not sure where you're those statistcs from, I see an increase but not by 400%. I dont agree with the previous administration for their actions that led to that increase. 

If we’re going to talk about which policies hurt everyday Americans, let’s not ignore the economic fallout of the administration’s trade war, which raised prices for American farmers, manufacturers, and working-class families. Retaliatory tariffs slammed our agricultural exports, and U.S. consumers ended up paying more for basics like appliances, electronics, and even clothing and MEDICINE. Not to mention his economic policies which thirteen noble prize wininng economists said was bad, and his tax breaks for the wealthy and increases in taxes for common Americans.

Or who could forget his botched COVID response that led to the needless death of over 400,000 US citizens

Or what about withdrawing from the climate agreement which rolled back 100s of protections nad Set the U.S. back on emissions goals, worsening long-term global climate threats that disproportionately harm low-income communities? 

Or what about his attempted ACA repeal which would affect 20 million americans without healthcare 

You can’t claim to be “America First” if your policies make life harder for Americans just trying to get by. 

I can go on and on about the things that this administration has started, like ignoring supreme court commands (what happeend to the love of the constituion?) Its not one BIG thing its a thousand medium and little things",3,1745465768.0,t1_moptk6p

Ah, so now one man matters, when in the previous comment it did not, interesting 

Since you seem to be concerned about the needless american deaths, I think you;'ll find intriguing that   
\- Insulin now more expensive  
\- Attempted ACA repealing/rolling back healthcare regulatiosn like the ACA   
\- cuts to pell grants   
\- COVID fumbling led to the death of 400k americans   
\- Tarrifs making life more difficult for americans and will make medicine more inaccessbily   
\- Stock market at an all time low   
\- Gutting of protections for marginalized communities,   
\- health care rollbacks,   
\- climate change neglect  
\- firing federal employees/gutting agencies that dont agree with him idelogically and masking it as cutting uncessesary things?

1lkfmx2,mzu42v4,Imaginary-Reward-447,"I agree it's a problem at all places, but the admin here don't support the decisions of faculty here as much as they should. I know that at UCSD they routinely, rightly fail 70%+ of their bio/engineering requirement STEM courses. The perspective is that whether it was their high school teachers or their previous instructors, someone failed  by passing them when they didn't command the material, and it's the current Professor's responsibility to hold the line. I hear of squashed coup attempts like this scenario regularly, and I wish we had their policy here.

Now UCR. I've seen some criminal practices here. I've seen Professors give away passing grades. The coloring books in the form of copy-paste exams or completely chatgpt-able courses (all online unproctored work! in 2025! at a UC!) You have to try to fail a class at this point by being the worst student you can strive to be. But it's on the faculty and college admin. I've seen other students so poor they don't understand week 1 material yet can study a copy-paste exam and regurgitate answers and ultimately pass, knowing nothing. We allow that here. We ENCOURAGE that here. We ENABLE this here.

I believe there are Professors here that interpreted ""work with a minority population"" to mean just give passing grades, they will be unemployable anyway. That's fundamentally racist in my opinion.

edit for the below comment bcs I've been banned. 

Firstly, I'm blaming faculty, not the minorities. I called it racist so I'm talking about the faculty. I'm obviously not saying the students are racist towards themselves... It's also rich that the first thing out of your mouth is ""privileged opinion."" I'm a first gen minority myself and I'm heavily involved in outreach and mentorship.

1) Yes, a lot of ppl were overreacting about the grading schemes and such. However, a lot of people were still very much respectful while being frustrated. 

2) Only 1 person said something about spoofing the location and they said ""if you have an android you could spoof your location to wherever btw. i have an iphone so i can't unfortunately."" They said they DID NOT spoof their location and just merely brought it up. Nobody else in the discord mentioned anything else about spoofing and no one replied to their comment anyways. You have absolutely no evidence that anyone with the issue was lying about their location. But yes, spoofing your location is bad and shouldn't be encouraged. 

3) Being brushed off by Buldoc saying ""you should have went to IT"" when there is no way to track your current pollev grade and having to ASK for your pollev grade is unacceptable. There was no way to tell that your check-ins were not being counted properly. Especially when according to the ppl having issues, they had no idea that there was issues in the first place. The least that could be done is an investigation to see if this is a larger issue/mistake. 10% which was the weight of the participation grade, is a lot and pass/fail worthy.

@immediate talk

 ***Don’t fall for this he literally made the petition and trying to organize some sort of defamation echo chamber in the chat***

1.	⁠So let me get this straight…

telling Bolduc to go f* himself  calling him a bitch for being a millennial, saying he’s trash” and “terrible”, all the other lies like him posting as a redditor or paying RMP reviews is what you guys consider a respectful .

Some of you were even joking about totaling his car. Yeah, totally normal behavior for people who just want a fair grade right?  That’s not even half of it too lol

2) You can delete messages all you want, but it doesn’t erase the fact that multiple people openly admitted they weren’t attending lecture as per poster, but I guess they’re lying cause it’s against you?? Lol  !!

Also you’re acting like it’s the system’s fault? You don’t have any proof you didn’t spoof either or the other guy did.You just expect professors to take your word after you lied about showing up  You really think it’s not suspicious that suddenly a bunch of people with low grades showed up but somehow didn’t check in? Or that they keep listing other grievances on why they didn’t fail and how bolduc just messed up on everything. Seems kinda weird that everything is his fault.

3)PollEv works, it’s used systemwide. Issues didn’t magically appear this quarter. It didn’t magically discriminate towards the lower grade people either. If your check-in failed, it’s because you weren’t there. There’s literally no widespread technical failure reported, I haven’t had issues in previous courses at all for the location.   No one forced you to ignore it until the final week. If this is your argument, I guess all canvas submissions or other online submissions that didn’t go through are part of technical issues so you should get a free pass. Not true when they’re completely reliable. Your guys is argument is you have 20+ answered questions, you can literally answer the question by not checking in.  There is so much other things in courses  I had that were unverifiable, Welcome to being an adult!

4) U guys in the chat are like If we all report him they’ll be forced to act and change the grade lol. Then digging for irrelevant dirt from past quarters to smear his name, trying to get people to SPAM email random admins until someone caves. Like that gets someone’s reputation on their job on the line to Potentially  get them fired. And you’re guys of issue of resolvement is a 10+% grade boost to bring you up a letter grade or for failing people to get C’s.

5) Maybe you don’t condone it, but you sure like being silent on it like the rest of the horrible people attacking him. But I guess it’s ok cause it benefits you.

You can have empathy for other calamities while having the same empathy for our own calamities. There is no need to disregard one or the other, especially when they are more interconnected than you think they are.

Can Free Gaza and Help Californians not both happen? Can bad people and good people both burn? Can rich and poor not both suffer? You can't selectively choose what to have empathy for and then claim that having zero empathy will be the end of us all, because the same can be said about you from the other side of the globe, all it takes is a shift in perspective. If you really want to be better than those who are dismissing the fires, be different and acknowledge that both are bad and seek to remedy the situation instead of trying to appear justified by saying shit like POC and non-POC. We are all humans and people, that distinction is literally why we have selectivity in who we choose to be empathetic with.

I totally agree—unless you’re aiming for a hyper-competitive STEM field at a top-tier institution like UCLA or Berkeley, the name of the school matters far less than people think. What’s more important is what you do while you’re there: your GPA, your research experience, your network, and your growth. UCR, UC Merced, and other so-called “lower-tier” UCs still offer incredible opportunities for driven students.

It’s also eye-opening to hear how admissions committees function. A lot of people assume tenured professors are combing through every application, but the reality is much more bureaucratic and imperfect. That really reinforces your point that students shouldn’t base their self-worth or academic future on admissions outcomes alone.

A few weeks after this getaway stopped doing no ID Wednesdays.

1k5qx1a,mpmvwgw,BigBuseroni,"Considering we did a case analysis on this business here's my two cents as to why:

A. Due to both lack of funds and lack of investment, the place has seen better days, long away are the days that this place resembled a proper dive bar/grill. This has definitely caused issues with the increasing expectations of the incoming students 

B. Covid started the downfall as the culture was disrupted for a prolonged time that led to the decline of popularity. 

C. There has been pushback from the campus itself in regards to supporting the business flourish as there were hikes in rent which put a strain on the relationship between both businesses. It is also stated that a possible conflict of interest was introduced when UCR began heavily funding the Barn. 

It truly is a shame, but we also have to take into account all these factors and realize that current students in general don't cherish the business as much as previous alumni once did.

Copy Pasted:

Special feature with collaboration from The Highlander. ""It was all a lie""... A student who was said to have been injured from a thrown bottle during Wednesday's grad night. Which has caused the police and paramedics to be called to the scene. Was found out that the student had been given a self-inflicted bottle wound. This is evident from footage from inside surveillance cameras in Getaway. The owner Sean, who founded Getaway in July of 1997, was given the information after the police conducted interviews of witnesses; who were then able to evaluate the conclusion of the self-inflicted wound. Yet with this evidence Getaway still faces a shutdown, where they have created a petition to get Chancellor Wilcox to help better the situation for Getaway.
""He can put a stop to everything"" said Sean, due to how he controls all operations of the campus of UCR. How Getaway is having new issues such as 60% increase in their rent bill, a no dancing policy, as well as lack of respect and benefits compared to that of the Barn. With less than 2,000 petition signatures would they be able to reach the acknowledgement of Chancellor Wilcox?",1,1745961721.0,t3_1k5qx1a

You're doing the best you can, and your best may not be the absolute best anyone can do, but its the best you can. Give yourself grace. Youve got this. And if you feel like you dont, reach out for help; reach out to your professors, go to the ARC, join study groups if you can.

1gizvsm,lva4xiw,Some_Milano_kid,"Little bit of advice. 
1. We’ve probably all heard of the 1:2 ratio of hours needed to study per units taken thing told to us at some point of time, but I can confirm that it’s pretty essential. If you do that consistently, then you genuinely won’t have to spend a crazy amount of hours studying for your exams that all occur roughly around the same time. You can get all A’s/pass all your classes without doing the 1:2 but it’s not a guarantee, so I just stick with it plus however else my professors say to study. 
2. Use office hours, study groups and tutoring at the ARC. All of this is completely free to set up and it’s best to set up a consistent rhythm for ours in these areas just for when you may potentially need help in the future and even when you don’t need help with certain concepts, at least a good review. 

Shit is hard for 80% of students when you don’t do exactly what advisors or professors tell you to do. But if you want success sometimes u just gotta sacrifice a lot of those school events to keep everything together from the gun and have your fun later when everything is truly under control and not being pushed off to the last minute.",11,1730684688.0,t3_1gizvsm

But for my major that is not the case so I have all of the draw backs and none of the benefits ha.

Also, their office hours are always packed with lil teachers pets that just sit there and take up space doing homework, or just talking about random shit with the profs trying to force relationships, If I’m there I’m there to ask specific question to learn.

Putting these into your schedule will force you to become disciplined with the rest of your time and you will have something cool to remember after college besides how scared and pressured you were.

You can get 80% of your reading done between classes and still have time to drink every night. Take a look at your screen time and you will see where most of your time went.

I didn’t really know what to do afterwards. I got an office job, 9-5, got promoted at the same job the following year, but even still, didn’t feel like I was living.

Unlike the HS graduation where you knew college was next, now you have an uncharted path facing you, which is surreal and unsettling but is also a fresh opportunity. Finding the what next is always the start of a blank chapter in the book of life. Believe in yourself and the accomplishments you have achieved.  Transitions in life are a struggle even those that 'should be' celebrated. The university wasn't just about the classes, but the routine, the connections made, a sense of belonging. The feelings are natural because you had meaning and identified as a student. You are something more and shifting to this reality is going to take a bit of time.  Graduating from university is an amazing accomplishment, and the degree can never be taken from you. There is so much ahead and you're standing on the edge of new freedom.

Regardless of your future plans, graduating isn't really a beginning or an ending, it's a transition, a shift from a predictable routine that you had become familiar with, to a new routine, with new rhythms and patterns.  It will take time to adjust to them and to make your way through the ""new normal.""  Be kind to yourself in the meantime, and you will figure this out.

1kolc13,msu7nah,LordHelix9,"The opposite for me. 

The first time I applied to UCR I didn't get in. I took a lot of AP classes I wasn't prepared for. The UC system uses an unweighted GPA system for admission so I was competing with people who coasted in Gen Ed courses whereas I was lucky to even get a C in classes that were given the same value for GPA.

I eventually got in after spending time at a community College but I wasn't proud of it. When asked by people I met I always said something along the lines of that it was a cost saving thing or that I had a moral opposition to the cost of public universities partially funded by tax money and that I wanted to spend as little money there as possible. I knew it was a lie. I simply thought that I was a fraud. I truly believed I wasn't smart enough to get into ""the joke of the UC system.""

There was one night after class during this past fall quarter when I didn't really feel like going home quite yet and just sat at the bell tower. It's a really pretty structure and took in the view. I realized that going to any four year university is a privilege and that I was here. I wasn't the failure I thought of myself as back at community college.

I am proud to go to UCR. I worked to make it happen. I feel that all of you should be proud to do so as well. The feeling of not accomplishing everything you want exists everywhere. Any university will have people who think that they're not good enough and should have gone somewhere else. No one whose opinion matters will judge you for where you went to school when you get that first job with your degree.

Finals are coming up and it will work out for you. Go in with that mindset and I know you'll do fine.

1iv2x2u,mfjywqg,_ACuriousFellow_,"Many people have shared your concerns about the club known as **Christians on Campus** which operates on many university campuses across the United States and goes by various names such as **Christian Students on Campus (CSOC)** and **Christians at [University Name].**

They are affiliated with a denomination/sect known as **The Lord’s Recovery** or **The Local Churches** which was founded by a man named **Witness Lee.** These churches use the naming scheme of **”The Church in [City Name]”** (e.g. [**The Church in Austin**](https://churchinaustin.org)). Many ex-members, including many former leaders, have brought up concerns about their teachings and practices as well as serious abuses which have been covered up by leaders of that group. Those who speak up about these things have often been shamed and shunned for their efforts.

As someone who was once part of this sect and as one who served as an officer and later president in their club at UTSA, I have seen that the campus clubs were designed to funnel vulnerable young adults into their churches in order to bolster their numbers. We often made efforts to hide our affiliation with The Lord’s Recovery and Witness Lee when first encountering potential recruits so as not to scare them away, and we would only show more to those whom our leaders felt were ready for “higher truths.” 

We also made efforts to recruit freshmen orientees to our club during the orientation season. UTSA expressly forbade the recruitment of orientees, but we persisted and tried to fly under the radar because we did not want other Christian clubs reaching the new students before us. I’ve already warned the subreddit of my old university, **The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),** [**in this post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTSA/s/YhOuQEuW0l), and a student from Austin has shared their testimony as well for the campus club at [**The University of Texas at Austin.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/s/g6Ti2U3bx2) Another ex-member who was involved with the university clubs posted a video on YouTube with some concerns regarding their recruitment strategies. You can watch it [**here.**](https://youtu.be/Go4Q25Z_m00?si=hnZkigREVa9PlnT5)

Anyone who wishes to see the testimony of various other ex-members may refer to [**this article.**](https://thecuriousfellows.wordpress.com/2025/01/20/testimonies-of-former-members-of-the-lords-recovery/)

Please exercise extreme caution when dealing with this group.",1,1740889672.0,t1_me4t9oq

1iv2x2u,mfwan80,_ACuriousFellow_,"Then pray that the Lord would bring transparency to these campus clubs which are affiliated with **The Local Churches (The Lord’s Recovery)** and that the Lord would strengthen and protect those who speak up about their concerns. These things have indeed been reported on multiple campuses where the club known as **”Christians Students on Campus”** is active as well as the churches they are affiliated with.

Likewise, pray that the hearts of the members of these churches would be softened so that they would not shame and shun those who speak up and try to bring these issues to light. Many current and ex-members have been moved by the Lord to speak about these things, and it would be prudent to hear them out rather than dolling out the same harsh treatment that they’ve already experienced and have testified about.

1f8kf9o,llhym2b,ofSomething,"I take any phobic to mean to hate on a group due to choices. Asking about acceptance isn't that. Idc about Trans ppl, normal ppl, gays, whites, etc. Love and live your life. Idc. I mean that sincerely. If anything, I'm people phobic. That question, though? Can it come from a transphoboc person? Sure. But it can also come from someone like me. If you're proud of yourself, identity, and want to be accepted. How can you not be so with family?

The responses I got are... Many people feel like they'll lose the support of their family. Fair. But what support are we talking about? People such as op have answered financial and housing support. So you want your family to support you despite not agreeing with your lifestyle? Once you're 18, you're on your own. Not entitled to anything family wise. If your family disowns you, so be it. It sucks but be authentic, be yourself. Loving yourself. Isn't that a risk you have to take? Comes off as just milking the golden goose while you can then telling your family who you really are when you no longer have anything to lose. I'm not saying that's op or even entirely relevant, just thoughts. Because some people, myself included, think. We have thoughts and ideas. A desire to better understand what goes on in people's heads. The idea of I want to live as this person. Be this person. Yet, not coming out to your family or friends? Seems counterintuitive to me. So yeah, I've asked that question and will continue to do so. Because I want to understand the issue. Just like I'll ask my best friend why he goes back to a toxic female abuser. Are questions inherently phobic? No, the intention is. 

From what you wrote, I take it to mean you define phobic as anything that doesn't cater to your feelings or inversely upsets them. Because that's what phobic means nowadays. Not being against something, no. But not being for it. If you don't support unequivocally every issue of a group, you're labeled phobic. If you do not cater to the feelings with consideration of a group, your phobic. The question you stated is no different than the question you asked. Except one is emotionally charged. People converse to understand. So yeah. Language matters. 

We need to stop generalizing phobia and racism. It minimizes actual issues. Gays and Trans people are being murdered around the world. That's phobia. Not asking someone how can they expect their family to accept themselves if they can't. And especially not having a differing opinion than you. You can not support the ideologies of the movement but still respect those who live it. Our country is quite literally founded on that principal. 

We each have ideas. Beliefs. Ethics. Having one contrary to your narrative does not make a bigot, nor phobic. By the clinical definition, one must take action or expressive verbal action in disparaging a group on a discriminatory basis. Not supporting Trans emotions is not phobia. Asking questions is not phobia. Not believing in the movement is not phobia. It's about intent. Seeking to disrupt, disparage, demean, destroy, or inflict harm is. That's phobia defined. Perhaps whomever you encountered met that definition. But the question itself does not.",1,1725471332.0,t1_llhg7a2

Well, since I am a mail carrier maybe I can offer insight that way.

If you have a valid ID with your new name you can go to your home post office and forward all mail with that name to your dorm (or wherever you live).  Mail forwarding is now a 2 factor authorization to combat mail and identity fraud so they might send something to your parents house for a confirmation. If you have 2 ID, one with the old and current  address that would help alot. You can also ask the clerk to write a special notice card saying to NOT deliver any mail with your new name to this residence.

1f8kf9o,llmeb39,reigningreina,"Hi OP, not even sure why reddit suggested this post to me since I went to college out of CA (was raised there for a part though and was originally planning to go to a UC) but just a few other things to add just because I didn’t see them and I just finished uni within the last few years. I just wanted to tack some other things on as either commentary or advice on additional things you can do and might want to consider adding just to help inhibit the dispersal of your info now that you’re considered fair game in the data market as an adult. 

People mentioned having usps hold your mail. Do you go home often enough you can collect it? They will only hold up to 30 days. You can use forwarding services after that but be aware that forwarding services with USPS can normally take up to 14 days to process. So you want to immediately want to call in to make that hold request then enroll with the forwarding services asap.  Just want to make sure you are aware. 

Also, somewhere within your student website that should include bursar info, academic records for transcripts, enrollment (basing this off my brothers havjng similar websites to mine when they went to uni in CA so I’m assuming these are norms most students can access for their student logins). You should be able to see your permanent address, mailing address, international address etc. You should be able to edit that from your account if you think there is a risk that one day your school could actually send info with your lived name as well. You can set it to your current address/dorm, just remember to change it a week at least before you move from there and somewhere else, even if just home for the summer. It should process within a few days at most and you could have direct access to your mail that way. Just tell your parents you’re needed to set it to school because you needed some important school mail for enrollment or something essential sounding in case they notice a change. 

Second, as you ease into adulthood (I’m assuming you’re an undergrad based off the post, but apologies if I presumed too much on that one 😅), I’d suggest looking into ways people protect their identity online, for starters, from spam calls. The only reason I suggest so is that depending on how long you feel you may need to try to protect your lived identity for you own peace back home, information about your lived name will eventually probably become part of the data tied to you that people use for spam call, other spam mail, that  companies sell to each other. In my experience, I’ve found that using some of the federal laws to prohibit the use of my information for spam calls (google around for stopping spam calls because there’s a few fantastic Reddit posts explaining the several things you can do) trickled into other areas including getting less spam mail because it likely gets marked as useless info and canned instead of sold.  

Thirdly, I’m almost certain that CA the state has a several laws to help people’s privacy or protect them as a consumer that can be used in roundabout ways to your situation or directly. I don’t permanently reside in CA at this time and therefore dont often utilize them so I never followed up on the specific legal how to’s, but I sometimes stumble on different ways to take advantage of CA state laws to your best interest. I’d look into what state law can also do for you. I’m sure you could find some good advice, you’ll just have to do some research on how to. 

Hope this helps :)",4,1725540831.0,t3_1f8kf9o

Unfortunately, with how UCR’s lived name system works, I think this is a one-or-the-other kind of situation; either you use your lived name across the board, or your legal one. I had the same issue last year and ultimately opted out of using one, since I seemingly didn’t have a choice to configure where I did or didn’t want it to be shown. 

Don’t wanna reiterate what others said but definitely make sure you contact the correct department about not wanting physical mail! I don’t know which ones you’re getting mail from but try to reach out to them individually. I know it’s tedious but given how large a school UCR is and how many students they accommodate for, it’s best to play it safe and not be reliant on them to do all the work for you.

I speak from experience being from a toxic high school in the Bay Area : all of these feelings will disappear once you finally get into college and start interacting with the people around you—they hold no judgement and many of them have rejected top tier programs to be here because of cost and location.  People don’t realize they live in a bubble until they leave that bubble. 


 I would definitely channel these frustrations into developing yourself, your career, and succeeding regardless of which college you’re going! UCR is a genuinely powerful program that serves the local area in huge ways, and you should be honored that you go to a college that has genuinely improved so many people’s lives. 


all in all, don’t focus on other people’s emotions on your success, build your own. I will guarantee that your college does not define your success, and it often is a bullshit ploy for people to make themselves feel better because they aren’t at the top rung themselves.",165,1745256758.0,t3_1k4ixl0

However!

I got in for winter quarter/spring semesters at 

CSU

-Chico

-Northridge

-Fullerton

-San Diego

-Long Beach

I could’ve chosen my original choice Long Beach, but I chose Riverside, the city, for more personal reasons. My sister had to do boarding school here in Riverside, because it was one of two only schools for the Deaf available in the entire state. So Riverside had some personal meaning to me and I know it better than the other schools. UCR was also the only school that gave me the Transfer Regents Scholarship and the place I moved into was affordable and private for me. Can’t beat that.

I was nervous and still feeling a certain way, but after being here since December 2024—I really love it. Are there some issues here in Riverside/UCR? Yes, absolutely. Are there issues at other schools/cities? Yes.

You go where you truly want to go, need to go, and is best for you. Do NOT let somebody else decide things for you-especially on where you pick and go to school to. It’s your life. If you’re happy and proud to get into and SIR’d to UCR——Then accept it and keep moving forward.



Besides. It’s not the only school and you could always choose to go to another school for something like grad school/ professional school.

Her friend going to CC doesn’t really understand the transfer process, and I think all of it is a way to get her to stick around so she has someone to hang around with.

1k4ixl0,moehzzo,Puzzleheaded_Face441,"As someone who graduated from UC Berkeley and later came to UC Riverside for graduate school, UC Riverside definitely is friendlier and warm compared to how cutthroat UC Berkeley is. You may get the prestige, but if you don't do well enough (get high enough GPA), it doesn't matter. So the question becomes: can you get a 4.0 GPA in UCR when you would have gotten a 3.6 or less at UCB? If so, go to UCR. The prestige won't carry you if your grades, work ethic, and experience is ordinary.

The prestige does matter to some extent, but you can make up for it if you put the extra effort into doing extracurriculars or school projects. It really is the amount you put in is the amount you will get out of school. 

I also have a friend who went to Google with a UCR undergraduate - so honestly, if you are a good student, it really doesn't matter that much where you went. 

So, just don't go with the ""Cs get degrees"" mentality and you generally will be fine when you go off to the real world.

Also, in terms of atmosphere, I definitely would choose UCR over UCB. It is rare that you would ever trust your classmates in your classes or make friends with them. Even if they were friends, I've heard of stories of them backstabbing you when it came to missing things in classes. Even the friends I made there were not really lasting.

I apologize for the nasty remarks about north cal people that's just my stereotype and opinion. Also the school is beautiful tbh the buildings are mostly all new and it's growing alot. The gym is amazing, the weather is funky but can be very nice, the sunsets are great and there's many cool spots nearby if you ever wanna leave campus but you need to drive a good amount.

1k4ixl0,n3xaonp,Weird_Government2132,"I think you probably know this at some level, but the response you got from your friends is just an honest reflection of how people, in general, perceive UCR. It's just the reality of how people who aren't UCR-affiliated in some way regard the university. All of the validation on r/ucr will not change this. 

However, as others point out, maybe these so-called ""friends"" shouldn't be your friends. You can do better. Real friends would bite their tongue and say ""hey congrats on getting in to UCR, it's not far from L.A.!"" instead of ""why the f would you want to go to that armpit of a school with a bunch of UC Rejects?"" (which is what they're really thinking).

Honestly, feeling hurt and ashamed by how others see UCR isn't a bad thing, IF you can turn it around and use it to motivate yourself. Take an honest look at how you ended up at UCR - could you have studied more? Partied less? Enrolled in more extracurriculars? Gotten better LOR's? Could you turn it around and say now you are starting with a clean slate - can you work your a$$ off, network, excel in your classes, etc. with the goal of ""never having to end up at another 'UCR' for grad school or having to work at a 'UCR' job after graduation?"" You can easily do this. The academic standards in UCR courses are significantly lower than the other UC's. If you just show up and try, you can potentially rack up a 4.0 and transfer out in 2 yrs or even finish summa cum laude. On the other hand, if you simply want to convince yourself that UCR is actually a renowned and reputable institution, and you limit your social network to friends at UCR who also share this delusion, then you might also be very happy with this as well. Just don't leave the delusional bubble, and you'll be fine.",2,1752889857.0,t3_1k4ixl0

People who criticize and don’t see bigger pictures of things tend to not be successful. Who knows what they’ll do with their lives and you shouldn’t worry about that criticism or what your friends are up to. It’s truly good that they’ve told you that, because now you’re able to distinguish from what you value most and what types of friends you need around you.

I also found the bell tower ugly, I get its old school appeal - but given how important it is - it or the surroundings can be improved. Aesthetics matter. Plant more flowers or desert plants. Buildings are good, but need a strong bold aesthetic character that binds the campus. Also find better alumni to highlight in presentation. I am sure there are some. Highlight research activities.

Bad reputations don't just spawn out of nowhere-there is usually a lot of truth to them. UCR education is subpar compared to the other UCs, this is an undeniable truth. However, the main issue with UCR is the location and the lack of opportunities here (specifically for poli sci/public policy/pre-law). My major has a required internship, but very few can actually fulfill it with something directly related to the major because there just isn't anything here. Most people are forced to fulfill it with an unrelated on-campus job because Riveraide just doesn't have enough opportunities, and the opportunities availavle just really aren't good. Other UCs are undeniably better at preparing students for the workforce/grad school, this is backed by data from the UC system that demonstrates UCR alumni having the worst outcomes in terms of income after graduation across all majors. So yeah, you can be proud, but don't ignore what you hear about UCR because much of it is true. Listening to this and taking it seriously can help you plan to work around it, although it will be very difficult and require much more effort than if you just went to a better UC. 

As for people saying the area isn't ""that"" bad... i literally almost got kidnapped in the UCR area, and someone tried breaking into my apartment at 3am...  both events happened within the same week only a few months ago.

Being from NorCal, I've visited Riverside city itself and the nearby city of Ontario (15 minutes drive).   They are actually not too bad.  There's even a nice theatre/mall chain plus a Costco in Ontario (saw lots of affluent people hanging out there).  Traffic around Riverside also flows really nice compared to LA/Orange County.  Riverside is pretty decent actually (don't listen to haters).

As for opportunities, lots of UC Riverside alumni are drawing good jobs working for FAANG (just look up Linkedin) in NorCal.  Sometimes it depends on the person making an effort as well (and not just depending on opportunities handouts from campus prestige connections).",1,1745521443.0,t1_mobx3x2

So no, if I had gone to UCLA, I could promise you I would not have dealt with these issues. 

As far as some alumni working for FAANG, that's great for them, but I honestly doubt attending UCR actually helped them obtain that role. Unlike if they had attended UCB, where there are direct pipelines to places like that. I agree that you should absolutely make an effort for opportunities and not depend on the school's prestige alone, however, the effort you make will have to be 10x stronger than what you would have to make at other higher ranked UCs. This is supported by data from the University of California, which demonstrates that UCR alumni have the lowest average income 2 years after graduation across ALL majors.

In fact, there are many folks from even lower ranked global universities (other states or countries) that made it further than some of the brightest undergraduates from all the UCs combined.  Your rant made it sound like UCs education is that subpar that it requires their graduates that level of collusion (prestige connections) to even get hired.

As for UC stats, they don't always give the complete picture (eg not all alumnis update their UCs on their current salary/position) so take it with a grain of salt.",1,1745534339.0,t1_mouipwh

You're clearly just blindly defending UCR, which is fine. But saying literal data and evidence should be taken with ""a grain of salt"" is a cope at best. Meanwhile, people you've seen on LinkedIn should be taken as definitive proof that UCR is a good school.. give me a break. The data is not on your side, just admit that. 

UC education is one of the best in the world. However, data and rankings from several sources demonstrate that UCR does not live up to the UC name. Again, you can use your anecdotal experiences all you want, but statistics from the UC system and rankings from several sources easily prove you wrong. Its undeniable that other UCs provide better education, which employers are aware of and explains why they actively recruit from other UCs before they even consider UCR (comapre career fairs between UCR and other UCs).

It's just UCR receives less applicants compared to the other UC campuses hence it's higher admission rates.

It's alright though, I'll repeat the gist of it: a higher amount of admissions means there will be a higher amount of enrollments, especially when they are enrolling 20,000 more people than last year. This is a problem because the school is already struggling to accommodate the amount of students (not in terms of sheer size, but in terms of infrastructure, like Wi-Fi, dining, walkways in the center of campus, parking lots, academic advisors, etc...).

Since you’re so confident things are great, I attached a little glimpse of the ‘endgame’ for a lot of us. Parking’s cool, but maybe worry more about job placement. UCR’s got acceptance down, but not outcomes.

1me8vok,n6heuil,Aggressive_Tip105,"If you take fall 2024 enrollment figures, total enrollment is still pretty much lower in Riverside compared to the other UC campus.  Riverside total enrollment in fall 2024 was 26384 students (1931 acres) while Berkeley - 45882 students (1232 acres), UCLA - 47335 students (419 acres), UCSD - 44256 students (2141 acres), UCI - 37297 (1526 acres) and UCD - 40065 (3000 acres).

It's not really true that with the higher the admission rate, the school will be even more overcrowded (it actually seems the opposite from 2024 UC data and prior).  I doubt UCR will suddenly be growing another 20000 students in 2025 if they were only enrolling 26000+ annually (they also had a high admission rate in 2024 as well).

UCR actually enjoys a nicely spaced population and a better quality student/professor/TA ratio compared to other UC campuses.  The land around UCR also appear to have some opportunity for more growth.  

With that said, I agree it will be good for UCR to have necessary infrastructure in place to meet their growing student population (eg. a metro link to the university much like UCSD) to reduce reliance on student parking needs.

None of these ""debate me"" bros actually care about genuine intellectual exchange, they care about ""owning the libs"" - that's why they debate college kids at UCR instead of serious liberal or (gasp) leftist political thinkers. They're people who aren't particularly smart who are in it to generate Content where they make their opponents look stupid, which is much much easier when you're ""debating"" college kids with minimal life experience who are still forming their political identities and convictions. It's vastly harder to create viral moments of ""owning the libs"" when you're debating sophisticated political thinkers who have dedicated their lives to these subjects. That's why groups like the UCR Dems and the Democratic Socialists of UCR advocated just ignoring the whole scene, because he's not at all interested in ideas or honest debate, he's interested in being a troll to farm content.

The youtuber ContraPoints argues kind of tangentially to this in a whole bunch of her videos - if you had to distill her entire political thesis into one point I'd guess it's that aesthetics and vibes in presentation are vastly more important for persuasion than actual arguments, and people like Charlie Kirk (and Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, Jordan Peterson, the whole lot of them) are the purest embodiment of that: they gratify their audiences by being the idea of some kind of dark enlightened academics, bold crusaders for The Truth no matter how politically incorrect they may be, but, of course, in reality are universally the embarrassing display of, as you put it, ""Republican porn"" you bore witness to today.

Screaming, chanting, or insulting is not going to do anything other than fuel them.  If you ignore them, they will probably leave as they either want to debate or display the ""lunacy"" of a college lib.  If you choose to engage, you should probably be prepared and keep your composure, they have sources (valid, fake, biased, misinterpreted, your pick) and ""just because"" almost never stands up against sources.

I'm so sick of this shit.​",3,1745760757.0,t1_mowtyot
1k6ar5f,mpcxoil,Candid_Source_6091,"They quite literally will?  It costs money to get here, no discussion means no content, no content means no money, no money means they cannot make it here.  And most republicans are not white supremacists.  The majority would rather have every race/ethnicity thrive and be successful productive citizens, but circumstances in US history and immigration have made it difficult for some groups to do so.  Republicans just believe we should take a different approach.

One of the people speaking was Gothix, on her channel she commented that the poster asking, ""Do black lives really matter?"" was meant to question whether the country was actually taking the proper measures to uplift the black community.  They personally believe that it should be handled differently, and lowering things like policing is not going to really help.  Democrats have not done a good job on easing racial relations (polls show Obama worsened them and Biden does not seem to have done much better).  This isn't to say that Republicans have been successful either, the point is that one side does not have the perfect solution.

As to close minded bullshit, Republicans hold conservative and old-fashioned values, now ask yourself, how has America operated for the majority of its history?  The answer is these values.  To say that those are ideas are bullshit makes you very close-minded.   In addition, this idea that Republicans are this looming threat is ridiculous.  They are a loud minority, liberals are the majority, the people who were on our campus were punching up on our ideas, not down.

My personal stance is that we should look at both sides and actually observe what they have to say.  I was hoping to hear actual discussion but was met with mindless protest.  I do not believe republicans and their ideas should be taken into account as those ideas literally propped America up for centuries.  Also, MAGA and Trump are not representative of Republican, conservative, or Christian ideals.  America has been falling apart socially for a while, partially evident in the aforementioned increased racial tension in Obama's presidency.  Obama, a democrat, was expected to help America, but his efforts were lacking.  Trump came in guns blazing offering a group of people real change and to fix these issues, but it was evidently a manipulation tactic to get into power.  Like I said in my original post, these people are misinformed and want to actually make America great again, but they've been manipulated and fed lies.  They are not going to stop existing; our best bet is to provide facts and approach them with understanding and patience.

Edit:  Your reply was not very nice.  I have tried to be polite here and you resorted to name calling instead of actually discussing anything.  I have not said anything against any group of people and have condemned the MAGA movement as being a product of a narcissistic billionaire with no political experience manipulating a worried group of people by exaggerating their fears, lying, and making empty promises of reform.  I'm saying that certain issues are more nuanced than others and are not so black and white.  If you believe that that your ""side"" is fully correct on every single issue and are not even open to hearing and discussing opposing opinions, you are in fact close minded and bring shame to what is supposed to be a place of higher learning as a student.",1,1745780690.0,t1_mpb68ap

1gkt6wy,lvocw7u,Combat_Commo,"Baffled to be honest. California has been blue for a long time so it's almost always a given when it comes to the POTUS election.

However, when I was standing in line at the city civic center today, this old man of Mexican descent was behind me with his either daughter or maybe granddaughter, he could barely speak any English. Then these other early 20-ish Latinos showed up and they were saying ""puro trump"" meaning essentially, ""let's go trump."" These younger dudes could speak both English and Spanish and after the old man heard them say that, they all started talking about how they were going to vote for trump.

Now, why is this baffling to me? I've mentioned before here that I am not a young gun like most UCR students, so I grew up in the 80's and 90's. Back in the 90's, we had a governor called Pete Wilson and a mostly red house and state assembly. Back around the mid 90's, they introduced Proposition 187. This measure was heavily targeted towards illegal immigrants that were of brown skin. Essentially, if anyone even suspected you of being an illegal immigrant, you could be rounded up against your will. California does have a dark history when rounding up immigrants indiscriminately and not just of Mexican descent, but Japanese as well during WW2. Were any Americans of German or Italian descent rounded up and put in camps during WW2? Of course not, they always target non-white immigrants. 

So, this old man behind me was definitely subjected to Prop 187 from back then and yet, he willingly voted for a knowing racist man that has said heinous things against Latinos from his own mouth. Even my own mom who came here illegally but is now a citizen has continuously voted for trump as well as my sister but at least for them, it's a matter of pro-life vs abortion since they are institutionalized Catholics. I also have another cousin who is a permanent resident alien since the 80's here, who is also pro trump although he cannot vote. And I will say it sounds pretty ironic to hear my non citizen cousin blame all of America's problems on immigrants...

I've been saying it on other platforms forms for quite sometime now. I think Democrats just expect minorities to vote blue since they've been doing that for decades and republicans were always seen as devils and in my opinion, that they are after all the crazy things they have said and done.

I'm also a Veteran and republicans have attempted to cut our benefits in the past but yet, most Veterans continue to support them...make it make sense lol

I think the real issue here is that most people just dont know the policies and vote for whoever their candidate hates.  So why even bother talking about policy? trump spent virtually no time talking about his policies at his events and yet, here we are.

But, I digress, in short, it's baffling to see Latinos that were once subjected to Prop 187, now willingly vote for republicans.",104,1730882148.0,t3_1gkt6wy

Granted, every case may be different, I came from a very poor family and my parents only had a 3rd grade education since that's the highest level their Mexican rancho could offer. I agree there are certain sub-biases that exist here. 

Even my sister who had previously voted against trump mentioned that she didn't like Kamala which surprised me. I asked her why and she said ""because I saw a video on tiktok."" So I was like are you serious? This just proves to me that even some Latino woman were against Kamala based on nothing really other than perhaps the fact she was a woman. Even my own wife, who is a permanent resident and hates trump, said she wasn't sure if a woman could do the job because of menopause and such...

My sister is not college educated and my wife grew up in Mexico so she only finished up to 9th grade because her machismo grandfather, which she grew up with along with her grandmother, wouldn't let her go to high school because he was afraid she'd find a boyfriend. Neither are college educated but also do not make any attempts to figure things out for themselves in this case, it's like they're prisoners in their own minds I really don't know.

If I hadn't been such a rebel growing up listening to Rage Against the Machine or being such a huge Nirvana fan since Kurt Cobain was very pro-woman, I'd probably be machismo too.

America is too uneducated to know what its best interests are, and that may be its undoing. I also heard recently that Military recruitment is really low now so America really needs to take a look in the mirror and find itself before it's too late!",10,1730888793.0,t1_lvojec3

She was the lowest rated Vp in history. She was NOT voted to be the nominee, and if there was a primary she would never have won it against any average democrat. 

And what you said in your last comment says everything that needs to be said. 

It’s not because she is the most unlikable, least genuine example of a presidential candate- who NEVER did interviews outside of heavily edited scripted interviews. And it couldn’t be that she spent the entire campaign calling half the country practically Nazis and her buddy Biden calling Americans garbage. Or the fact that she never appeared to moderates, libertarians, or independents. 

No, the reason she lost is because American is sexist and racist. 

No, they voted because she’s a terrible example of a fake politician and people are tired of the race baiting. 

ANYONE with half a brain knew she was going to lose. 

And I’ll get downvoted for this because it’s the truth, but democrats don’t like it.

Kamala Harris was the worse. … and I mean the WORST choice.

1. She’s a woman and Trump immediately calling her race into question to discredit her amongst people who have labeled her a liar (Sexist and racist America, I know. We’d rather have  convicted felon than a woman)

2. Trump’s social media sugar baby, Elon, and the internet in general. There is so much misinformation spread about Kamala that people made their minds up before Election Day. No one wants to research things themselves. I argued with someone because they thought Kamala said something that was disproven by a simple google search. Not to mention Twitter is so full of right winged content now, you literally can’t escape it. There’s so much AI bs and cut videos that people instantly believe Kamala is this evil woman 

3. Palestine Activism/Third Party Voting. Disclaimer: I am 100% against the genocide of Palestinians. I am not fond of the third party votes, however, basically voting for Trump. I know even with those votes, Kamala wouldn’t win but my point still stands. I wish we didn’t just have two people to pick from but our hands are tied, we need to allocate our votes to one or the other. The thing that boggles my brain the most is people saying “I’m not voting for Genocide!” And then they vote Trump like?? He doesn’t care about the Genocide and will keep letting it happen. Kamala has been vocal about being against it happening and has wanted an end to the war. 

4. People fumbling the voting system: I’ve seen a lot of people either genuinely not registering to vote or putting “funny and silly” things on their ballot for TikTok views and it’s lowkey very annoying. Some people straight up didn’t vote which was 10 times more annoying. 

5. Ballot error/ballot burning. Not saying this is any one groups fault but why are we burning ballots like at all?? The candidate you want has votes in there too, why burn them and screw up the numbers again?

She spoke like she was speaking to children. She was untrustworthy, disliked and her credibility not to mention intellect was often questioned. 

She and Biden Admin undermined the real issues, often times side stepping to more minor issues they can fix at the moment. There was no clear path to what she was going to do to fix America.

Liberals kept pushing the narrative that Trump and his supporters were racist but people who thought logically saw through that rhetoric. He may not have a filter, but he’s not a racist. He tells is like it is and that’s what Americans want to hear now. People want to throw that word “racist” or “racism” without even understanding what that word is these days.

Yet, as I reflect upon the fruits of labor seized and squandered in the form of taxes, I am compelled to question the wisdom of those who clamor for ever more. When a person of modest means rises to prosperity, they see all too clearly the folly and wastefulness that often mars our government’s use of hard-earned wealth. I do not propose we forsake the public good, but rather that we root out the waste within it. Surely, there are stores untapped, funds mismanaged, programs bloated. I recall, for instance, an audit of UCLA, which had accumulated vast sums while still demanding more in the form of rising tuition. All the while, this institution owns properties around the school and reaps revenues untold, and yet still asked more of its students.

There are those here who accuse Trump of racism without reckoning on truth. Consider, if you will, Vivek Ramaswamy, a man of Indian heritage, he stands allied with Mr. Trump, a man of complex character, yes, but not the caricature drawn by his adversaries. How absurd the notion that one who stands against illegal crossings at our borders should be deemed a racist! Rather, he stands, as he has said, for an orderly nation—a nation that knows who comes and goes upon its soil, that it might safeguard its people and its peace. Immigration, he supports; unlawful trespass, he does not.

I ask, what have those at the helm of California wrought? Once a land of promise, now a land many cannot afford, its people driven to despair as corporations depart. While some despise these enterprises, we cannot deny the livelihoods they provide, nor the taxes they yield. California, once in surplus, now finds its coffers barren, Newscum has spent without thought of the morrow. And some, rather than look to their leaders, cast their blame upon Trump, though he was but four years in office, a brief chapter in a much longer tale of power and privilege, of interests entrenched and unchanging since the days of the Clintons. This, perhaps, is the swamp Mr. Trump speaks of—a deep state, old in power and resistant to the change he brought, or sought to bring.

Look upon the old Republican Party—it lies as a relic, its neocon heirs now finding shelter among the Democrats. Figures such as Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney, Mike Pence—once hawks of the right, now find strange comfort beside Kamala and the Democratic Party. That party, once the voice of the common man, has grown a strange alliance with the giants of commerce, with big pharmaceutical powers, with engines of war. And where has it left the working man, who now finds voice among Republicans, who once stood as his adversaries?

That was rock bottom, the economic standpoint of the nation was at a point where we had nowhere to go but up. It was over 20,000 when he left office in early 2017. The Dow is at 43,700 now. I would say the economy is booming. If you make 10% interest a year, your money doubles every 7 years, correct? The Dow is up 700+% in just 15 years. Those who are invested, see the profits. If inflation is +2% a year, and the Dow has returned 46%/year, over the last 15 years, why are people “suffering”?

But these things didn't seem to be much of a priority in the debates - it seemed everything but those two questions was on the table. Trump seemed pretty stressed about the wars, saying how terrible they were and how he would end them. But the Biden team seemed pretty nonchalant about them. That may have struck a chord with some people. 

So what were they talking about in the debates? Instead of talking about things that the Federal government would be directly involved with (wars, climate change), they were talking about internal US affairs. Maybe some people don't care as much about internal US affairs at the Federal level, as the states can also handle a lot of that at the state level (abortion, immigration).

Also it seems people were advocating to not vote for Trump because of how bad of a person he is. If that's all the Trump administration is attacked for, is Trump as a bad person, then it may have given the impression that the actual policies of Trump really weren't an issue - in other words, Trump is lousy as a person, but his policies may not be that bad (since he's being attacked as a person, a lot more than his policies are being attacked).
