This also became one of his excuses to use the police. If the organizers did agree to the chancellor's request, then I think this action goes against their original intentions. Second, I object to you simply labeling this behavior as fascism. I think you do not understand what fascism is. Rather, such an anti-Israel movement is likely to develop into an anti-Semitic movement. It's fascist. Third, I think my campus life has been disturbed. I feel that such a large camp may bring security risks, and this behavior is not authorized by the school. Fourth, as the chancellor said, in March the school organized a demonstration in support of Palestine with more than 2,000 people. Obviously, this time was far less than 2,000 people. If you really want to support, you can demonstrate every day instead of building A campground with such a huge safety hazard. Fifth the chancellor twice sent letters hoping for a peaceful cessation. Apparently, many people did not know the meaning of the word ""bottom line."" Arrests and forced demolitions began two days after these letters were sent.

1ciwnkt,l2csckp,insanelygreat,"Got me curious:

40% of the money allocated for Sun God goes towards security.[^1](https://ucsdguardian.org/2023/05/22/the-downfall-of-sun-god-festival-and-asce/) That would mean ~$365k on security in 2023.[^2](https://web.archive.org/web/20230921012213/https://as.ucsd.edu/DownloadDocument?id=1436&amp;view=True)

I'm sure some of that goes towards crowd control, fencing, and EMS. But even with that considered, $365k seems like a *lot* of money for one night. Say it costs $120/hr per security person. $120k gets you 100 security people for 10 hours which seems like a lot.

I'm just an alum, but y'all should request a breakdown of spending for prior Sun God festivals from the CFO. If that's not readily available, it raises some other concerns.",124,1714711651.0,t1_l2c3ohg

1cne5z4,l36ps4p,Sand20go,"1)  I would support an actually effective protest.  So protest at the office of the president (and probably more importantly CALPERS and CALSTRS).  I think the current protests are actually pretty silly because UCSD (or any of the affiliates) have minimal power over investment decisions.  This is all out of Oakland (and Regents).  Again, rather than have a camp out on Campus go to a regents house and chain yourself to their mailbox. 

1.5)  I am not a fan (at all) of the masks.  To me it ignores much (everything) about one of the key things non-violent protests....a willingness to personally sacrifice for something you morally believe in.  Guess what - we knew who the freedom riders were.  It feels highly performative rather than effective.  And I woudl suggest that your intended audience feels precisely the same way.  Happy to discuss all the ways this varies from otherwise effective social protests.

3)  I find the protestors arguments farically simplistic (Manichean to use a word you should know).  Why I think the more moral stance is to call for disinvestment from BOTH sides until they figure out a pathway toward lasting peace.  

4)  And the disvestment supporters need to really grapple with the important differences between SA and Isreal.  South Africa was (is) an export oriented state with strong demand for capital.  Disinvestment struck at the core, for example, of SA resource extraction industries.  You should grapple with that the most radical and rabid folks in Bennies coalition believe in austere retreats from the global economy.",7,1715201423.0,t1_l36nyy1
1cne5z4,l38l7p3,AweshockArsenic,"I just fundamentally disagree with most of your points.

1) There are 2 main parts I disagree with here. The first is that this protest is not effective, but the one you suggest somehow would be. While I agree any singular individual event hosted on campus is largely insignificant, protests themselves are a game of optics. How much does the university feel it can get away with without functional repercussions. To that end I would say that you have to consider the feasibility of events as well. When you're talking about protesting outside of the office of the president or Oakland or things, how many people do you realistically think could or would go to a protest like that? I would personally say that something like 1,000 people turning out on every UC campus is much more impactful as a media statement than 2,000 people turning out in front of the office of the president. I also disagree that even effects to UCSD would be meaningless, UCR reached some level of agreement, which while nowhere near the end goals of the movement as a whole, have some impact.

1.5) This to me is just wrong. First, people are making sacrifice to participate. From the threat of arrest and university consequences to the actual action on them, people have faced repercussions already, so to make the claim that somehow wearing a mask removes this idea of sacrifice makes no sense to me. Additionally, I can see a lot of value to wearing a mask. It mitigates a lot of threat from outside actors (counter protestors or other spectators) from causing non-state related consequences (harassment online, at work, getting doxxed, etc.). It also is just beneficial to the health of the organization. This is a crowd of a lot of people in tight spaces, limiting the spread of disease means that there will be more people who are feeling healthy and up to participation in the future.

3) My personal opinion is that people who make claims about ""both sides"" fundamentally misunderstand the situation. This is not a conflict between two equal or even close to equal powers, this is an occupation. While I could believe in repercussions for members of occupied territories who commit war crimes, the power dynamics and actions in this situation are so extremely one sided. I also think in this specific case, the ""both sides"" arguments fall flat because of the means of investment. Most aid to Palestine from the US is humanitarian aid, while the aid for Israel includes a significant amount of military aid.

4) While I agree that the divestment may not be a significant blow monetarily to Israel, it's also again about the optics of it. The more people and institutions which take action about the situation encourages others and sways public opinion. The end result of this is hopefully changes on a national level to the exports and military support of the genocide. Divestment is the means by which institutions like UCSD could have impact, but universities nationwide taking action against it can sweep public opinion and result in policy and national action changes.",5,1715228778.0,t1_l36ps4p
1cne5z4,l38mr7z,Sand20go,"1. Is it? It just feels like the current response is ""students will student"" and the inconveinces to the university are minimal.  Even commencement is generally unimpacted.  Occupy RiMAC. That would cause a stir.

Moreover, I watched a BUNCH of the news coverage on this as well as the UT.  Really the demands were generic. The failure to have a spokesperson who was able to articulate demands was tell.  Contrast with (and I offer this as constructive criticism) Mario Savio and the entire Free speech movement.  What they wanted was clear, was in the universities power and consistently articulated.

3)  ""Additionally, I can see a lot of value to wearing a mask. It mitigates a lot of threat from outside actors (counter protestors or other spectators) from causing non-state related consequences (harassment online, at work, getting doxxed, etc.).""

But that is the point.  Being afriad of ""doxing"" or ""harassment"" is weak sauce. Be a proud marcher on the Edmund¬†Pettus Bridge.  I would argue that far more than marching across the bridge was the COURAGE of John Lewis and his peers, or  James Meridith or Mamie Till-Mobley.  That is what moves hearts - not protesters living in tents.  That is why at least I see this as largely performative. Thats OK. I protested for a nuclear freeze. Held hands. It was fun.

3)  Of course there are 2 sides.  Lets step back from October 7th.  There are 6 million Isreali. They are not, except in some twisted and ahistorical ridiculousness, ""occupier"".  Essentially 12 million people live in the area between the Red Sea, the River Jordan, the Golan Heights and the Mediterrian sea. A solution that doesn't figure out how to deal with that reality is no solution.

4)  I think you fundamentally miss a huge aspect of Isreali (and Jewish) poltiics and identy.  Disinvestment simply feeds, for many, a narrative that the world IS against them, that they only have themsleves to rely upon and that all the other tropes that feed isreali nationalism.  They are NOT south africa and the Afrikanners or European colonialists in the post WW2 era.  Really supporters of this movement should ask themselves the hard question - do I think those that are illegally settling in the West Bank care if Teva's share prices drop?  Probably not.  Who would are likely moderate and liberal Isrealis....who will continue to lose support to hard liners.",2,1715229634.0,t1_l38l7p3
1cne5z4,l38uwdh,AweshockArsenic,"Based on your response to 3 I think that this is unlikely to lead to a meaningful conversation. If I was unwilling or unable to recognize Israel as an occupying power and contemplate the associations that has about the power dynamics involved, then I would have different opinions about this. That being said, I'll respond to the rest of what you said:

1) While I personally agree that more action would result in more response, based on the reaction from UCSD to an encampment that was functionally unubstructive, I could not in good conscience ask anyone else to take further escalatory action. I would also say that what this protest is asking for is clear, in the universities power, and consistently articulated. If you're unaware of what they are I can explain it to you or direct you to more information about it, and if you've watched news about it but can't I might suggest that the news you're watching is not good journalism if they fail to include this messaging.

1.5) While again I personally see some value in it, and thus only wear a mask when I'm doing so for the concern of disease, I see no benefit to people facing repercussions from random counterprotestors. There is already a real threat of arrest that they are protesting in spite of, and many people are doing so without masks.

4) I think if people are unable to separate their religious identity from the actions of their government then that is a separate issue. Personal beliefs do not justify a genocide. I also want to point out that the ""moderate"" and ""liberal"" perspective is currently in support of said genocide. I don't think that caving to moderacy and and watering down perspectives is useful. And honestly I'm surprised you would say that given your perspective on the actions you suggest the protests take. Wouldn't some people also be turned away by using more ""extreme"" methods of protest?",2,1715234654.0,t1_l38mr7z

1cne5z4,l37jey8,One-Adhesiveness3140,"1.) CALPERS cannot divest because of anti-BDS legislation like AB 2844, which organizations like the UC system have more flexibility in dealing with. I do not know why you think UC Chancellors have no responsibilities in managing investments, it's just factually incorrect and I can only guess it's something you assume is true though the facts are otherwise. Part of the divestment demand is in response to insane, suppressive bills like AB 2844, which limit political action in relation to a foreign country and to highlight how backwards it is for a university to be controlled by such a stone age law.

1.5) Nobody cares about your opinions about public masking. It's irrelevant. Half of the people are masked and half aren't, and all of the students who were in the encampment showed their student IDs to admin in order for admin to issue academic violations (not to mention no attempt was made to ""disguise"" their identities when they were arrested) so the fact that you personally have an imagined issue with it is irrelevant. The relevant authorities were always aare.

3.) Can you show me where the UC Endowment funds Hamas lmao? How do you divest from ""both sides"" when the call is to divest from weapons manufacturers? What is the opposite of paying for a hellfire missile... paying for a daisy chain headband? This is ridiculous.

  
4.) Israel has billions of dollars in US funds to subsidize a weapons industry, almost the entire Israeli weapons industry is financed by the US (and was made possible entirely by US involvement.) They receive billions in outright aid annually, and much much more in US weapons industry cooperation coordinated by the state department. Not to mention o&amp;g being the last major US export segment, and crude oil futures gaining as a result of the aggression of Israel.

1clt91o,l2xusc0,squidrobotfriend,"Just did so:

&gt; Hello!

&gt; Firstly, I apologize if you received this email in error. I am sending this email to all 228 members of the Academic Senate Assembly who I could find email addresses for. Mistakes may have been made, and if you are not on the Academic Senate Assembly, you're one of today's lucky few who get this email because you share a name with someone who is.

&gt; I am writing you today to urge you to hold a vote of no confidence for Pradeep Khosla's position as the Chancellor of UC San Diego. No matter your stance on the events currently unfolding in Gaza, or the threat of similar events repeating themselves in Rafah, you must see what has unfolded today for what it is, and empathize, as you too were students once.

&gt; You have to have witnessed your fair share of student protests for causes you felt were just. You have to have felt the anger that students feel today. Seeing people fighting for good, for a cause they believe in, only for the university to turn a blind eye, or worse.

&gt; Today, it was worse. An encampment that had been, to date, entirely peaceful, turned into a scene of police brutality. Police and border patrol in full riot gear, pepper spraying students, holding them to the ground, billy clubs in hand and guns on display. The campus put into a state of lockdown and martial law, all classes forced online.

&gt; And for what? Because the encampment expanded its footprint, not as a show of aggression but as an effort of safety, due to the swelling of numbers due to the choice to cancel Sun God in an attempt to sow division among students, claiming that despite the show of force today it would be impossible for the university to provide security for Sun God while maintaining a presence of only six police officers at a peaceful protest encampment.

&gt; Forty Tritons were arrested today for standing up for what they believe in. Protest and political activism is supposed to be a core tenet of UC San Diego, naming its colleges for such figures as John Muir and Thurgood Marshall. We have to take general education classes meant to train us to be informed, politically active citizen-scholars. And yet, when it comes to it, people like Chancellor Khosla, people like Vice Chancellor Harrigan, people like Vice Chancellor Continetti, would rather have us be under-foot.

&gt; I find that this utterly fails to adhere to UCSD's standards and values for its students and faculty. I also find it absolutely abhorrent that, intermixed with the tonedeaf, threatening intimidation emails that we have been receiving all week, Chancellor Khosla saw fit to send out an email calling for 2024 Revelle Medal nominations, between his threats of unjustified violence against students. And thus I am calling on you, members of the Academic Senate Assembly, to immediately hold a vote of no-confidence for Chancellor Khosla, and if you see fit also for Vice Chancellors Harrigan and Continetti, for failing our university, its values, and most importantly its students, its most impassioned and most politically active students who best embody the spirit of being a Triton.

&gt; It is in your hands.

However, a student took a mixture of pills and died at the Village after the festival. After that, security was on lock down but to the max. Also future SGF, students werent allowed to visit IHouse if they didnt live there, no reentry, drug dogs galore sniffing for weed, shorter times, It really didnt feel safe.

Alcohol will certainly be involved in some capacity, and even if there is enough security for both individually, they will multiply on each other.

But if you are angry at this, you need to read the full details. The encampment was violating several orders to not expand. Just read the NBC article, says it right in there.

Before you call me an Israeli sympathizer, I've never supported any side of this war, nor do I personally care. In my opinion Ukraine is far more important to the security of the western world. In the region this takes place, they have had several issues and no amount of foreign intervention has helped. You need to let them solve their own problems.

the response, however, which has been a concerted effort to starve, kill, and otherwise erase palestine from the planet, fits the bill of a genocide very well. the IDF isn‚Äôt fighting the people who orchestrated the october 7th attacks or took part in it, they‚Äôre largely killing unarmed civilians who had no part in it whatsoever with the apparent goal of definitively destroying palestine and occupying its lands (pretty standard fare for a genocide).",0,1715027129.0,t1_l2uxjrm
1cllqiw,l2vrshp,nliboon,"You are right but if Hamas had the resources they would certainly engage in genocide. The way I look at it is this.

These wars had uniformed soldiers primarily not fighting in city environments and instead on battlefields. Considering Israel is fighting in a city and Hamas has no uniform and occupying apartments, hospitals, religious buildings which are against the rules of war. id say it ain‚Äôt genocide if the ration is 2:1 or even 3:1 and they‚Äôre actually statistically performing under the average. If they wanted genocide it would be 10:1,20:1 and so on. No im not supporting either side but get the facts correct. If they wanted real genocide it would be so easy. Also Hamas today captured a Jordanian US backed aid shipment that was supposed to go to the civilians which they‚Äôre making the civilians purchase from Hamas. why does the Israeli government have a system that sends alerts to Palestinian civilians before the IDF goes into the cities?

when a state actor is fighting an insurgency, they don‚Äôt get to devolve into regularly committing war crimes because it‚Äôs hard to fight an insurgency. that‚Äôs completely asinine, and we rightfully hold state actors to a higher standard; otherwise they aren‚Äôt really much better than the insurgency they are fighting. the IDF providing half-assed warnings ahead of bombings in a high density urban center where there pretty much are no safe places left is not a sufficient strategy for avoiding civilian casualties. they are airstriking civilian targets with shoddy intelligence and have no sound method for validating their targets are indeed combatants. 

further, saying ‚Äúbut if Hamas had more resources they would commit genocide!‚Äù is not relevant at all. the fact of the matter is that they dont, and that the average palestinian has no control over hamas orchestrating an attack. you‚Äôre trying to equate a hypothetical situation with the very real destruction of gaza.",1,1715028294.0,t1_l2vrshp

The population of Gaza has grown 8x and for genocide we need to look at the intentions. Do you think the IDF wants to invade Rafa just because there are Palestinians or because Hamas is still there and there are hostages? Do you think if Hamas took their weapons back and gave back hostages the IDF would still want to kill Palestinians and do you think eliminating Hamas is legitimate? Unfortunately when civilians die it‚Äôs because Israel is shooting back at Hamas but never Israel targeting Palestinians to kill Palestinians and if that does exist I condemn it. In Israel we have an Arab and Palestinians population of 20% who have full equal rights. In the West Bank/ Judea, it‚Äôs a seperate peace of land with seperate autonomy of the palestin authority and obviously those living there don‚Äôt have rights into Israel and those in Israel do not have rights there. Gaza is a separate territory and as an Israeli I don‚Äôt have rights into Gaza. For me I‚Äôd like to see all the land united.

The very fact that you think I see this as a ""trend"" is disgustingly dehumanizing to the tens of thousands of children who are actively starving to death as you chirp on the internet about how ""threatened"" you are.

Sexual intercourse (also coitus or copulation) is a sexual activity typically involving the insertion and thrusting of the male penis inside the female vagina for sexual pleasure, reproduction, or both.^[1] This is also known as vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex.^[2][3] Sexual penetration has been known by humans since the dawn of time, and has been an instinctive form of sexual behaviour and psychology among humans. Other forms of penetrative sexual intercourse include anal sex (penetration of the anus by the penis), oral sex (penetration of the mouth by the penis or oral penetration of the female genitalia), fingering (sexual penetration by the fingers) and penetration by use of a dildo (especially a strap-on dildo), and vibrators.^[4][5] These activities involve physical intimacy between two or more people and are usually used among humans solely for physical or emotional pleasure. They can contribute to human bonding.^[4][6]

Sexual intercourse (also coitus or copulation) is a sexual activity typically involving the insertion and thrusting of the male penis inside the female vagina for sexual pleasure, reproduction, or both.1 This is also known as vaginal intercourse or vaginal sex.[2][3] Sexual penetration has been known by humans since the dawn of time, and has been an instinctive form of sexual behaviour and psychology among humans. Other forms of penetrative sexual intercourse include anal sex (penetration of the anus by the penis), oral sex (penetration of the mouth by the penis or oral penetration of the female genitalia), fingering (sexual penetration by the fingers) and penetration by use of a dildo (especially a strap-on dildo), and vibrators.[4][5] These activities involve physical intimacy between two or more people and are usually used among humans solely for physical or emotional pleasure. They can contribute to human bonding.[4][6]

I'm not sure of what to say but some quick and dirty analysis shows this doesn't read like a normal English speaker or maybe even fully human? Seems like there are some poor and piecemeal translations used.

Some examples

* Odd double spacing that shows likely copy pasting instead of natural typing most likely.
* Usage of -- instead of , ; or just starting a new sentence.
* Capitalization of Email instead of e-mail or email
* October 7 instead of October 7th
* GoPro WhatsApp - very formally capitalized
* allah huakbar - ~~god is despicable? Maybe a native speaker can shed some light here. Maybe a poor translation, difference in dialects, something else?~~ See comment below
* missive - odd word to use as it is not common in english - perhaps this is a translation from another language to english?
* ""...your fellow comrades""
* Link is to the IDF youtube channel? Link if you want it: &gt;!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAFDI63yvNQ!&lt;

They do LOVE emojis though. They also do not share the same point of view as our extremely eloquent author here who backing i the IDF youtube channel which is clearly unbiased /s.

On another note many Boomer aged people remember the recognition of Israel as a Nation and the backing from the US. This was seen as majorly positive in the US from its inception in 1948 and carried thorough the decades after it. I was talking to my boomers the other day and the general conception is it was a liberated nation of people who had been completely devastated in WWII. Much of what happened during WWII to the Jews was not public knowledge until after the war and didn't come all at one, it more trickled in and it seemed the atrocities they uncovered would never stop. Hell even Schindler's list was made in 1993, which you should see if you haven't.

The perception of Israel of people this age is they are a country of victims that need our help, as this was the case when they were young. This was a perception set from youth for them and the current events challenge that belief. It will not be easy for you to change their minds on this and will be met with at best, you being ignored and at worst, an extreme level of cognitive dissonance.

Outside of boomer perception, you should look into how much we fucked up with invading Iraq in the middle east and the consequence of it allowing Iran and Syria to strengthen their relationships against the West in the middle east. Because we removed this country of strategic importance (albeit through causing a distraction by sewing chaos in the region) we now really only have Israel to rely on to push back against Syria and Iran. Keeping the Bab al-Mandab Strait and Strait of Hormuz safe for shipping is paramount to keep our Saudi ""friends"" happy and oil resources safe. With Iran becoming stronger due to the ""fall"" of Iraq this allow them to refocus their attention and threatens the Strait of Hormuz. With the war in Yemen this is already effecting the Bab al-Mandab Strait which has the Saudi's, and the west very concerned that the status quo will maintain the the region. That's not even accounting for all the shit happening in NE Africa. It a completely FUCKED situation TBH. Due to how it's played out I don't ever see the US Gov not supporting Israel and will ""turn a blind eye"" to the atrocities as long as they can.

Not saying I agree with it here, but it is a small snapshot of the political landscape in the region. It's almost like our international policy of the past 50 years in coming back to bite us in the ass.",2,1715180740.0,t1_l31k61i
1cm70p0,l309c0a,MyntChocolateChyps,"Odd spelling of the term, usually ""allahu akbar"" doesn't have the ""hu"" attached to the ""akbar"".

Translates to ""God/Allah is the greatest"". The ""hu/u"" shows up as a slight modification in pronounciation, kind of like how you drop the enunciated ""nd"" in ""kind of"" in day-to-day convos, turning instead into a version of ""kine of"".

Has approximately the same use as ""Deus Vult"" or the like outside of prayer, used as a rallying cry in wartime, but it's most often used in prayer.

They find a world famous artist they are interested in, invite them to campus to walk around for a while, then eventually choose between several artists ideas. The water fountain by the medical school in particular, is amazing. This sculpture by Kiki Smith is of her longstanding model. They worked together for decades. They both knew that the model, herself, was dying. On her back are stars that represent her astrological sign. Her arms are out to her sides a bit, turned to show her veins. These get more exaggerated as they move to her wrist, where the water comes pouring out, splashing on the stones. The site is specific to the concept driving the artwork.

1fl2v6l,lo08j2p,[deleted],"Sorry, but ya'll ain't it. But I hope you **can** be.   

I was an undergrad in 2011. We had just come off the tail end of the 2008 recession, Wallstreet getting off scott-free and our brothers and sisters in UC Davis getting pepper sprayed by campus police for demonstrating peacefully literally weeks before this. Our job market was shit, and yet school admins were making six figure salaries to shit on the hopes and dreams of us college students. They tried to cancel summer session classes. They tried to take away Sun God. We collectively said ""fuck that.""   

I was there, I'm class of 14 and something about the students at that time period just had grit. This is talked about a lot, but unfortunately there's been a lot of dampening of outbursts and outrage. I get it, you know, you all see how ""outraged"" a certain political side is and you don't want to be seen as an unhinged fanatic. 

Look up the history:  

[https://knit.ucsd.edu/tellushowucit/timeline/](https://knit.ucsd.edu/tellushowucit/timeline/)  

There's more demonstrations, protests and student-led sit-in's/walk-out's in the year of 2010-2011 than almost any 15-20 year period in both directions before or after. Some racist kids tried to have a Compton Cookout with blackface and a lot of racist undertones and we were **not fucking having it**. I sat at a lot of those protests, I remember even grabbing the microphone. We were *pissed*. We had dozens of movements over 2010 to straight *shut* that shit down. Fraternities lost their status/houses, students were suspended, many ruined their entire careers just to be the 2010 equivalent of ""anti-woke"". Doxing racists? You all just adopted it. 2008-2012 college students invented that stuff. When Trump was elected, there was a lot of activity in 2016-2018 in response, and I think the stuff we did in 2010 was an inspiration for it.  

If you're really ready to unite... I mean, thousands of you have to be willing to protest. I'm talking, miss classes, don't go to mid-terms, don't be on Tik Tok chilling, do a sit out and be firm about it. Save your phones for when they get campus police to try to squash you. They don't want the bad PR for it. Literally, your classes should be at like 20-25% attendance. Back in 2010/2011, our professors had our backs. They wouldn't fail us if we protested. But we were willing to risk it.  

I honestly feel for you all. I wish I could say we had it worse and are just better people, but it's not really the case. The truth is, we had it easier to protest... You have it harder, but you still need to do it. If any of ya'll wanna earn some money babysitting for this old man in Mira Mesa, shoot me a DM. I'll get you a meal too.",59,1726808254.0,t3_1fl2v6l

1fl2v6l,lo0vq8d,bunnyystar,"Thanks for this. I was an undergrad 2009-2013 and remember the Compton Cookout fallout. I remember the ‚ÄúMarch 4th‚Äù [day of action protests in 2010](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%E2%80%932010_California_college_tuition_hike_protests), where my non-STEM professors encouraged us to join the protests against tuition hikes and budget cuts that impacted our education (my Chicano lit prof, who was part of the UFW protests with Caesar Chavez, told us to ditch class and protest for extra credit). It was my first protest experience. 

I learned about the apartheid in Gaza from the art installations SJP put out on Library Walk, and was part of the [early divestment movement](https://againstthecurrent.org/atc165/p3930/). I remember how scary it was when UC Davis students got pepper sprayed, or when the [Irvine 11](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine_11_controversy) got arrested and charged. But the difference between then and now, is that we were more angry than we were scared. That anger transmuted into collective action. It really felt like we were the students that could change the world. 

But we couldn‚Äôt change everything. It honestly made me so proud to see all of the UC-wide protests for Gaza before they were shut down. Students have always been the group in our society that has the most power and ability to mobilize change. The main thing I‚Äôve learned over the years is that organizing is key. And frankly, organizing is so much easier when you‚Äôre a student. Even if you just find a few friends to make some flyers or posters together, that community you find will be the juice that keeps you going. Even if things are tough, know that people will always have your back and you‚Äôre never alone. Be safe out there &amp; good luck!",11,1726823375.0,t1_lo08j2p

1fl2v6l,lo5hrhg,Aromatic-Sensation,"Alum here! The 24 hour library they closed down due to budget cuts was CLICS over in Revelle. I lived in Argo my freshman year 2010 and would study and take advantage of the 24 hour library hours during finals week with all my friends. It was a hot spot to study for the Greek community too. I remember the 6am sunrises we‚Äôd watch from the entrance balcony. Not going to lie, it would get ripe in there during finals week but it was such a place of open camaraderie as we were all suffering together to pass our classes and close off the quarter. When they shut it down in 2011 we were angry and wanted to fight back. I remember protests and the forced entry of the building after the shut down. The administrators were overall pretty supportive and even kept the lights on. The CLICS building was left open for another year as a study space run by students, but that sadly didn‚Äôt last. Our little CLICS community scattered around campus and mainly Geisel. After CLICS closed and Keelings opened in Fall 2011 and I was the first class to move in, I remember the late night walks back to Revelle after a 3am study sesh at Geisel. It‚Äôs criminal that they would handicap students by taking away 24 hour study facilities that have been an integral resource for success. I hope current students fight back on the hour restrictions in libraries. You can‚Äôt pack students in like sardines on that construction zone of a campus and then take away sacred resources. 

College is one of those experiences you never forget and will feel nostalgic about for the rest of your life. The UC administration should be supporting that experience and memory not making you jump through hoops or feel fear of police retaliation when protesting.

UC San Diego Campus Notice
OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR
May 6, 2024

ALL ACADEMICS, STAFF, AND STUDENTS AT UC SAN DIEGO (Including UC San Diego Health)
An Update from Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla
Early this morning, law enforcement authorities successfully removed an illegal encampment on the UC San Diego campus after five days of attempts to communicate with participants and multiple, clear requests to disperse. UC San Diego encourages and allows peaceful protests, but this encampment violated campus policy and the law and grew to pose an unacceptable risk to the safety of the campus community. 
Sixty-four individuals were arrested after refusing the dispersal requests. Of those, 40 were identified as students and are facing interim suspension for violation of the student code of conduct. Twenty-four are either unidentified at this time or are unaffiliated with the university. Two minor injuries were reported.
Before any arrests were made this morning, encampment participants were repeatedly provided with opportunities and warnings to disperse. While many people voluntarily left the encampment, regrettably others chose to stay and be arrested. The campsite was dismantled within one hour and without any serious incidents.  
The decision to clear the campsite was made due to consideration of the significant dangers to people inside and outside of the encampment. Upon entering the campsite, wooden stakes, propane tanks, metal and plywood shields, aerosol spray cans and a sword were discovered, all of which posed unacceptable hazards for health, fire safety and security. Additionally, participants denied access to fire marshal and health inspectors, established check points and limited free access to areas of campus. These are all intolerable actions on the UC San Diego campus, which exists for the benefit of all university affiliates.
After the encampment was removed, protesters interfered with police operations, including physically obstructing San Diego County Sheriff officers and buses, blocking movement and banging on windows in an attempt to hinder the arrest process. This resulted in one additional arrest. 
Dialogue, free speech and academic freedom are cornerstones of our university. At the same time, we must ensure that Tritons, regardless of opinions and identity, have equal access to our campus and that everyone has the opportunity to work and learn in an environment free from harassment, intimidation or discrimination. We will not waver in our focus to sustain the safety, well-being and success of our campus community as we fulfill our academic mission. 
Resources and Support
During these difficult times, if you are experiencing feelings of distress or anxiety, UC San Diego has resources to support you. Students seeking immediate mental health and coping support can contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at (858) 534-3755, and faculty and staff can contact Faculty and Staff Assistance Program at (858) 534-5523.

Calling for the destruction of the only Jewish state is antisemitic. Hamas uses that phrase so maybe thing twice about co-opting it. Not to mention it is a well known antisemitic dog whistle.

Israel was reported to have sterilized Ethiopian Jews when they were brought to Israel but that didn‚Äôt happen for others. Isn‚Äôt that sounding a lot like eugenics and racism? Suspicious is it not? Just like the nazis.

There were recovered letters form a Morrocoan Jew that pleaded their family not to go there because of the racism they faced? Now why would such an innocent and progressive state make someone plead that their family not go their for their sake? Seems a bit racist doesn‚Äôt it?

Mizrahi Jews are known to face quite a lot of discrimination albeit not as much as today. However, even though they are a good portion of the population (40-45), there has been no prime minister, very few of them in high position of power, are disproportionately put in jail and are the ones sent to illegally settle the West Bank. Almost as if Israel doesn‚Äôt care about Jews and hates brown/black peoples. Pretty white supremacist in my opinion.

Lastly, the West Bank. Now here you can‚Äôt use the excuse of Hamas since the PA is pathetic and can‚Äôt exercise their power. In this state, Apartheid rules (as said by an Israeli commander). In this state, Palestinians need several passports to even go to work, they have curfews, are not allowed to go to certain places or do anything simply because of their ethnicity. Human Righrs Watch found that the situation can have the definition of Apartheid applied to it, especially with how they forcibly transfer Palestinians out of their home. Overall, creating a two tiered civil rights system that oppresses Palestinians and treats them as second class citizEns even though they are under occupation and Israeli rule. Sound familiar? It should seeing how a famous regime did the same thing.

Now you‚Äôre wondering , which regime could have done such bad things. Well, one was South Africa which was the country that coined Apartheid and we know how bad that was. But the other regime whom we can compare this situation are the Nazis. I mean come on, forced relocation, two tiered civil rights system, constant harassment, forced relocation, constant demonization. By all means this should sound off the fucking alarms form 3000 miles away.

There is absolutely nothing inappropriate about it.

Antisemitism: Racism against Jewish people and people. It can be separated into two categories. Racial antisemitism and religious antisemitism. The term originates in Germany where racist german anthropologists argued based on linguistic patterns that Jews were a part of the ‚Äúinferior race‚Äù of Semites, while Germans and other Europeans belonged to the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù Aryan race. But the term itself is a misnomer since the term doesn‚Äôt apply to prejudice against other ‚ÄúSemites‚Äù like Arabs, Aramaic, and Ethiopians. But still applies to racism against Jews who don‚Äôt speak Hebrew or any other Semitic language.


Zionism: Is a nationalists movement that believes that the only way for Jews in Europe and elsewhere in the world to be safe is for them to have a national homeland. The movement started in Central and Eastern Europe. While earlier Zionists thinkers like Theodore Hertzle and others believed East Africa (Uganda, or Madagascar) would be the ideal place. Others felt that those areas don‚Äôt have an historical or religious significant to Jewish diaspora and thus argued that Palestine (which was an Ottoman province) would be the ideal place for its historic and religious significant to the diaspora. Before it was a Jewish nationalists movement there was religious Christian zionists millennialist  movement that believed that return of Jews to the Holy Lands (and conversion to Christianity) was essential for the second coming of Jesus Christ. Some in the 1600s even argued that the [British people are the TRUE Israelites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Israelism?wprov=sfti1#) and they were the lost tribe of Israel.  The Catholic and Orthodox doctrines believe that human actions cannot accelerate or impede the second coming. But with the rise of Proteanism and Lutherism came a rejection of that doctrine and [Martin Luther himself advocated for the return of European Jews to Palestine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Zionism?wprov=sfti1#Catholic_Church)  


In short there are two types of Zionism. 
Jewish Zionism which came as a need to escape rampant antisemitism in Europe and elsewhere in the world.  That Zionism was largely secular. 

And Christian Zionism which is a religious millennialist moment that believes that the return of Jews to the holy land is essential for the second coming.

1csg7xh,l47y08q,ChikenBBQ,"Generally speaking if you have opposing groups doing demonstrations in the same place at the same time, you do not have any demonstrations but rather more a brawl. Generally the way this is managed in such a way that peoples right to assemble is observed, one demonstration is allowed to go on at a time and they may or may not have to go through a process to be able to do it. If a counter demonstration does happen, its sort of the police job to make sure that the demonstration and the counter demonstration are physically seperated by like a lot of distance, like 100' to 100s of yd. The reason for this is if anyone breaks from their semi designated area to go over and pick a fight with the other, its really clear who is i stigating what and the cops can act.

What youre seeing here is none of that and as a result its getting violent. Trying to be as far to the cops as my admittedly ACAB ass can be, the cops really are not at all trying to facilitate peace here at all. I would make the claim that the cops want a fight to break out because they actually want to ""break up the fight"" with a heavier hand of biolence on one side than the other. Having been to many protests before, the counter protestors should be like on the other side of a street or like the other side of a park so the distance establishes like clear premeditated intent to instigate violent conflict. These 2 groups being allowed to be this close to each other is beyond negligent, this seems intentional.",-7,1715809844.0,t1_l47ogad

1cmobeo,l338cc2,[deleted],"People will disagree with what I'm saying below, but I would like to exercise the right to my own opinion and add to the ongoing discourse of events that transpired. Please don't resort to childish insults, name-calling, or hostility. Please be respectful adults.

Imagine UCSD hadn't done anything, and the encampment was left up. Based on what happened at UCLA and other institutions, it couldn't be surprising to see violence break out at some point. I know myself and fellow Tritons were and are non-violent and peaceful people. However, we've seen from the arrests that took place 20 people were not students. They could just as well be harmless, but we don't know for sure. In fact, on Saturday, when the counter-protesters showed up, there was a guy saying antisemitic things and trying to provoke and agitate the counter-protests.

Now imagine that something, God forbid, did occur, and police were not able to intervene in time, and people got seriously hurt. Blame would get placed on UCSD administration for not dismantling the encampment when other universities such as UCLA didn't do anything at first, and then were forced to when violence broke out and people got hurt. The police reported finding a sword in the encampment when they took it down. As you can see, the encampment may not have immediately posed a threat but had the potential to get out of control really quickly, like what happened at UCLA. I don't say I agree or disagree with the choices the administration took, but people need to understand both sides of the equation and not just scream bloody murder at the administration and police when things didn't turn out how they wanted them to. Please remember that when we break rules, there are consequences even if we are morally correct. People were surprised that a FEW students got hit and not seriously injured. From what I saw in a livestream of the entire event, a protester was trying to steal a police baton from a police officer. If you consider the point of view of the police officer, you need to think about what you would do if someone is trying to steal your weapon from you. Do you just let them take it? Can you trust that they won't use your own weapon against you? What are the intentions of this stranger who approached me? If I remain non-violent, will they just stop? Is it worth risking my life to not engage in force to stop them? You can decide for yourself whether you thought the officers actions were justified or not.

Regarding the other students who may have been hit: If you were doing nothing wrong, I am very sorry you were caught in the crossfire.

Now for everyone else: If you watch the videos online, you can clearly see police don't go on a violence spree of violence attacking any and all protesters near them. They don't violently hit and repeatedly hit someone. It seems to me that as soon as people saw the police using force and violence, people have been spreading not entirely accurate picture of what happened but something much more violent, inhumane, and sinister. If you read other comments in this post, you can see people saying the administration was trying to beat up students or get them killed. Take a step back and think what you are saying. 

They only resorted to the use of force when protesters became a safety risk to themselves. Imagine you were walking on a street at night and someone started walking towards you with a mask hiding their face. Would you feel threatened? Now imagine there are 200 people, and you also know about something called mob mentality. Being part of a group can lead to heightened emotions, be that excitement, anger, hostility, etc. Deindividuation and diffusion of responsibility also occur. Things can go from peaceful to life-threatening in an instant.
When you don't give police adequate space, or back them in a corner you give them justification to use force.

I'm saying all of this because I don't want anyone to get hurt both students and law enforcement. Respect each other, we are all human.",20,1715144057.0,t3_1cmobeo

I also have yet to see any image or clarification about this sword, and from all my time interacting with people and being there, I saw no indication of tools for or intention for violence.

Out of curiosity, how is it discrimination?

When it comes to discrimination, in the context of employment laws. That applies to a protected class, religion, race, gay, age, etc.

Choosing  to not hire a candidate from certain universities, or if that person participated in or even arrested, or posted on social media. Is not a protected class.

An employer is well within their rights to not hire candidates with a criminal record. Or choose yo not hire from universities with a bad reputation. 

It might be worth considering that one decision made in a split second could ruin all the years of work it took to get here. It could ruin your future.

Also, employers are paying attention and taking note of which universities are the biggest places of damage. 

Just imagine that you are graduating with honors. But you find that no one will hire you, because of where you went to school.

And you did nothing wrong, did not participate just focused on graduating.

One of the things that I have the most problem with is the performative nature of this protest.  If students really cared about this they would....

  
A)  Go protest (like deny entrance to the building) for CALPERS and CALSTRS - which have by Far much more $$ in Isreali companies as the worlds largest pension funds.

B)  Not hide their faces.   Not be controlled in speaking to the press.  The american civil rights movements of the past that were effective were PROUD to be identified.

C)  Have a more nuansced and thought out position than what is being chanted.  The current situation is a MESS but that means that it is complicated.  

D)  And also be realistic that the called for actions are unlikely (completely) to be effective in changing Isreali policies.  Many of the current government's supporters are largely withdrawn from the (modern) economy - disinvestment likely hurts more moderate/secular isrealis rather than the supporters of the current govenment.",7,1715127710.0,t1_l3262hc

As we finalize the process, you may notice that pending financial aid awards are not currently visible in TritonPay. Rest assured that your financial aid remains available and your account will be updated once your financial aid is released.¬†

The registration fee payment deadline has been postponed to **Wednesday, September 25**¬†to allow additional processing time. Students with pending aid disbursements should wait on paying your balance, if any, until financial aid is applied to your account.

We're working closely with Student Financial Solutions, the Registrar's Office and ITS to ensure a smooth disbursement process. Please monitor TritonPay over the next day for updates and thank you for your patience.",85,1726593215.0,t3_1fj3ij9

This strike is a pretty terrible idea. There's already a rather large schism between the STEM and non-STEM members in the union. At least when I was in, there was already some degree of resentment from the STEM members towards the non-STEM members for their direction-finding and priorities in negotiations, although I'm not sure if that sentiment has shifted since then.

Considering the majority of the Israel-UC collaborations are STEM projects, care must be taken as to avoid even the appearance of simply sacrificing those with less voice in the union.

Officially, Palestine is *not* the Union's motive for the strike. The strike is a protest against UC violating its employees‚Äô rights to free speech by *banning pro-Palestine protestors from from campus, under threat of arrest* [meaning theyre fired from their UC jobs, evicted from campus housing, and academically suspended]. Regardless of what they were protesting *for*, UC firing a group of its workers for participating in a political demonstration is, in the perspective of the Union, an Unfair Labor Practice.

The Union's official stance on Palestine, fwiw, is that it encourages UC to at least meet with the protesting groups and listen to their demands in good faith. The Union can't legally strike *for* Palestine. 

I think it's cool that some of the striking students give their efforts a pro-Palestinian emphasis.

the UC regents have been making UCSD admit more and more students; UCSD can't do much about that. since we already had a housing crisis, the chancellor's choice here is whether and how to tackle that housing crisis, which he is by building all of these living and learning neighborhoods in the past decade

founding two new colleges and building more housing isn't done to admit more students; rather, more students are being admitted so more colleges and housing are needed

the chancellor is pretty icky but housing is something the school making somewhat alright progress on, compared to other universities

1ci4xo2,l2ht2pu,[deleted],"More enlightened centrist bullshit. Let me break it down for you cause you went out of your way to explain your position which I do appreciate.

Fuck hamas. I completely agree. 100% they gotta go. But let snot forget that they have been in power since 2007. So in the time since they were in power they never once thing anything like what they did on 10/7. They sent missiles here and there and sometimes they killed soldiers or civilians or didn't even hit anything. On 10/7 the Israeli military was not guarding the border of Israel and Gaza. They were off protecting illegal settlers in the west bank. So hamas, as disgusting as they are, did what I think most would agree was a very good move (from their perspective), they took advantage. Again I'm not defending what they did, but if we can be honest with ourselves, if their goal is to destroy Israel, which it is, it makes sense they would take advantage of the fact That the military wasn't near by. Would you agree? So honestly it's simple, just bring back the military to where they were and hamas would jo longer be able to attack in any substantial way, just like the last 17 YEARS!

Second, 9/11 was fucked. No doubt, but who did it? Iraq? No. Iran? No. Who? Oh that's right a couple of Saudis, Egyptians and Pakistanis. So why did the us invade Afghanistan and Iraq? We completely destroyed their economies and killed over a million people based on what? Wmds? The ones that Iraq supposedly had? Oh wait the US government knew they didn't because the dismantled them. In the 90's under UN supervision. So what is the point of bringing up 9/11,its terrible example. Palestine is an illegally occupied territory, no one has any doubt about this. Unless you're an enlightened centrist. According to international law, the occupied have the right to self defense. If the attack on 10/7 justifies Israels massacre of Palestine, then the illegal brutal occupation for 80+ years justifies hamas. Imo it doesn't, but its people like you who have yet to explain why that is. I think it doesn't because killing civilians is bad period, but those who try to explain Israels actions and justified by hamas attack, can't explain why that same line of reasoning doesn't justify hamas attack?

Dude I honestly don't have sympathy for your enlightened centrist bullshit. Do you really think, protesting the killing of 30k people, the leveling of an entire city, displacing 2 million people, apartheid, illegal occupation and illegal settlements means the protestors support hamas? Youre really falling for the zionists propaganda. Calling out Israel is not antisemitic, that just a garbage ass take. One that Israel has been trying to make our country swallow for a long time. It doesn't make any sense. I guess that means calling out Iran or Saudi Arabia for anything they do is Islamophobic. It's exactly the same thing. How not.

There it is, the problem is that the protestors are doing the protests correctly. Their demands are childish. Idk man have you ever been to a protest? About anything? Maybe you have maybe not, I'm guessing not since more enlightened centrist have no back bone for anything. Cmon on man, people are being killed, thousands of people are being killed with our tax dollars and you're trying to find any excuse to not try to stop it. All those student protests of the last 60 years were just a waste of time I guess.

I don't personally know any Israel supporters who think any more than roughly 25,000 Gazans are Hamas, and I'm including my Israeli-American Jewish friends. I think there are many Gazans who support Hamas, but that doesn't mean they deserve to die. I honestly consider myself fairly agnostic on this issue. It's horrible what's happening in Gaza, but it's war. What happened in October was horrific, and America would respond even more harshly if we were attacked that way. With that said, I think Israel has been disregarding far too many civilian casualties for the last many months, and the US should certainly stop providing them money/weapons for that. 

In my experience on social media, I've had Palestine supporters tell me that it doesn't matter if genoicde ends up being committed against Israel because they deserve it since they get money from America. Then they follow that up saying they aren't racist or anti-semites.

1ciwz9n,l2fm7f7,The_CIA_is_watching,"&gt;I really feel like social media algorithms are fucking up the dialogue around this whole issue

No shit, that's what social media does. It makes exchange of information very very easy because it removes the need for an exchange of *UNDERSTANDING*, whether understanding the other side or understanding the conflict.

&gt;  
I've had Palestine supporters tell me that it doesn't matter if genoicde ends up being committed against Israel because they deserve it since they get money from America. Then they follow that up saying they aren't racist or anti-semites.

I remember seeing a post on r/Palestine that said, ""Jewish people in America are being discriminated against in dating apps because they're Jewish"", and the comments were unironically saying things along the lines of: ""Good, those filthy Zionists don't deserve love!"" Total casual racism, and then people wonder why they look antisemitic.",2,1714760420.0,t1_l2e8vvx
1ciwz9n,l2flw4x,The_CIA_is_watching,"This is a strawman of the pro-Israel side. I could maybe see people like that in Twitter/X comment threads, where you can also find people saying Stalin should have killed more Ukrainians or that Jews control the world. But if you go somewhere like r/Israel or even r/NonCredibleDefense, you will NOT see anybody saying this. (It's just like nobody except the most extremist pro-Palestinians, and of course Hamas, say that ""all Jews are Zionists and don't deserve to live"")

This seems like you misinterpreted people saying ""many Gazans have Hamas sympathies"" as ""ALL GAZANS ARE HAMAS!!!!!11!"". Only one redditor that I saw in the entirety of yesterday actually tried to say that, and both sides downvoted him into oblivion for spreading misinformation.

Think of it this way: around half of Americans support sending aid to Ukraine. Does this mean that half of America are Ukrainian soldiers who will die on the battlefield to fight Russia? No, not at all. These Gazans may be partial towards Hamas, but they are not fighters. Does this mean they are allowed to cheer when Hamas parades dead bodies through the streets? No, but they aren't fighters so they shouldn't have to die.

But while having Hamas sympathies doesn't mean they need to die, the reality is that **40% of Hamas being wiped out** in exchange for 4% of Gaza's civilian population is a VERY VERY good trade. We may never have such a high exchange rate ever again if this conflict continues and the situation gets worse, so as tragic as these deaths are, Israel really has no choice.",2,1714760310.0,t1_l2d6st6

In early 2022 for example he said that Russia would never invade ukraine and anyone claiming so was spreading propaganda. So at best here he's really, really fucking stupid and at worst he's just genuinely evil. Of course after he did his usual ""apology"" video, because if you're wrong half the time instead of actually making more informed takes just apologize every time you get called out and keep repeating the same behavior.

On top of that he has a lot of experience with political news media as well, is surprisingly knowledgeable about history and religion, and many members of his chat are highly educated and contribute excellent information as well. Of course the majority are teenagers and young adults, because that is twitch, but that doesn't minimize the great reference material that is often shared in chat. He often watches interviews with philosophers and professors like Noam Chomsky, highlighting their points to help them get across to the less educated in chat, regardless of how much it bores people. In the end it proves to his fans that he cares about educating them more than just entertaining them, I think it contributes to the consistency of his fan base.

It is also just delicious when he roasts haters in chat, randomly people come parroting talking points about Hasan or his leftist positions, or his positions on major issues like the genocide in Gaza. When they just want to argue in chat but can't prove their points he roasts them. But if they are willing, he has actually interviewed these people live and taken his time to respectfully dismantle their talking points and guide them towards a more factual understanding of the situation. From indoctrinated Jewish teenagers to Asmongold, he has been having *conversations* instead of debates that are insanely educational because of how the talking points people have been fed demand so much evidence to overcome.

You cherry picked one time where he was wrong about a prediction, but when it comes to factual information he doesn't deceive his audience and his candid about his sources.

He is an excellent person to watch when you need help dismantling the really fucked up talking points that people use to defend imperialism and exploitative capitalism.

1clr4q6,l2xibqu,[deleted],"Actually you‚Äôre right and I agree with you. I like trolling on the internet for fun when I‚Äôm on the toilet.  The establishment is there to benefit nobody but themselves. They push woke shit to benefit themselves until it doesn‚Äôt, then they call in the stormtroopers. 

I think police officers for the most part are good people caught up in the same mind virus everyone else is in. They go into work and beat up kids because they‚Äôve been lead to believe that you guys are the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù. Meanwhile the real enemy is everyone in the establishment. Doesn‚Äôt matter what political party, they‚Äôre all in one big club and we‚Äôre not in it. The more civil unrest there is the more power they can acquire. I know half the country was against those people who stormed the capital, but after the last few months I think we should March to the capital left/right United as one and grab every politician we can get our hands on and hang them in the street. United we stand, divided we fall - and they know that. 

I‚Äôm not against what the protest stands for, the war in Gaza needs to stop and our tax dollars and fueling the fire while our inner cities are collapsing. But that being said propping up a terrorist group and antisemitism isn‚Äôt the right answer either. Protesting exclusively for peace is what I think should be going on.",0,1715052131.0,t1_l2x7l8m

I am posting mostly because I think this is an important learning opportunity regarding Hanlon's razor, and partly because I don't want this to contribute to anxiety regarding the physics 1-series.

However, it was not my intent for students to receive 0s when there were only a handful of good faith mistakes across the entire class, as on this most recent quiz.

Also, yes, naming a Black character 'Kingsley Shacklebolt' is racist, because you're reducing Blackness to slavery. Naming an Asian character 'Cho Chang' is racist because you're showing a blatant disrespect for Asian culture and treating Asian cultures as interchangeable. Get over yourself.

UC San Diego? Oh, you mean UC Socially Dead‚Äîthe land of endless Triton Trotters and ‚ÄúLa Jolla Promise,‚Äù where dreams go to sunbathe and suffocate in foggy mediocrity. Let‚Äôs dive into this prestigious purgatory:
	
1.	The Campus Layout: Whoever designed UCSD‚Äôs campus clearly hated students. Why else would they arrange the buildings like a Monopoly board that was shaken mid-game? It‚Äôs like a Hunger Games arena, where your greatest enemy is Google Maps.
	
2.	The Colleges: You have six (sorry, seven now, ‚ÄúSeventh College‚Äù like an awkward afterthought) colleges that exist solely to confuse freshmen and complicate housing. What‚Äôs the difference? None, except ERC kids pretending their MMW class is harder than Revelle‚Äôs HUM, while Sixth College exists as a TikTok meme generator.
	
3.	Geisel Library: Ah yes, the brutalist Death Star of Knowledge, a monument to crushing academic despair. Looks like someone hit ‚Äúrandomize‚Äù in a 1980s sci-fi LEGO set. Inside? Quiet floors filled with procrastinating engineers and people asleep on their textbooks.
	
4.	Social Life: Or should I say, lack thereof. UCSD‚Äôs ‚Äúsocial scene‚Äù is like its mascot: non-existent. Parties feel like someone read a WikiHow on ‚ÄúFun‚Äù and failed spectacularly. The introverts are introverting, and the extroverts are stuck at SDSU.
	
5.	The Mascot: A Triton‚Äîbasically a B-grade Poseidon knockoff no one asked for. Meanwhile, other schools have bears, tigers, and literal Bruins. Your mascot is a dude holding a fork.
	
6.	Parking: Congratulations! You paid hundreds for a parking pass, only to circle Pangea like it‚Äôs Mario Kart: UCSD Edition. And don‚Äôt even think about parking at Gliderport unless you want a side gig as a mountaineer.
	
7.	Weather Flex: Yes, it‚Äôs sunny, but you can‚Äôt even enjoy it because you‚Äôre stuck in class learning about MATLAB or analyzing Moby-Dick. When you finally emerge, it‚Äôs foggy, and you‚Äôre in La Jolla where everything costs your firstborn child.
	
8.	Triton Cash: Imagine being scammed into believing that your prepaid campus Monopoly money is useful anywhere beyond overpriced burritos. Pro tip: It‚Äôs not.
	
9.	Your Rivals: Oh wait, you don‚Äôt have any. Because UCSD is too busy competing with itself‚ÄîSTEM majors vs. humanities majors, Revelle kids vs. everyone else, and engineers vs. basic social skills.
	
10.	Graduation? On a field so far from campus you might as well call it ‚ÄúUC Baja.‚Äù By the time you find your seat, you‚Äôve already aged five years.

But hey, at least the ocean‚Äôs nearby. You know, for when the academic burnout hits, and you need a place to scream into the void.",7,1733851605.0,t3_1has5mu

Arabs are able to be doctors and lawyers, Arab women are allowed freedom, and because LGBTQ people are not pushed from rooftops in Israel, many gay Palestinians flee to seek amnesty in Israel.

(By the way, 2/3 of Israeli Jews are Middle Eastern Jews, displaced from their homes by Muslim ethnical cleansing.

It's funny you don't mention the West Bank or Gaza at all, which Israel is the de facto occupying power over. For example, Palestinians have their freedom of travel heavily restricted via checkpoints. There's even roads that are restricted to West Bank settlers, that Palestinians can't use! This is just the tip of the iceberg, since there's too much to talk about, ranging from the constant expropriation of private Palestinian land by the State of Israel to the constant harassment of Palestinians by the IDF ([see for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Eyad_al-Hallaq) the time an Israeli cop shot an unarmed autistic Palestinian man and was subsequently acquitted by an Israeli court of all crimes, or the time [the IDF shot an unarmed Palestinian Jewish convert with his hands on his head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_David_Ben_Avraham))

Why do you think so many of the Israeli Jews being pursued by the Israeli police yell ""don't shoot, I'm Jewish""? Must be because of the awesome equality going on between Jewish ppl and Arabs going on in that country, right?

If you want to learn more and see a stronger argument for Israel being an apartheid state, you can look at the extensive report written by [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution) here. But for some reason I feel as though you are not arguing in good faith and will continue to parrot the ""Israel is totally treating Palestinians equally, look we even have a few Arabs in the army"" talking point.",17,1714715141.0,t1_l2crrgs
1cixfxt,l2dec4k,latteboy50,None of your arguments suggest Israel is an ‚Äúapartheid state‚Äù. There are more Arabs living peacefully in Israel than there are Jews in the entire rest of the Middle Eastern countries combined. That is a relatively new phenomenon.,-2,1714726696.0,t1_l2cy5te
1cixfxt,l2dfbth,iamunknowntoo,"&gt;There are more Arabs living peacefully in Israel than there are Jews in the entire rest of the Middle Eastern countries combined.

Besides the assertion that Arabs have nothing to complain about in Israel, it seems like you are conveniently glossing over the 4.5 million Palestinians living in Gaza and the West Bank, over which Israel is the de facto occupying power. You know, the main reason why people say Israel is committing apartheid.

&gt;None of your arguments suggest Israel is an ‚Äúapartheid state‚Äù.

I provided multiple examples, such as the segregated roads and the restriction of travel for Palestinians specifically (an element of apartheid). I even linked in the previous comment a comprehensive report from Human Rights Watch arguing that Israel is committing apartheid, using the definition provided in the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.

1cixfxt,l2f00zv,iamunknowntoo,"&gt; West Bank and Gaza are not part of Israel therefore the Arabs that live there are not Israeli citizens.

What part of ""Israel is an occupying power over West Bank and Gaza"", do you not understand? Why do you think the official name for the West Bank and Gaza is the ""Occupied Palestinian Terrorities""?

Even if they are not legally citizens of Israel, they are in practice under Israel's rule (in West Bank it is an explicit military occupation, in Gaza it is a blockade that cuts them off from the rest of the world). That is what people are calling apartheid rule.

&gt; Gaza is not occupied by Israel.  They left in 2005.

The blockade Israel imposes on Gaza makes them an occupying power. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN agree on this.

As [Amnesty's](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/007/2009/en/) report puts it:

&gt; Israel is the occupying power in the Gaza Strip. In 2005, as part of what it termed ‚Äúdisengagement‚Äù from Gaza, Israel removed its settlements and settlers. Yet despite the redeployment of its troops in 2005, the Israeli army has retained effective control over the Gaza Strip. Israel maintains sole control of Gaza‚Äôs airspace and territorial waters and does not allow any movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza via air or sea. Israel also 
continues to exercise a degree of control over Gaza‚Äôs border with Egypt and Israeli officials have repeatedly made it clear that this border can only be reopened within the framework of a joint agreement with the Palestinian Authority and Egypt.Israel also continues to control electricity, water and 
telecommunications in Gaza. It has regularly conducted raids in Gaza, often arresting ‚Äúwanted‚Äù men; and carrying out so-called ‚Äútargeted killings‚Äù, in air instrikes which have claimed a high toll on civilians.",5,1714752783.0,t1_l2e4pmj

In public universities large and well-traveled paths can become a public forum space, however discretion is still given to the university to restrict access to it or remove/arrest outsiders for trespassing (https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/access-public-property#). For students, as stated in the email, encampment is restricted under the campus policy (https://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/PPM/docs/516-10.3.html) which (I believe) is agreed upon by the students when they enroll into UCSD.

Now to answer your comment:

1. My most recent experience was when a Jewish classmate referred to me and my friends as violent arabush multiple times, despite letting them know we find that racist. An Imam also got maced by the police, and they said that is what a terrorist deserves. We recognized this person was Jewish because they were wearing a necklace with a star of david. We could have reported it, but Muslims are already being braded as antisemetic for whatever they do against a Jew, so we decided not to. But my point is that the hatred is well and alive. To think otherwise is foolish.
2. I don't support any Middle Eastern governments, but that doesn't mean that Jews aren't welcome by regular Muslim people. There is antisemism in the Muslim community the same way as there is anti-arabism and islamaphobia in the Jewish community. Also just as an example for the fact Jews are protected, there are Jewish communities in Iran (largest Jewish diaspora outside Israel in the middle east), although the Iranian government is very hostile towards Israel, it does somewhat ""protect"" its Jews similar to how Israel ""protects"" Palestinians. Neither are good, and I don't support either government, hence I stand against both. Discrimination is discrimination, regardless of what the race/religion of the victim is. This was an interesting video I found regarding this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHV1QUs-BA4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHV1QUs-BA4)
3. In the western world, Islam is not absolutely immune from criticism. Just because you are in a liberal bubble at UCSD doesn't mean its an accurate representation of the western world. Look up experiences of Muslims post 9/11. Surveilance of muslim communities by the US government (https://time.com/6097712/muslim-american-surveillance-supreme-court-sept-11/) fully was in action by the Bush administration. Jews have not experienced government surveilance to such extent (and I hope they don't because its wrong), although its not a competition to see who has it harder. All I'm trying to point out is that there is no double standard here.",0,1715824045.0,t1_l48h0s5
1cs8yku,l47jnib,iamunknowntoo,"&gt;Israel is the only liberal democracy in the Middle East

""Liberal democracy""? Israel is currently the occupying power over a people, who are deprived of their rights and property under Israeli occupation. [This is an indisputable fact recognized by numerous credible human rights organizations.](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution).

Hell, don't take it from me, take it from a [former Mossad chief](https://apnews.com/article/israel-apartheid-palestinians-occupation-c8137c9e7f33c2cba7b0b5ac7fa8d115).

I guess by your standard Apartheid South Africa was also a ""liberal democracy"", just for some people lol. Some people are more equal than others amirite?

Israel is also being credibly accused with genocide in the ICJ, and the ICC is about to hit a bunch of top Israel officials with some arrest warrants for war crimes (which is evident by the fact that [those very officials are scrambling to prevent the ICC from issuing those warrants](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-04-28/ty-article/.premium/israel-scrambles-as-netanyahu-defense-chiefs-face-possible-icc-arrest-warrants/0000018f-2537-d0a5-abcf-37ff394f0000) ). If there's no credible allegations then why are top officials so scared of getting arrested by the ICC (the same ICC, by the way, that is pursuing an arrest warrant against Putin and successfully prosecuted war criminals like Ratko Mladic in the past)?

&gt;and is one of the most tolerant countries in the world.

A tolerant country where [settlers can commit pogroms against Palestinians with the military completely letting them do so?](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/middleeast/huwara-west-bank-settler-attack-cmd-intl/index.html) Well, I guess they are tolerant in the sense that they tolerate fanatic pogromists, lol.

A tolerant country where ['48 Palestinians get doxxed and suspended for celebrating engagements?](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-hamas-war-free-speech-crackdown-palestinians-students-rcna120985)?

A tolerant country where [teachers face suspension hearings](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-12-29/ty-article/.premium/tel-aviv-high-school-principal-faces-suspension-for-sympathizing-with-suffering-of-gazans/0000018c-b09c-db94-afbd-b0fd76a80000) and even [violently attacked](https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/tel-aviv-school-principal-attacked-students-supporting-gaza-children) for expressing sympathy for Gazan civilians suffering as a result of the war?

If you are sincere, and not just trying to lie about it, tell us what is wrong in the article and studies cited in it.    

If this is true:  ""30,000 Gazans have died, mostly women and children"", then why are you saying 60% (so many children and women) are combatants?   

And why would you be ok with even 5000 children killed?    And tens of thousands of children being badly injured/maimed.

You counter protest wherever protesters are

1cs8yku,l43wver,[deleted],"I didn't see Palestine protesters today, unless they were somewhere else or at a different time then when I passed by. Also I do think it's a bit weird. The point of protesting is to show dissatisfaction with what the government or some organization is doing. So you protest to let them know and to encourage them to change their action/behaviors to more align with what you believe is right.

So these protests are a little weird bc the government is already doing what these people want them to do. The US is already supporting Israel so it's weird to protest, bc they have nothing to protest against.

&gt;Perhaps you would be better off in a trade rather than wasting your parents money at college given your sub par intellectual aptitude.....

I'm not sure if you're familiar with the admission process for this school, but they actually do consider each applicant before letting them in (looking at their transcript, personal statements, accomplishments etc.). As it turns out, getting into this school is really not easy, the middle 50 percentile GPA for this school is like 4.11-4.3

So it probably isn't accurate to say that OP is wasting their time/money by going to this school bc the fact that they got in is already a really good sign that they are smart enough to go here (keep in mind that the graduation rate for this school is almost 90%, so the school really isn't letting in people who don't deserve to be here or aren't smart enough to be here).",5,1715745024.0,t1_l43ntv4

I had a similar thing happen to me when I was accepted in 2018, i tried calling, emailing, but the only thing that worked was showing up at the admissions office in person. I had to plead my case a few times &amp; be persistent; but the most important thing you can do is come with a physical or digital documents to assist the staff that is helping you. If you can bring official docs that support your correction, thats perfect. If not, still show up, just be sure to do so early &amp; plan on staying a few hours so you can contact your own school, &amp; have them email you transcripts. You can even print them out on campus at Geisel library. 

TLDR: 
1. show up in person as soon as feasibly possible
2. Try your best to come prepared with any relevant docs you have immediate access to
3. With or without docs: Come early in their working hours, prepare to stay for at least a few hours. Communicating with your school, then subsequently getting that info to admissions may take time &amp; effort but don‚Äôt leave until you have hard assurances that your problem is resolved.

I can‚Äôt stress it enough but you‚Äôve already done all the hard work getting accepted, now it‚Äôs just time to follow through!! You got thisüëç",13,1724814304.0,t1_lk9zu2j

1f2ydq8,lke87az,kittygator1,"I know the answer! 

Universities, like UCSD, must ensure their admissions processes are accurate. During audits, which are standard practice, universities need to verify students' claimed achievements. This includes requiring students to provide evidence, such as AP scores. If a university is found to have admitted, enrolled, or graduated students based on false information, it could jeopardize their accreditation and reputation.

Requesting AP scores and transcripts serves two purposes: 1) it verifies the accuracy of the information on your application, ensuring that you were admitted based on accurate data, and 2) it allows the university to demonstrate that they followed proper procedures and admitted students in good faith.

If you enjoy policy, law, and drama, higher education jobs might be a good fit. I've worked in higher education for years and recently transitioned to independent counseling because I prefer to read about drama rather than be in it. The field of Admissions and Enrollment Management should be an entire academic department because it incorporates concepts from sociology, psychology, business, communication, data science, politics, public administration, and more.

I went to community college, despite the (unfounded) prejudices I had against it. I loved it! My counselor‚Äôs, professors, faculty, and classmates were amazing. I was able to get 2 AA‚Äôs and an AA for transfer with no debt &amp; while working to save for the next big thing.

additionally your case is trying to get out of paying your boyfriend's fare. now it might not be on purpose and you were just trying to keep the passenger flow going, but it's still trying to get out of paying.

Bullshit. Pure bullshit. It's a call for murder of Jews that uses an onion-skin thin veneer of ""plausible deniability"" that unfortunately is all that's necessary to give morons in the West the self-assurance that their Jew hatred is justified.

&gt;Also, I'm pretty sure it was just the second intifada that had a suicide bombings and stuff from Hamas right? Wasn't the first one a lot less violent?

No. The first one was still violent. The second one was particularly bad. The myth that the 1st Intifada was some kind of ""peaceful protest"" is just that - a myth.

&gt;Also I think scale is also important, from what I understand, the number of Palestinians killed in cold blood still vastly outnumber the number of Israelis killed in cold blood.

Wrong. Israel aims their bombs at terrorists and unfortunately civilians die in the process. Hamas aims their rockets indiscriminately at population centers with the express purpose of killing as many ~~Jews~~ Israelis as possible. Israel didn't send a bunch of fighters into Gaza along with ""civilians"" tagging along to rape, behead, burn alive, kidnap, torture, and shoot as many Palestinians as possible; Hamas did.

Fixed that for you

&gt; Also this has nothing to do with Jew hatred, but it's instead about hating the thing that a state is doing

It most certainly is about Jew hatred when every single one of these protests has people chanting, ""From the river to the sea"", which is a call for the elimination of the state of Israel, the only Jewish state in the world that's been around for 76 years (and just 2 years shy of Jordan, its neighbor, formed in 1946). That's when they're chanting in English; the original Arabic chant that shows up less frequently at these protests translates to ""From the water to the water, Palestine is Arabic"". 

&gt; Also I'm pretty sure the first intifada started off peaceful, but bc of actions from Israel it shifted

Ah ok. ""The Jews made me be a terrorist!"". 

&gt; I just looked it up and looks like only 1.5k Israelis died whereas 36k Palestinians died.

You would think that given their abysmal failure at both trying to eliminate Israel, as well as fighting the wars to eliminate Israel, the Palestinians would agree to a peace agreement and establishment of a recognized state, but it hasn't happened since first being proposed in 1939. If they wanted peace, they would have gotten it back then and Israel would be smaller today than whatever they would have chosen to name their nascent Arabic state (""Palestinian"" only came to be as a self identification in the 1960s; you probably didn't know this. Before then the non-Jewish ""Palestinians"" self identified as ""Arabs"").",3,1715883845.0,t1_l4ca118
1ct3zq3,l4cf5g4,[deleted],"&gt;Fixed that for you

Nah lol. You broke it. Let me try to correct each thing one by one.

&gt;**after waging a 20 year terror campaign after gaining power**¬†is killing a bunch of civilians¬†**as unfortunately happens in urban combat**

From what I understand, this conflict didn't come out of nowhere. I'm pretty sure this is a result of the apartheid like conditions that the israeli government instituted as well as the constant encroachment on palestinian land. Yes civilian death tends to happen in urban combat in general, but I'm pretty sure the general idea about the protests is that this war shouldn't even be happening at all since immoral actions on Israel's side led to the conditions that caused the war to happen.

&gt;**call for an uprising using the same term that was used during the last genocidal attempt against Jews**, because the world¬†**hates it when Jews exercise self defense and counter-terrorism despite most of the people having a problem with it coming from actual settler-colonial states that have engaged in nonstop military operations for decades**

So the thing is that it's wrong when other people do this thing as well. The US's occupation of Afghanistan was also wrong. Russia charging into Ukraine was also wrong. The US entering Vietnam was also wrong. Most of these things also had plenty of protests against it's not an israel specific protest since there were also protests for a lot of these things as well.

&gt;Ah ok. ""The Jews made me be a terrorist!"".

Yeah, kind of (although I'd change it to not be ""the jews"" who did it, but instead the Israeli government). The things that Hamas is doing is wrong. I'll admit that. But you might just be ignorant to the conditions that lead to these groups forming in the first place. When you have an occupation like this against a group of people who don't really have a formal military in the same way you do, and when your military is getting a shit ton of funding and is being propped up by the world's biggest bully (America) then the other side is gonna have to make due with what they can. This means the really nasty guerilla warfare that you often see in terrorist groups. Also when you start an attack like this, it does lead to a lot of people who you're fighting against to start having antisemtic view (which are absolutely wrong, but this is just how the world works).

&gt;It most certainly is about Jew hatred when every single one of these protests has people chanting, ""From the river to the sea"", which is a call for the elimination of the state of Israel...

Again there is a distinction between the state of Israel and actual Jewish people. Also, most of the protest on this campus that I've been to usually involve chants about the number of people dead and things like that, I think that's been the main focus of this protest.

&gt;You would think that given their abysmal failure at both trying to eliminate Israel, as well as fighting the wars to eliminate Israel, the Palestinians would agree...

Red Herring. We were talking about the scale of innocent death on both sides. Who should/shouldn't agree to a peace treaty is a different conversation than who is killing more innocent people.",3,1715884959.0,t1_l4cbxn1

This is 100% false. I'm interacting with you in good faith here and hoping you're not just jerking my chain to waste both of our time - this has always been about Arabs never accepting the idea of a Jewish state coming out of the power vacuum that resulted when Britain pulled out in 1948. The failure of the peace process, many times over, in addition to their own statements, clearly spells this out, going back to their rejection of the Peel commission in 1939 which would have granted a Jewish state 1/3 the size of what it is now. 

&gt; So the thing is that it's wrong when other people do this thing as well. The US's occupation of Afghanistan was also wrong. Russia charging into Ukraine was also wrong. The US entering Vietnam was also wrong. Most of these things also had plenty of protests against it's not an israel specific protest since there were also protests for a lot of these things as well.

You're taking other conflicts where you've identified the opressor/opressed and think you can slap the same framework onto this one. 10/7 was particularly bad BECAUSE the situation was proceeding towards normalization since the last was in 2021 and Israel had its guard down, permitting up to 20,000 Gazans to enter Israel to work \*per day\*. If you think this is unfair the situation is analogous to if the USA let in 20,000 people per day from a state controlled by Al Qaeda per day with the number growing. You know what there was on 10/6? A ceasefire that had been in place since May 2021. You know who broke it? Hamas. 

&gt; But you might just be ignorant to the conditions that lead to these groups forming in the first place.

No, you're ignorant. I know fully well the history of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, it turning into the PLA, warring with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (basically those that have a vision of a secular state vs. Islamists like PIJ and Hamas), the failure of the peace process, etc. I have literally followed it my whole life - they dragged us out of Hebrew school in 2nd grade to watch the signing of the Oslo accords while our teachers said, ""this is it kids, peace within 5 years"". 

&gt; Again there is a distinction between the state of Israel and actual Jewish people.¬†

Calling for the destruction of a sovereign state is genocidal, period. 

&gt; Also, most of the protest on this campus that I've been to usually involve chants about the number of people dead and things like that, I think that's been the main focus of this protest.

I've been following this my whole life. It wasn't always about ""from the river to the sea"", it used to be ""roll back to '67 borders!"" about 20 years ago. The call for the elimination of Israel has only gone mainstream last 10-15 years or so. If you missed it on the days you attended, ok, cool, but I've been following this forever and have seen it plenty. There's plenty of footage of people calling for it at almost every protest if you do not believe me based on your limited exposure.

  
&gt; Red Herring. We were talking about the scale of innocent death on both sides. Who should/shouldn't agree to a peace treaty is a different conversation than who is killing more innocent people.

No. It is critical to understanding the current political situation and also understanding why the left wing is practically non-existent in Israel at this point regarding the conflict; Jews have tried to solve things with a pen for over 76 years (if you go back to the Peel Commission), the Arab response has always been to solve things through war, it goes badly for them, they keep losing more and more, yet keep doubling down. I have my own theories why- that this is a matter of culture that's unfortunately insurmountable because signing a peace treaty and formally living under Jews is not something they can accept because it would violate their sense of honor.",4,1715889986.0,t1_l4cf5g4

What UAW is arguing - student conduct rules should NEVER apply to UAW student workers, full immunity. That's inequitable and unfair.

Let's say 40 students have **academic integrity violations** pending against them because of a massive cheating scandal, and some of them happen to be UAW student workers. If some of those students could be facing temporary suspensions (in their capacity as students at UCSD), is UAW going to argue that because the student employees \*employment\* status is dependent on their \*student\* status, as you do above, that these ""workers"" are automatically immune from any academic integrity sanctions?

There is no difference between scenario I outlined above and what's happening in regards to student conduct violations and interim suspensions (which were all lifted as far as I understand, a month ago!).

1dapgzk,l7ql51n,SecondAcademic779,"Protesters DO have a right to free speech, but it doesn't include the rights to camp anywhere they want. Camping was never allowed. It does not include creating exclusionary zones on campus. These rules apply to all groups, regardless of their political or UAW affiliation.

Free speech has always had restrictions. You cannot yell ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater, you cannot disrupt classes for your political cause, etc.

If you choose to break those rules, especially after being repeatedly told not to break them because there are consequences, there will be consequences - student conduct (SAGE) proceedings where you may get interim suspensions and then double-secret probations, but basically it's a slap on a wrist and nothing really affects you as long as you go through the process, because the goal is to educate and correct behavior rather than punish students (corrective rather than punitive).

If you think the student policies are wrong - advocate to change them. But selective enforcement of the rules, and selective ""amnesty"" based on whether the people it applies to are aligned with your views politically is anti-equity, and discriminatory. It's like saying you are Ok with police pulling over black and brown people while letting white people go about their day, for the same minor traffic infraction (speeding, running stop signs you name it).

There was no ""police brutality"". Protesters were told to disperse, most did. The remaining people were told to disperse, every 15 min, 4 times, or else they will be detained. They opted to stay so they could get arrested, so they did. Police were polite and professional. There were no ""sniper"" rifles, those were beanie-bag guns for crowd control. The riot gear was because police are professionals and wear protective gear to prepare for the worst - and they did have to use it when protesters staged a riot and prevented the police bus from moving. You can't chant ""there is no riot here, why are you in riot gear?"" and then stage a riot 5 min later, requiring riot gear, that's hypocrisy.

Notice I never mentioned Palestine or Israel. The above applies to all protests, regardless of the cause. KKK and White Nationalists should be treated the same as SJP, they are governed by the same rules. 

Equity starts with everyone following the same rules. Once you start demanding that UAW members or certain political protests get different treatment, that's inequality. If you want to argue UAW members are above the law, say that openly - or, if you believe in equality under the law for everyone - say that then.

""Suspending students without a formal disciplinary process"" is called ""interim suspension"" and is part of standard academic sanctions that always existed.

The rules related to student code of conduct exist independently of anyone's employee status and apply to all students.

From ULP itself:

*On May 1, 2024, University Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla emailed all UC San Diego employees and students. The email declared that the encampment ""is a violation of university policy"" and stated that sanctions for violating University policy include ""****interim suspension****, suspension, dismissal or legal action.""*

On **May 6th** letters of interim suspension went out to 40 individuals who violated student code of conduct, with a interim suspension hearing scheduled for **May 10th**. Anyone who engaged in the SAGE process got their interim suspensions revoked the same day. So those interim suspensions lasted 5 days - yet the drama kings and queens involved really want to turn themselves into martyrs/victims.

So UAW decided to press the ridiculous ULP full of misinformation and lies, well past this date, which essentially argues that any UAW member is ""above the law"" and is not subject to student conduct, like everyone else.

Here's the relevant and old policy, including references to PACAOS and PPM:

**INTERIM ACTIONS**¬†

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Any sanction authorized by PACAOS Section 105.00, or these¬†*Procedures*¬†may be assigned on an interim basis by the Director - SAGE or their designee in consultation with the Dean or their designee or the Executive Director of the Center for Student Involvement or their designee. In imposing such interim action, the Director - SAGE or their designee will attempt to ensure that a¬†Student¬†or Student Organization will only be restricted to the minimum extent necessary when their participation in University-Supported Activities, use of¬†University¬†resources, or presence on University Property is¬†reasonably likely¬†to lead to:

¬†a.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Physical harm to any person or property;

b.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Threats of violence;

c.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person; or

Encampment is against university policy. If you were to become a part of the encampment, you would be breaking the campus rules. That's what the pamphlet you were handed was all about.

You never answered my question - which law was broken by taking a photo of you in a public space, where there is no expectation of privacy?

Let me give you an analogy - a person is next to your car with a crowbar, looking through the windows for any valuables, and you have a suspicion they may try to break into it. Or, if that works better - a guy is standing next to your locked bike with a cable cutters.

You tell them breaking into cars (or stealing bikes) is illegal and take their photo.

Iraq if we look at 3 cities that saw some of the wars biggest battles, even the smallest had about double the Sq miles to work with, which was fallujah at 250 Sq mi.

They took their land. They are in their rights to take it back by force.

nonetheless, if you‚Äôre concerned, you should definitely take some self defense classes and/or carry a deterrent weapon like pepper spray. going about terrified that you‚Äôll be victimized by the first bigot you encounter is no way to live, and that‚Äôll be true for the rest of your life. will you need those skills at ucsd? almost certainly not, but they‚Äôll probably make you more comfortable. will you need those skills later in life? again, probably not ‚Äî but if you do, they might save your life. as long as you have some confidence in your ability to protect yourself, that‚Äôs what matters

1hb9xiu,m1eqrlq,Adventurous-Metal696,"It sucks you got appendicitis, and great to see that (it seems) you're okay.  That said, there is so much going on here:

(1) You're upset with your instructor because they didn't answer your email at 5 or 6 AM?  You do realize that course instructors are human and need sleep, right?

(2) Even if your instructor set an alarm for 4 AM because they envisioned the possibility of a student emergency, what would you have expected them to do?  They could offer you the incomplete.  Maybe they could offer you an alternative exam time before grades are due, but that depends on all kinds of other issues, including whether you'll be well enough in time for that to happen.

(3) As u/ImportantScience9417 correctly points out, by emailing the instructor, you've documented that an issue came up BEFORE the final, and you're all set.  Any reasonable instructor would take that as sufficient evidence for an alternative to the final or for an incomplete grade.

(4) Wrong call to decide to leave the ER to take your exam.  Your life was truly at risk, and risking it for an exam was the wrong thing to do.  Other students reading this, don't do this!

I know that it's your last quarter but I don't believe they would charge you anything extra since you wouldn't be enrolling in any units the following quarter.

I'm sorry this happened to you and hope you have a speedy recovery, it's definitely frustrating dealing with a crisis on top of finals esp. when you're unsure of what to do.

I genuinely had a lot of love and appreciation for Rubios mainly because that was my first job right out of High School (2018), which taught me a lot on how to manage and live my life as a UCSD student (math and engineering) and as a person. Juggling that customer service job when Rubios was at its peak AND 2 STEM subjects at the same time was an interesting Hell I don‚Äôt wish upon anyone, but it built a lot of my character haha. I then left involuntarily because of the pandemic (and cause the District Manager was eager to ‚Äúfire me‚Äù [he meant lay off, but he said the actual word ‚Äúfire‚Äù on the call I had with him]), got a job as a UCSD Campus ID Printer, and did not return to the store until after I graduated in 2022.

When I returned, was already working 2 jobs with a 3rd one on the way; I working as a temporary analyst for UCSD, teacher, and engineering intern. So Rubios became a 4th job I returned to willingly. To those who may ask why, it was because of the main manager of the store, a man who I genuinely consider a brother to this day. When the store came back from the pandemic, he was asking me to come back to help keep the store afloat since I was a senior (and one of his best) members of the team; to which I promised him I would eventually (since I had another Job and school), all because I wanted him and the team to succeed.

I never regretted any of my moments I created when I came back to work there. From saying absolutely stupid and idiotic jokes about how water is free, to helping customers figure out their best bang for their buck, to bantering with my co-workers, to yelling ‚Äú69‚Äù at the top of my lungs to get a laugh from someone in the crowd, being a Rubios cashier was a release I had from my own personal stressful life I‚Äôm leading today.

As of now, I‚Äôm actually at 1 job, but not by my own choice. I was at the end of my contract with the analyst position in October, taxes messed me up so badly that I had to give up my internship (which is my dream job), and now Rubios is officially gone. But even with this situation, I know things are only going to go up. For instance, I‚Äôm still a teacher and tutor currently hosting a course for summer, and I‚Äôm currently applying and interviewing for positions that get me closer to my goal of becoming a design engineer. So with this tragic scene in this movie, the climax of this is yet to happen I feel.

Now, I could take this moment to rib on Rubios as a corporation cause I have a lot I would want to say and expose (like that idiotic surcharge that had no value in applying) but it‚Äôs not my place, and it‚Äôs not the point of this reply. Just know that all the criticisms and issues that some of you customers had with the UCSD location, I 100% agreed with those grievances and actively did things to try to mitigate it or complain to corporate on y‚Äôall‚Äôs behalf (even if I or the store got in a bit of trouble).

If you went to Rubios regularly, and I took your order (you all know who you are), thank you for being a customer with the restaurant, and thank you for being friendly back! I genuinely appreciated taking your orders, chatting with you briefly, and serving you food I personally made sure was quality. If you took an order with me in general, I thank you for coming over, and I hope you had a good experience being served with us (even if I was intense or loud at times).

I only share this all to really emphasize that working at the store was never a chore for me personally, especially for the positions I was in in life. I found it personally gratifying being your cashier and server for roughly 5 to 6 years, and I‚Äôm truly going to miss those years. I‚Äôm still grieving a bit personally, but I am also very excited about what the next step will be. Until next time, thank you very much, and please enjoy your meal!",169,1717653323.0,t3_1d94l0c

Starbucks: they have no branches in Israel at all. The only reason they are ""boycotted"" is the following story.

Starbucks, who is long known for fighting worker unions, used the opportunity to legally claim this union is illegitimate for supporting terrorists. This is it. They have no ties to Israel, besides denouncing Hamas for their own financial reasons.

In Columbia, the ""demands"" included divesting from Microsoft, Google and Amazon (for having offices in Israel), from Booking.com and Airbnb (for renting hotels in Israel) and from Boeing (because planes are used in wars).

Ahh, this is the part of your diatribe where you totally shift the focus elsewhere because you can't prove your original claim, but I'll indulge you.

Europeans are not indigenous to West Asia. I don't care how much map bending you do. Zionism originated from Europe, and 80%+ of Israeli Jews were European in 1948. How do Europeans have a right to commit genocide, systemic rape, mass expulsion of almost 1 million people, and land theft?

Where are Palestinians from? Well they're a semitic people from the Levant. I'd like to think these kind of things are taught at UCSD...

&gt; They are the colonizers as they have now colonized what, 25+ countries?

Anything but focus on the actual colonizing country at hand. You won't find a single instance of Arabs doing what zionists did to the Palestinians in 1948 &amp; onward. Arab being the lingua franca =/= colonialism.

Let's look at DNA then. Palestinians descend from canaanites, yet they're being ethnically cleansed from land they never lef. Where are your cries for them? Why do you feel as if a pseudo-religious ethnostate has the right over the people who lived on the land?

Again, are Europeans indigenous to West Asia? It's a resounding, no.

&gt; Palestinians"" from a genetic point of view

There's also no such thing as Navajo (Dine) DNA or Cherokee DNA, and as a matter of fact, no genealogy can identify a specific tribe DNA. There's also no USA DNA, or Israel DNA (where DNA tests are illegal), or Prussian DNA or German DNA (unless youre going to argue Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Icelandic, English and French people are part of this German DNA). The reality is that DNA doesn't really tell us about how people organize their own political identities. What is your point?

&gt; there are literally DOZENS of times Jews have been ethnically cleansed from a region.

Are we including the times Zionists kidnapped thousands of Yemeni Jewish Children? Are including the time where Colonial occupation authorities collaborated with zionists to forcefully deport Arabian Jews to [Israel](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/big-story/truth-behind-israeli-propaganda-expulsion-arab-jews&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi1sfLd0pKGAxXDDTQIHXRhDwEQFnoECBMQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0wzWK28f3F-NoIynX5tu9Y)? Are we including the times where zionists bombed Arabian Synogogues? You can learn more from Tom Segev, the Israeli Jewish historian who researched this üòä. Jewish migration to Israel is a mixture of zionist opportunism to settle on Palestinian land, and the occasional seizure of property belonging to Jews. There was no instance of genocide of Jews in the Arab world.

When it comes to flags representing national or shared identities you're potentially opening up a can of worms. But it doesn't always work that way.

American Flag - Could go so many ways. Neo-nazis in charlottesville parading through the streets with american flags. What does that tell you? Is this a problematic flag? An american flag *CAN*  imply support for racist groups such as 3%er

  
All to say: No, the Palestinian flag by no means implies support of hamas...although Hamas is supported by palistinians because they see hamas as the only people fighting for their collective emancipation.

Fairly certain you can't freely live as a gay married couple in a number of muslim majority nations.

Hamas did execute a man for allegedly embezzling funds to pay for gay sex. You can argue that they executed him for the embezzlement, but they do [imprison people for being gay as well](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/middle-east/palestinian-territories/1660138495-exclusive-gay-man-who-fled-gaza-speaks-about-experience-with-hamas).",0,1715911185.0,t1_l4dyx8u

Otherwise marriage ceremonies would be allowed to be preformed. For a marriage to be recognised it means that your paperwork has to be wholly accepted by the government, because Israel won‚Äôt allow for marriage ceremonies that aren‚Äôt religious, it means that the paperwork is never wholly accepted. Thus invariable leading to queer folks being second class citizens. That‚Äôs the thing about ‚Äúwe recognize marriages done somewhere else‚Äú laws unfortunately. It‚Äôs not actually any different than gay marriage being illegal. Think about pre-2015 US, you could get married in California but not Texas, and while the marriage was recognized in Texas, it also wasn‚Äôt really.

Secondly, I didn‚Äôt say that those countries didn‚Äôt exist, I just said that that it doesn‚Äôt constitute most Muslim-majority countries. 

Thirdly, I wasn‚Äôt saying people don‚Äôt get jailed or killed either. I said they do in fact. I was however saying that talking about people being pushed off of roofs or stoned, are dog whistles that signal a lack of education and diligent research. It‚Äôs also blatant misinformation and incendiary language meant to stir a false sense of righteousness from homophobes who don‚Äôt actually care about queer people in the global south. 

My family‚Äôs Thai, and I‚Äôm gay, the legality of queerness in these regions is something that genuinely affects and concerns me.

Such a reach. There aren't even any Starbucks *in* Israel. It's also publicly traded company for fucks sake. Protesting at every store where one of the large shareholders supports Israel is such an idiotic concept.

&gt;also Starbucks keeps union busting, illegally, constantly. Illegal union busting is a repeated behavior that Starbucks still does.

Cool, except your movement about *Palestine*. Stop shoehorning random shit in.


&gt;On top of that Starbucks sued its own union for supporting Palestinian genocide survivors.

Wildly out of context. Starbucks sued them for their logo infringing on their copyright because of backlash against *Starbucks* for the *unions* stance on the conflict. It also really wasn't a good look to post ""solidarity with Palestine"" on October 9th.

&gt;So, SJP protested the Starbucks set up in the building that our own university pays for. That protest is good, that's a good thing that happened

To you maybe. To many people it's stupid as fuck.

&gt;Activism movements need ""yes, and"" energy. If you're not satisfied with the current protests then genuinely please connect with the movement yourself and try investing time out of your schedule to organize events that you think will result in positive change.

Why? Why would protesting everything tangentially related help your movement? You dilute your message and create cracks amongst your own supporter base. I'm sure that some of the people who went to the encampment like getting Starbucks and disagree. Over what? A coffee shop that doesn't even do business in Israel.

&gt;Personally all this rage at activists for not protesting the ""perfect"" way is falling for the scapegoat and rage that should be directed at the government and police. It's the perfect victim fallacy

Or it's because the activism is being done stupidly. You don't get a free pass on optics just because you believe in something. Plan better protests that don't make you look like out of touch idiots chasing the next hip cause.

&gt;The 1950s Montgomery bus boycotts and the 1960s lunch sit ins for protesting segregation.

You know what else these protests did? They directly addressed the thing they were protesting.

I wasn't CS at UCSD but Math-CS. I graduated in 2018 which was much better than today and managed to land work as a SWE in about 3 months. Leetcode and such will be important but I'd try to go over behavioral questions and soft technical skills with any friends you made over the years. Practice talking about your projects and make sure you detail those. You got this you earned the degree and you'll get work try not to hyperfixiate on cscareerquestions and csmajors those places aren't necessarily tied to reality the market isn't great but it isn't that bad. In San Diego check out the NIWC new professionals program and also look at some of the government companies there's a decent amount of hiring going on.

1ctlhgs,l4rez3o,Agile-Scientist-8926,"Hello OP,

Thank you for your post.

I'm curious to know why you or anyone else cares at all about this? 

If you it is really that important to you, why? 

You did express not being in favor of non students commenting. I guess that makes some sense. But is it the right thing to be concerned about? While UCSD is a private school, it is open to the public. 

Reddit is available to anyone who signs up. Since this is on Reddit, we can't keep people out just because they are not something. 

Not to get carried away, but you have to see that what you are suggesting is a low key form of discrimination. It's racist. It's elitist. And on top of all that, it infringes on freedom of speech. So it's violated civil rights. 

I know you might not see that or think it's not such a big deal. Or it's only one thing. But it is still all of those things. 

Also, let's just say for arguments sake, that only students on here. Which at least holds some water. But, you aren't saying that, you are singling out one group. Why would the other side not be mentioned?

As far as the comments about police and other things. It's freedom of speech on a public form.

Last note, it's funny you mentioned people being paid. I not sure if anyone else has noticed, but both sides have older adults mixed in. They both have people aren't students. I might be losing my mind with finals and all. But I swear that I've seen some of those older adults in the pro- Palestine group, in the BLM protests.

Also, I'm not sure about the Israel side being paid. It's a good question. But I've read and seen a lot of evidence that the Pro P side pays some of those same older people.",1,1716139912.0,t3_1ctlhgs

This union represents more than 35,000 Service workers (SX), Patient Care Technical workers (EX), Skilled Craft workers (K7), and more across all UCs, several medical centers, clinics, and research laboratories. Amongst their demands are fair wages, affordable housing, job security, safe staffing, and affordable care, as they are negotiating a new contract. The vote has called for a strike on November 20th-21st with the local UCSD union holding picket lines at UCSD Central Campus, UCSD La Jolla Med Center, and UCSD Hilcrest Med Center.

I made some friends along the way but not very many. Like you, my parents and my then girlfriend are the only ones who watched me graduate. 

After UC San Diego, I went to grad school elsewhere. When I graduated, again, only my family and then girlfriend attended my graduation. 

I came back to San Diego and worked hard at my profession and enjoyed moderate success. Then I ventured out into the San Diego community and ran into people I met at UCSD. I rose in the ranks of various nonprofit groups and met more people who attended UCSD when I did. I ultimately became President of the UC San Diego Alumni Association. 

Life is a journey and your time at UC San Diego is just one step a long the way. What matters more is what you do with your education and experience after UCSD. Believe in yourself. If you don‚Äôt, no body else will. And you and you alone, control that.

If I had to be frank, what drew my ire towards the protestors was the cancelation of sungod. Sure, the protestors here at UCSD can claim to be peaceful, but the problem that they seem to have trouble identifying, that or they don't care, is that they are associated with a nation-wide effort that has engaged in, lets say, less than peaceful protesting. And now, because of that association, everything that occurs around these protestors has to be quadruple checked to ensure things don't get out of hand and risk police intervention. 

Imho, if the protestors want to gain legitimate traction towards their goals, they'd start by denouncing what some of their more extreme comrades are doing at other schools. What those protestors did at Columbia and UCLA was absolutely disgraceful and the filth they left in their wake eliminated any legitimacy and good will in my eyes.",-33,1714884362.0,t3_1ckifkv

Being fired at with rubber bullets and subjected to tear gas by riot control officers in order to restore society's accepted standard of law and order is an objective bearing on whether or not the protestors are right or wrong. In the cases of Columbia and UCLA, the protestors were clearly wrong. Any argument to the contrary is delusional.

Admin cancelled sungod as a direct result of the concerns brought up due to the presence of protestors. It's simple cause and effect.

Why arent there protests going on outside their offices? I'm not denying that universities aren't a business, but they aren't the big money pushers the protestors are making them out to be, comparatively speaking. As for the protests at Columbia and UCLA, they may have started peacefully, but they eventually devolved into violence and the destruction of campus property, requiring police intervention. So to say they were ""targeted,"" is false as intervention was instigated as a result of their actions. In both instances, it was clear the protestors had zero regard for how there actions interfered with the student body, so the justification that protests are meant to be disruptive while simultaneously hiding behind banner of peace is just disgraceful trash.

Dental plans usually have an annual allowance. This is the maximum amount of money they will pay out in a year. If UCSHIP allowance is $1,750, then all other charges will not be covered.  
I still think that you need to go over the bill with your provider.

The going rate for a root canal is around $1,000-$1,300, carried out by an Endodontist. If this was done by a general dentist, the rate should be lower.

They should also have told you any part that would not be covered by your insurance.

Some people can crank sheer volume of applications and will land a job through pure statistics. Others (I‚Äôm in this second camp) are better at networking and find a job that way.

I basically started going to meetups and doing personal projects that were relevant to my career, and then I hit people up in industry NOT for a job but for advice and discussion about my personal projects. I eventually talked to someone at my current company and they were impressed enough by the conversation we had where they pointed me to their internship and I got it, which turned to a full time position after six months.

Also‚Ä¶ no shame at all in working in food service. I‚Äôve fallen back to bussing tables many times in my life to support me in transitional periods. Just keep your eyes on the prize.

1cwa94u,l4wbymi,they_are_out_there,"It's definitely not ""what you know"", so much as ""who you know"".

It happens in hiring and it happens everyday when people get together. It's well known that more deals seem to be made on the golf course than at the conference table. People tend to be more agreeable when relaxed and when someone is showing interest in them and how they do things at their company.

Cold calling and sending in mass applications is a tough way to job hunt. Networking, job fairs where you can meet, shake hands, talk about your experience, and internships all work for a reason, they personalize you and make people more likely to make a connection for hiring.

In my decades of working, every single job I've ever gotten was due to connecting with someone and getting to know them, securing a referral from a friend, professor, or relative, or just talking with a company rep and inviting them out to coffee and expressing interest in them and their company. That will make you stand out above the rest of the masses. You need to be creative to stand out in this job market, just be conservative and sensible about it, as you don't want to go over the top and look weird, etc. 

If you're a decent human and come across as likeable, it's a rare individual that will turn down a free coffee and pastry just for the sake of hearing you out for a little while. Don't go full court press, just get to know them and get them talking about themselves, how they got involved with the company, what they like, and how they've succeeded. With time, they'll ask about you and that's when you'll have a chance to step up to the plate.

Getting to know someone and how they do their job, researching their company so you can show them how you can fit in and benefit them, and making that personal connection is the tough part, but it's also the most effective method, short of having a Nobel Prize on your resume.

This will definitely make it more likely that you'll have a chance to get in. You'll still probably have to submit an online application and all of that, but at least this way, you'll stand out from the faceless masses who are applying for the same jobs. Good luck.",40,1716224083.0,t1_l4umq19

1cr5bcr,l3vve6n,[deleted],"Sorry to hear all that you‚Äôre going through OP. I know this isn‚Äôt possible for everyone, but have you looked into mental health care resources? That‚Äôs a lot to be dealing with on top of school. I remember being in a similar situation when I was in undergrad and for me, the lack of motivation was a result of clinical depression (and the stress of school made it worse). I tried everything to fix it on my own but it literally wasn‚Äôt possible without outside help in my case. I can honestly say getting professional made a big difference in my life and in my grades. (And my parents initially did not support this either, they‚Äôre the type that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt believe in mental health‚Äù but once they saw the difference in my grades they started coming around a little bit). 

Again I know it isn‚Äôt for everyone, but I just wanted to put it out there as a possible option. CAPS isn‚Äôt the best resource in the world imo but it at least helped get me started in the right direction.

Sad but hard reality is your parents may never fully ‚Äúget it,‚Äù but you shouldn‚Äôt have to suffer because of that. Gotta do whatever is right for you and prioritize your health.",52,1715624172.0,t3_1cr5bcr

- getting suffocated and losing my hearing everytime I needed to cook since there's no ventilation whatsoever in the kitchen so the alarms would always go off.

- being woken in the middle of the night because the walls are paper thin (really appreciate my neighbors debating politics at 3am on finals week tho)

As expected, they have raised rent each year, but they actually haven't come close to maxxing out and increasing 10%, it's consistently been more like 3%, even with the new management. The apartments are definitely old and have some weird issues (for example, the fridge I have is quite old and it seems like it was re-painted to hide rust, with paint that comes off when you wipe the fridge with a sponge...) but that predates this management and none of these issues have been substantial.

From my understanding, the UAW Executive Board will now begin calling on individual campuses to begin striking. Given that the police response at UCSD is cited as a main reason for the vote, it seems likely that UCSD academic workers will be called to strike.",51,1715828917.0,t3_1ct2y3s

The rank and file academic workers must take this struggle into their own hands and build rank and file committees that are politically independent. It's not a coincidence the UAW bureaucracy has endorsed ""genocide joe"" and gives millions in workers dues money to the Democratic party which is an imperialist pro genocide anti-working class party.

When the UAW formally endorsed Biden for re-election, they also had anti-genocide protestors dragged out by police. The rank and file workers must not let this struggle be sabotaged, and the strike must be expanded!

I live in San Diego and we intervened in the 2022 UC strike, so I was at those picket lines many times, and we were warning academic workers then of the incoming betrayal by the UAW bureacracy (the demands of that strike were no where near met and the strike was sabotaged from the start by the UAW bureaucracy). We have been reporting on the campus encampments and the violent police response around the country and world.

We reach out to workers of all types, and we tell them the truth. These union burcreacies function as undemocratic institutions that conspire with management. They are also far from politically independent with their deep ties to ruling class political parties that are hostile to workers. They have also overseen a massive decline in workers living standards over decades.

Because we tell this essential truth, there are many opportunists and burcreats that smear us and are hostile to us. We don't shy away from the communist label, but we are Trotskyists (opposed to Stalinism), and have a rich history in opposing imperialism and fighting for the political independence of the working class. 

There are no dishonest intentions here, simply sharing information that is ruthlessly suppressed and critical to the building of a mass working class movement against imperialism that is actually capable of ending the Gaza genocide and drive to world war.

The UAW bureaucracy is already in the works of sabotaging this strike with their ""stand up strike"" non-sense, and if workers really want their struggle to be effective, they must build politically independent and democratic rank and file committees.",-3,1715916180.0,t1_l4eh0kd

There was a great reason to have a union due to the visa abuse by faculty, and no healthcare for spouses, and major cost of living problems for post docs and students. 

But now we have a strike based on political beliefs. IMO A major overreach by the union. 

They say 80% voted in favor but i notice their website says: 

&gt;The vote will be **conducted online** and all UAW 4811 members in good standing will be eligible to take part.

How many people voted? Who was alerted to the vote? 

A lot of grad students/postdocs probably didn't vote

I note there is no quorum requirement in the UAW bylaws:

1cuej91,l4m7mca,unalienation,"It‚Äôs copied from the strategy UAW pursued in the strike with the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù auto companies last fall. They didn‚Äôt strike all labor at once, they added new factories to the strike each week. This allowed UAW to conserve its strike pay resources as well as modulate the pressure it was exerting on each individual company. For example, if Ford was playing ball that week at the negotiation table, they wouldn‚Äôt get a new strike that week. Adds an adjustable carrot-stick dynamic to strike strategy. That¬†strategy was seen as very effective in the Big 3 negotiations.¬†

So that‚Äôs the inspiration. In this context I think it‚Äôs a way to limit the strike. This is my own interpretation, I don‚Äôt have contacts among current union leadership. But I think they felt they had to do something, but also grasped that this is a unique situation largely out of their control‚Ä¶much depends on what‚Äôs happening on the ground in Gaza and on Capitol Hill in the U.S. In a situation of that much uncertainty, union leadership doesn‚Äôt want to be pot committed right off the bat. Going one at a time (and announcing a sell-by date they won‚Äôt strike past, June 30), the union can avoid getting caught holding the bag with an unwieldy, weak, open-ended strike if (1) interest turns out to be low or (2) admin digs in its heels.¬†

UCSC has been seen as the most radical UC for a while, so leadership likely sees it as the best opportunity to show the strength of the strike. I expected them to target LA first since that‚Äôs where the most egregious admin response has been, but SC also makes some sense from a tactical perspective.¬†",2,1716048694.0,t1_l4lxl93

The ""stand up"" strike technique is blatant sabotage, workers striking are not stronger with a divided picket line. The strike must be expanded and workers must form rank and file committees in order to take the struggle into their own hands.

There is no world socialist website ""black pill"", the WSWS is very clear in its insistence on the power of the working class and there is nothing nihilistic about what we say. The working class is extremely militant in the US and internationally and ready to fight, it's fundementally a question of leadership. There is no reason to doubt the working classes capability of overcoming the sabotage and hostility of union burcreacies, and the WSWS never indicates anything of the sort.

The real ""black pill"" is what these union burcreats are gonna work out behind closed doors that they will try to sell workers, and do their best to convince them it's the best they can get, just like they did in 2022. That is the real dishonest nihilism at play here. Workers need to be more than ""skeptical of leadership"" they need to form new leadership and realize that these union Burcreacies are not on their side.

Reddit specifically carves out public figures in their rule, and as an influencer (for lack of a better word) Avaneesh fit into that.

Additionally the posts were typically just images of his actual content he posted, so it was all stuff he had explicitly chosen to post online under his real name. So there was nothing to doxx in that case. 

Now I still think we potentially ran afoul in some regards so as a result adjusted our approach as time went on, but even in the worst case I'd say the posts were typically borderline.

I recommend checking it out - the restaurants there are really good.

Muir Woods was the same size, they just really reorganized the building. It used to be that the smaller area to the left was where you ordered your drinks, and then the right side had a snack shop where the bar is now. They also used to have special seasonal drinks that changed every quarter, and I miss that a lot (but thank god they still make the Polar Bear, I think that's probably their most popular drink).

As for the restaurants, Showa Ramen, Tahini, and Fan-Fan at NTPLLN are all *REALLY* good. I'm also a big fan of Santorini, at Price Center. Tapioca Express, also at Price Center, is *okay,* it's not great but their boba is at least passable and the food is fine. On my last day I found out about Crafted, at Franklin Antonio Hall, their kimchi fried chicken sandwich is *excellent* but their boba is straight-up the worst boba I've ever had.

Furthermore - there was absolutely no targeting of students on the basis of their UAW status - the university had no knowledge whether the students who were alleged to have violated the code of conduct are student employees or not, therefore it cannot be interpreted as labor issue.

An example - if a group of students are beligerent and intoxicated at a party and assault someone, and the campus initiates student conduct process, but it turns out that one or several of those students also happen to be student employees, this does not mean that UAW can claim that labor laws were violated and UAW members were targeted.",2,1715956227.0,t1_l4exixk

It outlines the exact process the university must go through before either dismissing, or suspending a student worker from their job without pay. The argument made by the UAW here is that UC is suspending students employees' jobs without pay and thereby circumventing the entire process mandated in the contract.

No holds or emails saying you‚Äôd get kicked out, but there were delays in stuff like appointment times and people had to EASy request to meet prerequisites. Pretty sure it took them until winter quarter to finish everything up. I‚Äôm not surprised they managed to screw up again but I am kind of surprised that it‚Äôs this much worse. 

A loosely related anecdote- this past spring quarter CSE debuted a new class and they managed to screw up the sections *after* people enrolled. CSE just had everyone drop and re-enroll. Point is, enrollment is more often a shitshow than not and even if everything goes wrong it‚Äôs probably still fine.",16,1723673478.0,t1_li4yoil

IMO the CSE department continues to make poor decisions followed by poor planning. I mean-- virtually every CSE class I've taken has not had enough tutoring, yet when you apply to be a CSE tutor you just never get a response unless you actually got a position. Applicants are left totally in the dark...",4,1723679197.0,t1_li59itl

Source: was tutor and TA and talked to a lot of TAs about their classes 

Also I hated the left in the dark thing too, but I figured out why it's like that. It's not a traditional application where you can be rejected, it's more like an interest form. Professors go through people who chose their class and pick their recommendations, the department approves them almost all of the time, and whatever legal reviews happen too. But if they don't choose you, that doesn't mean anything - they aren't ""denying"" you at all and it's still entirely possible you get a position later 

I literally got hired for a TA position that was accidentally forgotten about (and thus I didn't technically apply for since it wasn't an option), and the week before class starts (*after* the start of the quarter) I got an email asking if I would do it lol. So they couldn't have ""rejected"" me earlier anyways

It's true that if you're voting in California there's little you can do to affect the presidential election, but there's a lot of other elections, including for California props and San Diego measures on this ballot.

For example, one prop will allow cities to enforce rent control again, but this could also be used to discourage building new housing.

 I just did this and Prop E is an example of where you need to read the actual text of the proposition and not just read the ballot summary to understand what you are voting for.

Here is the ballot summary for Prop E: ""To invest in neighborhood upgrades which can include fixing potholes, repairing streets, sidewalks, and streetlights, improving parks and libraries, updating police, fire, paramedic, and 9-1-1 response, and providing infrastructure and delivering general services across San Diego neighborhoods, shall the measure enacting a one-cent sales tax be adopted, generating approximately $400,000,000 per year until ended by voters, requiring citizen oversight and independent audits, with all funds staying in the City of San Diego?""

Now if you read the text of the proposition, look at section 32.0115 it states (bold is by me) ""The proceeds from this tax imposed by this ordnance s**hall be for unrestrictive general revenue purposes** of the City and shall be received into the General Fund of the city. **Nothing in this ordinance shall establish the tax imposed under this ordnance as a special tax or bind the City to use the proceeds for any special purpose or function**. The Mayor and City Council shall **retain discretion to expend the proceeds of the tax for any lawful purpose of the City**"" 

In section 32.0117: ""The proceeds from the transaction and use tax under this ordinance shall be subject to the same independent annual audit requirements as other General Fund revenue"" ...",3,1729268272.0,t1_ls31reb

Just voting yes on 33 doesn't do ANYTHING - local rent control laws still need to be passed.

1eifbru,lg67zfe,Choice-Breadfruit774,"PSA to UCSD students from the Berkeley community

Recently a meme was shared to our subeddit outlining a dismissive and disrespectful act that, often, many non-Berkeley students are guilty of,

 Please do not refer to Berkeley as ""UCB."" This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. Cal, Berkeley or UC Berkeley are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. UCB, on the other hand, is not.

 As the system's most prestigious and respected campus we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that ""UCB"" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.

 While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""UCB"" to refer our school.

 Thank you.

 TL:DR

Don't say ""UCB"" when referring to Berkeley",65,1722620159.0,t3_1eifbru

1clvdzj,l2wii2c,MsBeasley2583,"UCSD has a long history of using strong-arm and intimidation tactics on both students and faculty. I graduated in '91 and in '92 the administration shut down the General Store Co-op for something rather small - which they did regularly with other co-ops, and also with little negotiations. And more recently, they charged two grad students for writing in chalk on a building (I think at SIO) during a protest/picket - so incredibly overblown and rediculous, which is typical. They pretty much squash dissent and opposing voices. And yes, both students and faculty should be given the opportunity to vote No Confidence - as other universities have done. 

It may also help to write to the UC Board of Regents, as well as your elected reps - governor, state senator and assemblymember - and ask them to address the issue directly with the univsersity and to urge the university to drop charges and reverse all actions of academic discipline.
