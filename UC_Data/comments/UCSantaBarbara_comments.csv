I remember the vigor, and unwavering passion you guys had during the BLM, women’s marches, and similar movements because I was there and saw it first hand. I was so filled with joy and hope seeing you guys fight for a better future alongside me. you have your hearts in the right places, you just need to get out there, get significantly more involved in politics, especially local politics. go respectfully annoy your state representatives, go respectfully annoy city council members, go respectfully annoy your local government, so they know what you think, so they won’t forget who they’re working for and who they represent. 
Heres a link to find your local California representatives:

I recommend googling your local city council to get to know your city council members, meeting times, agendas, and how you can participate. There’s ways to participate surprisingly.

join local progressive political grassroots organizations, mobilize, and actually vote. Stop bitching online and encourage your friends to be more politically active and vote.

It's also a fact that their work gets exploited. That's not an endorsement of exploitation but a description of reality at the moment. It doesn't have to be this way. We could enact laws that make it easier to form unions, for example, which would keep the economic productivity while reducing exploitation.

And yes, Capitalism is an economic system that promotes shareholder profits above all else and which pretends that this is a good enough proxy for the health of the economy. It's not, and it's not even close. Corporations can accrue so much wealth and power that they can start to lobby governments, changing laws to benefit themselves while harming everybody else. Universal healthcare, for example, would simultaneously *save taxpayers money* while also guaranteeing a higher standard of living for all. But, it's bad for business. Which businesses? The middlemen, i.e. the insurance companies that profit from misery. And so they lobby for misery, and they win because they are wealthy and powerful. It's a big club, and we ain't in it.

So you can pretend that your immigration concerns are principled. That you've grounded them with serious economic understanding.

Why would you want an actual felon as your president? Felons can't even vote, so why the fuck is he in ballot? Why isn't that criminal behind bars? Answer the question.

There's nothing this man has done to actually get the praise that he has done, and he's nothing more than a scammer.  Your ""president"" is a joke, and it's a huge embarrassment when kamala was clearly more qualified.  

Until you guys answer the simple question on your hypocrisy, cult, and that orange hair loss gremlin.

1ci737i,l29alz7,Jeqlousy,"I can agree with that. A bit confused by both your articles.

1) I find the first one a bit disingenuous as it talks about the origins of Israel and then jumps to 1948 with little mention of events in between. A gross oversight in my opinion that it was only Jews that led to tense events and then Nakba. I do believe a majority of the blame lends to the Jews during the surrounding years, but worth pointing out the above.

To give a lil update:

The ""threat"" to end campbell hall finals turned out to be legitimate! My friend was taking an econ 2 final and had it interrupted right in the middle. The professor even stated ""we might get interrupted by protestors, so do as much as you can because once they come in we have to end the exam."" And that's exactly what happened, for econ 2, a weeder class. What a bunch of narcissistic brats

The want to push UCSB to use the police was successful. Hell, they brought out the whole army! (national guard? idk they were wearing camo) I am no fan of putting down free speech, but I do believe in a little thing called tough love, something the protestors' parents didn't use enough. You can say what you want, how you want, but you do NOT get to disrupt the lives of students WHO PAY TO GO HERE, who PAY TO USE THE PUBLIC FACILITIES HERE. Using the line ""protests are supposed to disrupt"" only goes to show how absolutely disconnected and detached you are from the reality that the majority of college students share: these protests suck, the university also sucks, and everyone is just making it worse as usual.

“National SJP, which is founded and controlled by AMP, is one group claiming to support hundreds of so-called “Palestine solidarity organizations” across the United States.

AMP has substantial ties to Hamas via its financial sponsor, Americans for Justice in Palestine Educational Foundation, Inc. (AJP), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. AJP is currently under investigation by the Virginia Attorney General for violating state charitable solicitation laws and ‘benefitting or providing support to terrorist organizations.’ Reportedly, current AMP board members have been involved in fundraising for Hamas charities… AMP is also linked to the Holy Land Foundation (HLF), which sent approximately $12.4 million outside the U.S. to support Hamas. Like the Islamic Association of Palestine (IAP), HLF was founded by members of Hamas senior leadership and was shut down due to five of its officers being convicted for terror financing”

Food insecurity, children living in poverty, people going bankrupt with medical bills, I sufficient and too expensive college educations, etc. 
2. The black takeover of North Hall was about those black people and what they were going through and what was literally happening on campus to them on a daily basis.

No one seriously confuses the mission of the DoD. They coat everything in obtuse language because if they didn’t it’d be difficult for those working there to read and live with themselves. But we all know when the engineering undergrads are dropping water balloons from drones with Raytheon what they’re aiming for. Why do you think everyone who works there needs govt clearance and NDAs? Only one pulling out of their ass is you brother.

1ddm320,l879d15,AeroArchonite_,"I worked in defense last summer; over the span of a year, I helped build a machine that destroys chemical weapons (primarily [UXO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexploded_ordnance) dug up inside the United States). This was not just DoD-funded, it was in collaboration with the Army. To say that all DoD work is for weapons is plainly false; you were able to write this comment because the DoD (under DARPA) funded the creation of the Internet.

Capstone projects are not military research. Any company that seriously utilized the work of a senior group project for its products, military or otherwise, would go out of business. Frankly, the capstone projects serve as a recruiting tool for senior engineering majors: a handful of people per decade will find it cool and go work there. I would prefer if we did not have ""water delivery drone :)"" projects, but unless there's an alternate funding source, that's where the money comes from.

As for blanket classifications (NDAs are for proprietary info, i.e. business stuff, not 'military secrets'), they seek them out because it's cheaper. If all of your employees have the highest possible clearance, then you never have to worry about issuing separate badges, following even more government regulations, etc. It saves them money.",3,1718152973.0,t1_l8740tx

It’s their mission statement. Although what you worked on won’t kill anyone, it is still obviously for use in the context of warfare. And I don’t want to bash you for it; I understand very well that Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, etc all have different project divisions, and it’s commendable that you found something that wasn’t just a drone that drops “water balloons.” But let’s not kid ourselves by saying they aren’t devoted to being pmc’s. 

Of course these capstone projects are more for recruitment. But I don’t want war profiteers on campus grooming students to be cogs in their machine, and I at least want more funding sources for people who are not morally inclined to support such entities (there are a lot of us, as you might know).

I don't know if you're in engineering here or not, but I feel like pretty much all of the engineering jobs (outside of maybe civil engineering contractors, but they don't really pay well enough to afford rent here) are in defense. Lockheed, Raytheon, Teledyne, Leonardo, Boeing... if I want to stay in this county after graduation and afford food simultaneously it seems like the only option, and I don't have the means to take the moral stance and just not use my degree. Obviously I don't *have* to live in SB (and I probably won't), but it does irk me a lot when people assume there are a billion other high-paying, university-unaffiliated (as you pointed out, research dollars are typically vaguely or not-so-vaguely defense related) engineering jobs that are free for the taking and it's a purely personal choice to go into defense.

Increasing the tuition costs beyond what they already did during the 2010-2014 period would've put a disproportionate burden on the student body that had enrolled expecting a wildly different financial situation than what they experienced. 

The fact of the matter is they had to bridge a massive and unexpected budget shortfall when the CA legislature started slashing funding. The solution is imperfect but it was intentional in its spreading of the impact between current and future students. They needed more students NOW not in 5 - 10 years, and they needed to appeal to international and our of state students who are less concerned w campus housing options than some of us blue and gold plan riders. 

That all said, ill reiterate that I think the lack of any progress towards a long-term/sustainable solution is disappointing. I just don't think it's as simple as lots of the current student body makes it out to be",5,1723671513.0,t1_li4x5tl

That's not a rhetorical question, either. The answer is the administrative staff, it's just never gonna happen.

They've ballooned in number and pay relative to educators and students in the past few decades. The problem is the admin staff kinda has control over the budget for the administrative end of things. That's oversimplifying things in a huge way but at the end of the day they're not going to cannibalize themselves just like a HOA needs to find reasons to continue to exist. It's shitty, too, because there's lots of great people trying hard in those ranks that do really add value. There's just also a loooot of folks coasting, or so I've come to believe through my own experiences and light research into the issue.

Most people trying to convert you are nice lol, whether it’s genuine or not. Despite their kindness and the quality of their burgers, I’m inclined to agree with OP. They’re (mostly) uncomfortably old, occupying housing that UC and CC students desperately need, all to proselytize their religion. I’ve also heard a few unfortunate stories of borderline harassment from their members/leaders, but that’s nothing I can reasonably substantiate beyond a few accounts related to me.

Feel free to practice whichever religion you wish, but I find it highly condescending in the way they’d speak / act to their neighbors about ‘saving’ people and fighting the ‘sin’ they saw in the street. I find their outward kindness hollow. They can preach all they want about Christ’s love and acceptance, but at its core their religion for most of it’s existence would’ve stoned/hanged/castrated those I know and love who are LGBTQ+ or aren’t like them. Sure, they’re not the Westboro Baptist Church, nor do they strike me as anything like those villains, but their quite literal “holier than thou” demeanor has always rubbed me the wrong way. Just my opinion, but if your so called “one true” religion requires you to constantly recruit people to join it, maybe it ain’t the one true religion. 

And, in regards to the people saying that IV shouldn’t be only entitled to UCSB/CC students, I don’t entirely disagree. The backbone of the community is the working class Latino families that live in IV. That is entirely understandable and they deserve our respect and support. That being said, a bunch of Westmont or older than college age people living here is dumb. You contribute nothing to this community, you have no real reason to be here besides your proselytizing, and you take away valuable housing from those that need it.

Again no disrespect to any religion, worship what you want, but I find it futile and detrimental to our community. There are several churches/synagogues of various faiths and denominations in IV. We don’t need holier than though Christians taking over housing too. IMO",2,1725038395.0,t3_1f19gyu

1gqtdo9,lx14x4w,andrewgrhogg,"A few thoughts on this as an older person who has a dual engineering degree from the uk and an mba from CU Boulder, and has spent a lot of time in US classrooms from elementary to high school. 

1. The American education system is a joke. It is way too easy and there’s way too much emphasis on kids “mental health” and not failing, and giving xxx more chances. As an example I’d have tutored kids in math who have an A in IM4 but that don’t know their times table and on any given exam gets a C. But they have an A because exams are only 40% of the grade, and they can memorize shit and gets As on tests that are all multiple guess and only cover the 4 week module they just learned. And they get study guides that basically tell them what’s on the test! And every test/exam is multiple choice unless you’re doing an AP. 
2. Based on #1 above, kids become terrified, as the professor says, if they cant see the answer in the list. “OMG I might have the wrong answer!”  They get tied to MC tests, that never really actually test your knowledge, whether it’s Descartes or trig. They never learn to fail. 
3. They also get used to “I’m gonna get a second chance”. You don’t get second chances in the real world. And no you don’t need to “get an A” on everything in the work world. Most people give C-level work at best. But you’re not getting second chances if you don’t meet requirements and don’t get your shit done. College is the first place most of you are going to get the “this is it” model of tests and grades. No mommy writing letters. No crying in the teachers office. No “but, but, but…” excuses. 
4. MC tests are the lazy way to grade. They’re easy to write and quick and easy to grade.  But they show you nothing about the depth of the students knowledge. And they provide no means to separate an actual A student from a D student. Just look at grade inflation between the 80s and now in high school and college. Very few used to get As. Now something like 75% across all classes do at Yale of all places!! Those sorts of grades are t telling the student, the teacher, or the employer anything about anybody. MC test should basically be consigned to the garbage can. Note that I didn’t see a MC question on any test or exam until I got to MBA! That includes school through high school and my engineering degree. Getting over 70% on exams in the uk was an A and only about 10% of people got an A. If you got an A you were damned smart. 
5. UCSB is trying to up-regulate. They’re basically copying Berkeley - where most classes are graded on a curve and only a certain few will get As. And that’s the way it should be. If I’m an employer I know everyone at Berkeley got great grades in high school. I want to know which of the students with great grades are the truly smart ones. If you get As at Berkeley, then that’s you. At all other UCs - who knows. You’re all getting As.

Use a low grade as an opportunity to learn. What did you get wrong. What do you need to study. What can you do differently next time. That which does not kill you, makes you stronger. Differentiate yourself from your whiny peers by working harder and smarter next time to improve the outcome. Welcome to the real world!",-12,1731554595.0,t3_1gqtdo9
1gqtdo9,lx1bbnq,WeddingLucky4495,"See I would agree with you but people who take the Phys6ABC series are all biology majors who have had to take organic chemistry (regarded as one of the most difficult and most failed courses internationally), general chemistry, intro bio, and calculus (the most failed class in the world). Just because 1 class is an easy A doesn't mean everyone is being grade inflated (the average STEM GPA at this university is a 3.0) so idk why you're trying to tell me that we're all cry babies because 1 class in a 3 class series being easier means we're grade inflated.

First, the HVAC unit in the defaced classroom must have coincidentally been broken beforehand. Second, the protestors that broke in did not damage the HVAC unit. They may have defaced the classroom with the intention of creating a diorama of a war torn classroom but wanted to leave the HVAC unit intact. Third, UCSB custodial staff and UCPD discovered the HVAC unit broken, but not defaced, and conspired to blame the protestors for it to bring a more threatening figure to court.

OR

The protesters broke into a classroom with a functioning(maybe old) HVAC and destroyed it along with the rest of the classroom.

This ""the police are lying, the university is lying, the institutions are corrupt"" mindset is so dizzying to me. They literally documented themselves doing this.

I think there is a better conversation to be had with balancing privacy and necessity in the investigation, but the destruction of the classroom itself it just so wildly indefensible to me I can't fathom why people defend it.",4,1732510346.0,t1_lyuvqw9

Is this an honest question or do you just hope they didn't damage it? Because if you genuinely think a lax inspection and maintenance schedule could be confused with laypeople damaging the unit, then I'm not sure you are going to bring a lot to this discussion.

The Instagram warrant is the cops being lazy and tech illiterate so they're going for the easiest option which is get way too much information then sift through it.

3. Having a cause you believe in is not a free pass. You don't get to commit crime in Santa Barbara because of your stance on Israel Palestine. That's not how laws work.

Dispatch knows right away which button was pressed and even if there's no response from the button presser, cops are 100% sending someone over.

It's not preventative except maybe as a deterrent. Would this guy have tried to abduct someone next to an emergency phone? Maybe, but it seems less likely.",16,1714732839.0,t1_l2clj6b

Also it would have helped her deal with the mental anguish because if there was a blue phone she would have had that option or multiple options while she was being attacked, such that looking back she wouldn’t have to wonder as much about, what if no one was there.

You do realize that the UC brings multiple trucks out there every single day? And 100’s people walk around in it daily. That area used to be a military barracks/ outpost, and before that it was a tar mine it not as though this area is some unmolested bastion of ecological preservation.

If installing a few emergency call stations keeps even one person from being attacked, abducted, raped, or otherwise maimed, it is absolutely worth the investment of time energy and resources.

1d2x6u9,l64b8ye,BleakBluejay,"Initially it was kind of cool, because like, it was an acknowledgement of something that most people ignored or didn't know about or didn't want to know about. It was a little radical. But then there was not any follow-up. I think the intention was to make settlers more aware and uncomfortable about colonization and continued theft of land, thus opening up more dialogue about landback, but it ended up being a way to make academics and politicians feel better about settler colonialism without actually having to give anything up or change their ways of life. In a similar way to white liberals putting ""BLM"" in their twitter bio but then doing and saying absolutely nothing about antiblack racism, never calling it out, and continuing to support antiblack creators. They are acknowledging something fucked up or sad or unjust with a sad face and then moving on like they never said anything at all.

I definitely agree with the ""performative"" element, but not so much the ""offensive"" part. I think we should continue land acknowledgements, but I think it should actually mean something and be followed by *action*. If you are going to acknowledge we are on Chumash land, you should also acknowledge the illegally held Chumash remains in our basement, you should also acknowledge landback, you should also acknowledge any relevant fundraisers or charities or organizations or protests or local artists. For godsakes, even a cultural event like a powwow or beading circle or poetry reading, so at least it doesn't feel like they're talking about Indigenous people like we're all dead and gone.",11,1716950103.0,t3_1d2x6u9

Do you think there is value in reminding the white people in the audience, who may never hear it otherwise, that the land they live on was stolen from other people?",33,1716938288.0,t3_1d2x6u9
1d2x6u9,l641hg0,[deleted],"The issue to me is that virtually all land is stolen from other people. So such acknowledgements I find to be repetitive and obvious. Even within Native groups, there are countless examples of native groups warring with one another for territory. 
Much of the original colonial interaction with tribes was that of military alliances, tribe X engaging in trade agreements with colonial government Y in exchange for Y providing military support for X’s warfare with enemy tribe Z. 

So when any speech begins with a land acknowledgment, I find it trivial and nearly farcical. Anyone who went to school should already know that California was taken from Mexico who took it from Spain who took it from the Natives. 

Imagine if a public event in Istanbul opened with the following line: 
“Our organization honors and acknowledges that our event is taking place on the unceded territory of the Phoenician colony of Kadıköy, the people of whom undoubtedly called the land by a different name, who were in turn conquered by the Thracian or Illyrian people who named the city Byzantium. The city of Byzantium was in turn conquered by the Roman emperor Septimius Severus, who destroyed the city in a siege and rebuilt it afterwards (while also temporarily renaming it to Augusta Antonina). Many years later, after becoming the capital of the Roman (then Byzantine) empire (under the new name of Constantinople) Sultan Mehmed II “the conqueror” laid siege to the city for 53 days, after which he entered and conquered the city making it the capital of the Ottoman empire.” (So far, we are at 1453 CE, still 571 years to go, but you get my point).

Do you see what I mean? It just makes no sense to recount history at the beginning of every (usually non-history related) event. Land acknowledgments are just a repetition of historical record (a pretty brutally incomplete one at that). Why don’t we mention the Mexicans or the Spanish from which this land was also “conquered”? The “12 flags flying over california” exhibit on Stearns Wharf downtown does a better job at explaining the history of conquest of California than a 2 sentence land acknowledgment ever will. Though, the 12 flags exhibit notably lacks a chumash flag, presumably because the Chumash indians (like many tribes) did not have a flag while they controlled the land, and only adopted one relatively recently. Still, I think it would be nice to see it added to the exhibit.",25,1716946160.0,t1_l63i2np

1d2x6u9,l64baac,[deleted],"I agree with you, I don't think most non-native people ever think about Native history in their daily lives. But should they? Do the people of Istanbul regularly think about the siege of Constantinople or the various atrocities which occurred therein? Probably not. Why should they? I don't think about the history of every place I occupy or live in every day. Especially the brutal and dehumanizing parts, such as violent conquest. To do so would be distracting and exhausting, and pretty pointless. I find history to be interesting so I do at times learn/read/watch historical accounts, but I could not think about these things constantly or daily (and frankly, I don't think anyone could, at least without great detriment to their personal lives). I think there is undeniably value in being *aware* of these events, learning about them in school and the like, such that you are able to engage with the facts accurately if the topic ever comes up. But I don't think people should be expected to recall the history of land ownership of their present location in every waking moment, or every day. It just doesn't seem to be productive to do so.

I would even go further and conjecture that *most natives* probably don't think about Native history in their day to day lives. As an analogy, I am of a certain ethnicity. Do I think about the history of my ethnicity's losses of land or experiences of depravity and victimhood of hostility regularly? No. Am I aware of historical examples of these situations? Yes. I am knowledgable in the matter, but I do not burden my mind with thinking about it constantly. It's just not productive (unless, you are of the rare situation in which your entire profession is to think about such things, in which case, I could see why you would think about these things constantly).",10,1716950118.0,t1_l646oxu

We only had details on the grading criteria for the final assessment worth 50% of our grade, but the other assessments before it had no specific criteria. 


Ultimately, we received a course grade, but no specific grade on the 1st assignment, presentation and final assignment. The course grade is random too, I have an international student friend in the class who struggled the whole semester with the course content, struggled with their presentation, and ended up with an A (I somehow ended up with an A-, despite getting great verbal feedback in class on the assignments...he likely never read them). 


The prof is very nice and personable, but it's 2 days now that he hasn't responded to my request to view each of my assessment grades. Based on his awful preparation during classes and lack of willingness to provide us a rubric before the final assignment, I'm convinced he just randomly handed out those course grades.

These are one of the few times that I truly experience being at a loss of words - like, what do you even do once you start clearing crazy figures like 250k+? Why is it some incredible percentage? Even a 1% raise at 580k is rather substantial - with that salary, that's a healthy down deposit (or two) on a house in the area every year, even after tax/factoring typical expenses.

Normally I don't care what the rich make - its all a wacky system out of most of our control - but when you're a ""public"" figure like this and so many of your employees can't afford to live within 20 miles of campus - let alone without having a handful of roommates - it just seems so grossly wrong. Employees aside, the school is grossly overcrowding students to the extent that we made global news because of how much of a prison those Munger hall concepts looked, and ""affordable housing"" is a topic posted at least three times a week. It's no longer about being an institution to educate people, its about how many more students can you cram in and crap out at the end of the pipe.

1fvi94g,lq8507r,Halbarad1104,"Agree on staff not being able to live near campus... gives UCSB a weird abandoned feeling IMO.  At least where I was an undergrad, staff and faculty lived close enough to attend many events on campus.. concerts, plays, evening lectures, etc... UCSB feels commuterish and abandoned in some ways.

UCSB has planned to build staff housing... along Ocean Road near IV... but somehow that stalled.  It should not have stalled... and really, needs support.

But on the other hand, do you really want to live in housing that is operated by your employer?  As a last resort but also not optimum.

In 2001 Santa Barbara County started a big planning effort for Isla Vista... Isla Vista had just been excluded from the new City of Goleta by a County agency.  So Santa Barbara County was going to try to do some city-like planning for IV.

Now I, like many people, kinda like the old-school, laid back, 1960's backwater feel of IV, particularly during the summer.  If it stayed like that forever, I'd not be unhappy.

But, given that it is pretty densely built already, rebuilding many of the IV apartments to... more modern, more safe in an earthquake or fire, etc. also makes sense.  The proposed Munger dorm, not great in the safety dept, woulda been for sure safer than many existing IV buildings.

Staff available to rent/buy from replacement building in IV also could make sense... ecologically, it would be the best by a lot... a walk-in commute.

The 2001 plan was supposed to do stuff like that.  You pick a block or two and start going... The County got a long way and then the Coastal Commission killed it and then the County abandoned the IV Community Plan.  Along with many others I spent 100's of hours in the meetings, all just kind of thrown down the drain by the County.

Lots of places in the world, Paris most famously, have various laws and subsidies that favor certain occupants of housing, to keep Paris more diverse.  Paris could easily be exclusively the ultra rich.... in IV, many (not all of course) students have a lot of money and economically push others out... would have to work some solution that prevented that in IV.

Actually, there are a number of County subsidized buildings in IV already, and even some housing for otherwise unhoused.  For sure a plan could (and was in the 2001 planning effort) be worked out for UCSB staff.  Everything is so fractious and uncooperative these days it can feel impossible, but we could do it.",12,1728001457.0,t3_1fvi94g

I'm guess 800k is roughly 10:1 ratio of Yang pay to median UCSB employee pay. That's honestly just not bad. Many public traded companies this ratio is more like 500:1 or 1000:1 (link at bottom). 

Do we have equitable pay in this country and do I support that crazy private CEO compensation? Absolutely not. Do we want competent chancellors and want to incentivize our best minds into jobs in the public sector? Yes.

UCSB Chancellor pay is low compared to similarly ranked public institutions. If you want to make competitive hires you need competitive pay.

Tl;dr - I'm not going to freak out at Yang making the same as a 10-year do-nothing middle manager at FAANG. We got bigger societal fish to fry.

Yes it negatively characterizes cc students, but I don’t think it’s “because” they are cc students. 

The most common reasons for going to CC are: to be local, to save money, to work hard and gain easier admission from schools you didn’t get into. Totally legitimate. 

People moving to SB to live in IV and go to SBCC “usually” aren’t doing these things, and have other priorities and reasons for doing so (not saying that the choice is inherently bad, but it has nothing to do with being a CC student).

SBCC students living in IV are usually going out of their way to choose to live there.  UCSB students usually do it out of convenience/necessity. Again, lots of reasons to make that choice, but partying is the obvious one. 

Plenty of UCSB students have the same priorities. It’s just less easy to identify from external choices.

3. Social causes don’t suddenly become incoherent by expressing solidarity with other issues. Does it become harder to articulate demands/motivations? Yeah. Is everyone media trained? No. Is it possible that labor movements’ demands and goals can fail to be reduced to three word chants and slogans on banners? (hopefully this one is obvious). Maybe if you listened to some of your “colleagues” you’d gain some semblance of understanding of these dynamics; your comment clearly demonstrates that you have none. Note, it’s not even that you disagree with the political frameworks that I’m saying bind this protest together; in that case, you would still understand why the protesters are talking about what they’re talking about, and why, at least to them, this makes sense.

1. PERB has not found the strike legal, they just denied (without prejudice) injunction.

PERB will not decide the strike's legality for some time.
2. I agree that headline itself is not a smoking gun, but the demands themselves make it difficult to support the strike to the extent they are equated with the strike demands. Notably the Union in its PERB filings has sort of gaslights against the idea that the strike demanded divestment, even though it was the signature part of their ""demands,"" and very much part of their publicity leading up to the SAV.

I hope it’s not morally difficult to agree with the protesters. If calling for divestment while on protest is illegal, that’s just another awful anti union law in my eyes. Protesters should be able to say and “demand” whatever they want outside of the bargaining table: that’s free speech.

I don’t see how this is problematic at all for either party (esp the right one). Regardless of “sentiment” of the protesters, once the bargaining teams reach an agreement, the protests stop.

They can do some of it better. Especially now with the new QR code and video system they should be able to display majors. They also (understandably?) freaked out about security this year which might be why handshakes went away, and why they went to the two stage system. 

It's probably always going to be in the sun though. Maybe they should have attendants walking around with ice water to hand out?  But I don't think there's any way to set up temporary shade structures for thousands of people without also blocking a lot of the views of the ceremony and the setting.

I saw your previous comment: “You are acting like students haven’t been graduating outside in robes in June for the last 50+ years.” 

Sunshine is whatever, it sucked. But do you really think water is that crazy of an ask? 

Or to my other original point of not even having our degree displayed on the screen along with our name. 

Furthermore, I graduated with highest honors in my stem major and refused to buy the fourragere cord. Made me sad. But you’d also think that for the meager top 2.5% (or whatever) the university could actually afford to honor the students by giving them the cord for special recognition. Instead the ask for ANOTHER $50.

Agree with instapot (though careful; I believe some were recalled). Very easy to set and forget at beginning of day. And beyond just crockpot style stews, there are a lot of recipes where you are actually cooking within the pot

1ch79wo,l20ntl8,Silent_Gift3874,"Such a helpful write up! 1 thing to add on the “parties”. Since Greek life is relatively small at UCSB, the “parties” seem to be most commonly associated with Greek life freshman year (because everyone is living in a dorm and doesn’t have their own place yet). 2nd year on, the overwhelming majority of students are living in Isla Vista in apartments/houses and lots of hang-outs happen at your friends places in town. Sure there are some bigger parties too on Del Playa, but it’s a lot of just hanging out with friends at their apartments/houses. Just wanted to mention in case someone felt like they needed to be part of the Greek system to be social. I think it’s pretty cool how social the school is without having to be part of the Greek system (though it’s available for those wishing to partake).",63,1714520906.0,t3_1ch79wo

For example, I would spend the night chatting and drinking away with my friends in Joaquin and I loved walking the 10 mins or so home to Ynez after. Something about the cool night breeze at 2am while I'm buzzed up feeling all fuzzy, some of my favorite times.",3,1714547727.0,t1_l20ntl8

Trying to remember off the top of my head, the spots marked are: 

* The Davidson Library 8th floor bathroom 
* The arts building bathroom 
* The interactive learning pavilion 4th floor bathroom (may have been removed for lack of activity)

I also see that you’re trying to make the argument that anti-zionist policies leads to anti-semitism. The government of Poland was reactionary to the Israeli founding, as it was a Zionist project propagated by Western Europe to gain more control of the region of the Middle East (which is why America is so hellbent on protecting Israel right now). Poland was absolutely anti-semitic and used the guise of anti-zionism to prosecute Jews.

When you continue to conflate Judaism with Zionism though, this is going to happen. The founding of Israel was a multi-decade project led by anglo Europeans… and used “Jewish self-determination” and the atrocity of the Holocaust to make a land grab from Palestinians, who were JEWISH, CHRISTIAN, and MUSLIM. When we conflate this Zionism with “Jewish self-determination”, it makes it seem like it is a JEWISH necessity to opponents of Judaism, when it isn’t; it is a ZIONIST necessity.

1fjmu4u,lnp7vfx,AeroArchonite_,"I've been meaning to post this for a while; initally it was just going to be the Fall 2023 data -- I made the spreadsheet to calculate which meal plan was the most cost-efficient and thought you guys would appreciate it, but I never got around to posting it last year. I checked the [UCSB Dining website](https://dining.ucsb.edu/off-campus-meal-plans) again to ensure the data was current, and I noticed they had raised the prices since 2023. I cannot find any notice that the prices were changed (please let me know if there was), which strikes me as a bit untransparent. Also, I'm by no means a data scientist, so my apologies if I've made any mistakes -- DM me and I can send you a copy of the Google Sheet to check my work.

Without further ado, some take-aways from the general data for Fall 2024:

* There's barely any discount in the meal plan until you hit 10 meals a week, and even then it's by about 60 cents per meal. In other words, **the 7-meal plan is no more efficient than the 5-meal plan. Don't buy it to save money.**
* Since the walk-in price (IIRC) is $14/meal, **if you eat any less than 5 meals a week you're better off just walking into the dining hall for all of your meals.**

On that note: if you, for example, want 6 meals a week and are wondering whether it's best to buy a 5-meal plan and walk in ($14) for the 6th, or to buy the 7th and waste it, follow this chart (calculations omitted for space):

* 4 meals or less: Walk in only
* (5-meal plan)
* 6 meals: Buy the 5-meal plan and walk in
* (7-meal plan)
* 8 or 9 meals: Buy the 7-meal plan and walk in
* (10-meal plan)
* 11 or 12 meals: Buy the 10-meal plan and walk in
* 13 meals: Buy the 14-meal plan and waste one
* (14-meal plan)
* 15 meals: Buy the 14-meal plan and walk in
* 16 meals: Buy the 17-meal plan and waste one
* (17-meal plan)

As you can see, unless you want exactly 13 or 16 meals, you should be buying the next-lowest plan and paying the $14 walk-in price for the rest of your meals. Worded more dramatically, **you should eat every single meal you pay for.** Anyways, back to the regular anaylsis:

* Other than the drop around Week 3/4 (see below), prices don't really change within a plan week-by-week -- **buying a plan later in the quarter isn't any more cost-efficient.**
* The weird drop in prices around Week 3 (or Week 4, in 2023) is because of Thanksgiving, presumably because they expect people to waste their meals during the break.
* None of these price-per-meal figures are visible on UCSB Dining's website, and you have to make a spreadsheet to see them. They appear to have put a lot of data and analysis into this (e.g. the Thanksgiving price cut). This is just my personal opinion, but profit-optimizing something ostensibly meant to feed students (i.e. not squeeze money out of them) seems predatory. We're a public university, not a for-profit degree mill, and UCSB Dining's mission and pricing should reflect that.

And a few take-aways from the percentage comparison data:

* According to [the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm), the 12-month inflation rate is 2.5% (i.e. from Aug. 2023 to Aug. 2024). The average percent change in meal plan pricing is 3.46%, so **the price increase has outpaced inflation by about 1%.**
* Keep in mind the +20% and -12% price changes in Week 3 and 4 are due to the Thanksgiving cut moving one week later.
* The only notable change is that the 10-meal plan is now a slightly worse deal than it was last year, with the prices increasing slightly more than typical in the last two weeks of classes. I have no idea why UCSB Dining decided to do this -- if anyone has any guesses I'm very interested.

Hopefully this is both useful and helpful to you in deciding which meal plan to buy. Keep in mind all of this data is for off-campus, not for students in the dorms.

It is not necessarily easier and cheaper to cook at home in this case when factoring in time needed for school and work — time you only have now to do all the unique things university has to offer. I cook all the time post college, but while in school I never did to maximize my time doing other things that are time restricted. The opportunity cost of not having a meal plan is large.

Next year when you FASFA, you'll want to make ""Change of circumstance"" adjustments. There are good online guides for this. That doesn't really help you for the 2024-2025 school year though. As far as I know, those aid amounts are fixed at this point (I was a senor, so didn't have another year of school to give direct advice).

That said you should contact the UCSB specific financial crisis response team (if needed) [https://basicneeds.ucsb.edu/about/committees/financial-crisis-response-team](https://basicneeds.ucsb.edu/about/committees/financial-crisis-response-team)

Very unlikely your aid would go down. FASFA is mostly income, not asset based.

Unrelated: I'm 35 now. My single mom had virtually no assets, but she did have a reasonable life insurance policy ($200k). I don't know your exact situation, but I had an uncle that very smartly had me invest 100% of the money in low risk funds instead of grief buying a car or something stupid. It meant a little less ""fun money"" in my 20s, but that money is now approaching $1Million.

1g18jzd,lrgljt3,dlokshtanov,"Prof here. I get a lot of emails from students looking to do undergraduate research. 

The very first thing I’m looking for is whether the student actually wants to do research, or whether this is a strategic move because they want to eventually go to grad school «because grad school is cool» or their parents want them to, or whatever. Someone who is optimizing their future simply won’t have the motivation it takes to fight for months or years against a problem, when the likely outcome is that there won’t be any progress whatsoever. To do well at research you have to love the process for its own sake.

With that in mind - research in different fields is *extremely* different. So if you think you both want to do research in algorithms and in architecture, chances are you actually want neither [there are counterexamples to this, but those are *rare*]. Given the number of students who contact me I only take it further with students who are able to demonstrate genuine enthusiasm about my research field. 

So if you have contacted 10 different labs, chances are neither one of them saw that that particular field looks to be your passion.

Disclaimer - this holds for me, and *anecdotally*, for a fair share of profs in CS. Might not apply to your department at all.",39,1728675619.0,t3_1g18jzd
1g18jzd,lrfcabt,piggychuu,"CCS Bio alum. It is **rough** getting into labs here, and part of the reason is 1) there's a TON of students in every year fighting over a literal handful of spots, 2) many of those students may be relatively well connected to the prof, either via courses, CCS, or a teacher/prof that recommended said student over to said prof, and 3) profs get blasted by sooo many emails. It is really hard to stand out from the crowd when you're just another block of text on the screen. 

If you can, really try to see if you can meet in person either at office hours or whatever. I was in a similar situation and actually managed to get my PI's attention by leaving a handwritten letter at their office. Quirky, but it worked, and it turns out she was also a pen-nerd like me, so...

When I was looking into grad school at UCSB, I had a few referrals from professors that I was close with to specific professors that I was interested in being in their lab. If there is a class that you are excelling in and close with the professor, it may be worth seeing what that could lead to. I had a TA that was amazing and I told him about my interest in research as a first year, and he was also able to forward that interest to his PI.",13,1728660798.0,t3_1g18jzd

They only got back to me via a phone call last month, about 10 months after I filed the complaint, but I’m glad I did it. It will at least go on his record I hope.

1gku31o,lwf4zba,atmaprema,"1. The international community may see Trump as a charlatan or a buffoon or a disgrace, but they also know that under his years in office, there was less global conflict, not more. While you may be crying about Harris losing, or thinking that you need to take time away from school to mourn your feelings, Russians and Ukrainians may be quite relieved in anticipation of an expedited end to the senseless killings of their children, brothers and family. Likewise, Trump's tendency toward deal making (even if it's to massage his own image) will likely also expedite an end to the conflict in the Middle East. Under the Biden and Harris's watch, we left Afghanistan in tatters (if you are a woman, think of the plight of the Afghani women who were left not only under the rule of a Taliban freed by the current administration, but one now armed with billions in American weaponry). Talk to any serviceman or woman, and they'll tell you that it was a disgrace how we pulled out before the job was done. 

2. If you are young and lucky enough to have support for your bills from your family, perhaps you haven't noticed: inflation is a problem. Like, a huge problem. People were better off economically under Trump. They were willing to overlook flaws (even fatal ones) in his character in order to have a better shot at paying for food and rent for their families. If you live on the Left Coasts and work in tech, you may not have felt the sting of the last four years' policies on microeconomics, but if you live in middle America and barely get by, it has been crushing. Harris offered no concrete plan to alleviate this problem, nor did she recognize its severity. When asked on The View what she regretted about the last four years as politician in the Biden administration, her answer was a shocking: ""Nothing!"". Imagine voting for a candidate completely tone deaf to your struggles. You cannot blame people for not wanting to reward this attitude.

3. Going back to Harris's comment that she would change ""nothing"" about the last four years of policy. Under her watch, illegal immigration increased by 400%. This happened directly under her watch as the so-called Border Czar. Imagine you are a border town, or a border state and you see an enormous amount of illegal immigrants coming in. When you realize that it cost the state of New York $700 MILLION dollars to house and manage these immigrants last year alone, you'll get some idea of the cost burden being placed on governments around the country to do the same. This is happening at the same time that we're seeing record high levels of homelessness, displacement, inflation, economic struggles, budget problems on the local levels, etc. How on earth is this not a problem? Trump received his own record high proportion of the Latino vote because in good part because those illegal immigrants are directly competing with jobs that they are doing. They might have come over legally, and if they did, they sure as heck are staunchly anti-illegal immigration (as anyone in any country should be and is legally expected to be). These people sacrificed everything to follow the rules. Talk to any legal immigrant and ask their opinion about illegal immigration. Odds are, they'll echo these sentiments.

4. Harris as 'expected victor'. She was never elected, she was selected. Biden had made it a priority in his campaign to hire a woman, and a person of color (two points that she relied far too heavily on in her election, and the media's coverage of it, rather than a track record of success). If track record were the priority in 2020, Biden would have selected Elizabeth Warren. We should also note here that the Democratic party had a viable candidate in Bernie Sanders at the time that had swept multiple states and was well on his way to being the clear favorite to win the nomination, but the Democratic party and it's corporate sponsors decided that Sanders wasn't pro-business enough and they had to derail his campaign (which they did, sadly). Anyway, back to Harris. When Biden dropped out earlier this year, Harris was again appointed his heir, not elected. Losing a presidential election when you haven't won a primary yet (to gauge viability and support of that candidate) shouldn't come as a huge surprise.

5. ""Vote against Trump"" instead of ""why you should vote for me"". This was the platform that Harris ran on, which makes sense because a. it worked with Biden, and b. she did not have a clear, convincing answer to how she planned to make the changes she claimed she wanted a reality. 

6. Harris's 60 minutes interview was a disaster. She struggled to present cogent arguments about policy, failed to explain her failure on border control, talked around difficult topics and rambled. The American people were not given the image of someone competent and presidential. 

7. Covid policy and abortion. Harris required that all of her staff members, no matter what, must all be fully vaccinated, with all Covid shots and boosters. On the other hand, she claims that she is pro-choice. ""My body, my choice"" only applies selectively, it seems, which is a troubling contradiction.

8. Harris switched numerous key tenets of her philosophy and positions in the weeks leading up the election. She flip-flopped on fracking (shocking to many Dems who are pro-environment). In 2019 she said that she'd see oil company execs prosecuted for their role in climate change, but she suddenly cozied up to them for votes. She flip-flopped on calls for a border wall (odd that this wasn't a priority during her run as VP). Other major shifts in policy advocation were on Medicare for all and the Electric Vehicle Mandate. Such sudden shifts show a candidate who lacks authenticity. 

As someone who has always considered myself a liberal/leftest, it has been surreal to see myself inch toward the center, or, more accurately, watch the goal posts of extremism push past me, leaving me in the middle. What is worrisome is that nobody talks to each other anymore. Nobody asks anyone WHY they believe what they do. They judge them for it, they silence them, they avoid them, they cancel them. If you want to win an election, you need to understand the voters. Find out what their needs and wants are. The democrats have expected to win elections based on a smug sense of moral superiority, without bending at all to meet the real needs of real people. As the problems domestically have reached critical levels, the presidential candidate says they regret NOTHING about their last four years. Being honest about failings is critical, if you want to win.",1,1731251546.0,t3_1gku31o

As obnoxious as it might seem, faculty also aren’t required to upload grades at any time throughout the quarter. There aren’t any rules or regulations about how quickly or not they are required to grade anything, either. The handbook just indicates in a reasonable/timely manner, with no qualification for what that means. If a TA is involved, that might delay things even more, because TAs aren’t required to do labor for a class beyond their contractual start and end date. While many do, out of kindness, it’s not required. Basically, if a faculty member wanted to respect their own time and stick to their contracts, they could rightfully follow up with you in September. They could submit a grade change form at that time. Alternatively, they could very reasonably require you to meet with them about your grade, and if that’s the case it would be all the more reasonable for them to wait until when they are contracted to work instead of doing it as volunteer labor. Errors occur. I don’t know if it’s particularly helpful to assume that your professor was being arbitrary and capricious in grading or, worse, negligent by not responding to you in whatever you—or any student—considers a timely fashion, especially during a period when they aren’t being paid. Does that sound harsh? Probably. Can this be resolved? Yes. Does this sound like it at all needs to be escalated, given the timing (particularly since grades were due in less than ONE WEEK ago)? Absolutely not. I understand you might be anxious and frustrated, but the sense of urgency and lack of grace for your professor, who is also just a human, seems a bit unwarranted.",2,1719073961.0,t3_1dkuxiy
1dkuxiy,l9v601e,Unusual_Problem5369,"If it was the professor’s mistake, i think the professor should be accountable.

1dkuxiy,l9w621n,Embarrassed_Sea_4870,"I’m not sure what you mean by accountable here. It’s been one week since grades were due, following a TA strike where faculty have gotten contradictory messages about who has to take up struck labor following in the event that TAs don’t complete all the labor by the end of the quarter. There haven’t been any real resources allocated to make up that difference. Instead, it’s just been on faculty. To then suggest that faculty should extend themselves when they ARE NOT GETTING PAID is just really wild. Most working adults don’t get summer? Great. What does that have to do with being expected to do work when you’re not getting paid to do so? I certainly hope the implication isn’t to normalize doing work you’re not paid to do, because what does that mean about the workforce conditions and expectations we are creating for our students once they graduate? As it stands, there isn’t an adverse impact on the student, besides their own anxiousness, so—again—accountable for what? The irony about students is they will expect faculty to bend over backwards (what is called ‘grace’) to accommodate them when they are sick, having a bad day, turn in late work for any number of reasons, experiencing some kind of trauma, etc., but then give zero of that grace to their professors, who are NOT primarily teachers.",3,1719144843.0,t1_l9v601e
1dkuxiy,lak2f8a,Ok-Astronaut2495,"I understand your point but I was not just upset because my professor did not upload my grades lol. It is more about the lack of guidance throughout the entire course. We got no feedback for a single assignment this quarter in a small (&lt;20 people) class even though it was outlined in the syllabus that we would receive feedback early on in the quarter in order to help us improve our work. Grades ended up being uploaded at the very last minute before the grade deadline with no sort of rubric or feedback regarding how we ended up with a certain grade, on top of that with mistakes too. I am also graduating and needed the grade for grad school, and I'm stuck with a wrong grade because the grade change form could not be processed in time. I would not say that it is just an issue with my own anxiousness, but a lack of support from faculty during the time period when they are getting paid (literally during the school year). If you had to argue that faculty isn't obligated to give feedback throughout the year then idk what to say because isn't it literally their job to teach",1,1719511446.0,t1_l9w621n
1dkuxiy,lakakqx,Embarrassed_Sea_4870,"I can definitely understand the frustration, just to be clear. I also know with certainty that a lack of grade on a transcript isn’t sufficient enough to impact a grad school application (I didn’t have grades for 3 classes the first time I got into grad school or for 2 classes the second time. I’m finishing my second PhD, and I’ve written several letters for students in your position—all got in)! I’m not including that information to minimize your experience rather to just add some reassurance. If you’re worried, you can always email the director of graduate studies in the departments to which you are applying, though—or deans of admissions, depending on the programs. As far as feedback goes, when you say “that’s literally their job,” I’m sadly just going to explain it’s not. It might be your expectation, but that doesn’t make it their job. Feedback can look many ways. Even if a professor simply makes a general statement about how students are doing, that’s feedback. Nothing in the faculty handbook even requires or mandates feedback. It’s just suggested. Rubrics are absolutely NOT required; there are actually pedagogical debates about the efficacy of rubrics. No professor is required to give a rubric, to upload grades into any system expected Egrades, use Blackboard, or a lot of the practices to which any student has become accustomed. Again, is that frustrating? Sure. But technically that just means a faculty would be doing the contractually required minimum of their job.",1,1719514071.0,t1_lak2f8a
1dkuxiy,lalwl15,Ok-Astronaut2495,"well if the professor didn’t want to offer feedback or grade assignments throughout the quarter, then simply don’t say that you will in your syllabus. isn’t that also hypocritical according to your logic, when students are expected to show up to class and follow the syllabus when the professor can’t even follow their own words?",1,1719534180.0,t1_lakakqx
1dkuxiy,lalz6l8,Embarrassed_Sea_4870,"It’s not MY logic. I’m just trying to explain to you the responsibilities of faculty, which differ from student expectations. Hypocritical? No. I’ve never been in a class or taught a class wherein zero students strayed from the syllabus.  In the overwhelming majority of those instances, the student was not punished. Examples: professors accepting late assignments when the syllabus clearly states otherwise; professors rounding up even when they say they won’t or when the syllabus clearly states that X percentages points equals Y grades; professors rescheduling due dates/deadlines to be more flexible to student needs; professors dropping assignments/grades to help student grades; and the list continues. Students are constantly asking faculty to modify and adjust classroom expectations, which de facto modifies and adjusts the syllabus, when it is to the students’ benefit. When a faculty member has to adjust for their own benefit or makes a mistake that isn’t rectified based on the student’s sense of urgency rather than the terms laid out by their employer…complain to the department chair? THAT’s the hypocritical part, if anything. The other major difference, of course, is that faculty are employees with legal contracts and expectations laid out in those contracts.

I still remember the look on his face when I told him I'd rather  switch schools than switch majors. Haha.

Once approved, you'd be able to advance to the full major upon clearing all the other pre-reqs, even with one P on your pre-major record.

When you create this boogeyman of ""the enemy"" in your mind, it's easy to paint the worst possible picture of whoever you think is slighting you. They're all bad, all the time. And it gets to the point where you start lashing out at ANYONE who's not completely on your side.

You don't know this person's stance on the ""war"". All you know is that they were upset to be waken up at 5am, and you saw that as a license to make personal attacks. Being open here, I detest the genocide in Palestine. It's among the most important issues informing my vote this December. But I can completely understand how tribalism leading to inslults against your fellow common man can be a complete turnoff to people who would otherwise have been interested in learning about and supporting the cause.

you should be smart enough to extrapolate from the remaining 45% of students that do pay tuition, a majority receive financial aid either from private, state, or federal loans or grants. antagonizing innocent bystanders that have zero power to stop an overseas conflict (i.e barely-turned adults attending UCSB) will only result in more resistance and resentment towards your cause.

For example, it can interpret prompts in a different way than what has been learned in the class leading to something that is technically right but wrong in the context of the class. This requires the student to actually know the class to correct it. I think even when the internet became popular the question of are students actually learning was also asked. I think if you can't fight it and it seems like it will be here to stay then it's worth trying to work with and incorporate it into learning. That's some of my opinion.",63,1731791532.0,t3_1gswjtj

The reality of the situation is that UCSB tolerated the encampment and attempted to make good faith negotiations    in which both parties failed to come to a resolution.Then, in response to increasing volatility from protestors and counter protestors UCSB decided to shut down the encampment which is well within their authority and rights. 


There is no moral dilemma, the protestors can leave whenever they want, if you could change any university policy just be sitting on a lawn until the university gives in you could pass any policy you wanted.

I think the entire situation is morally neutral, and if anyone attempts to sensationalize the event they are either not arguing in good faith, and/or unable to recognize their own biases.


I have no issue with the protestors protesting, and I see no moral issue in engaging in disruptive and illegal protests, but I have seen this bizarre argument a lot where people somehow believe that organizing a police responding to illegal actions is somehow morally and legally unfair because they agree with the issue being protected and are unable to rationally interpret the situation.",2,1718244611.0,t1_l8b3cfp

1cqkrqc,l3su7se,SOwED,"Something that isn't always that well known or explained is the difference between a teaching university and a research university.  UCSB is the latter.  The professors by and large are not there to teach, but to conduct research, and, importantly, that is what they are hired for.  Their teaching ability or interest is not really a big factor in hiring.

So that's why you'll get professors who seem like they don't care sometimes, because they may actually not care, and professors who seem like they care but just aren't good teachers, because they love the subject but just aren't skilled at teaching it.",15,1715569708.0,t3_1cqkrqc

Even CLAS tutors told us that it was unfair and that we could only try our best to memorize all of the slides but that everything comes out of left field. But that is NOT learning. Don’t even get me started on the grading for the class too with all of the retroactive changes to midterm grades (both up and down) AFTER they have been released. For EEMB 3 I find it really disheartening that even the midterm 1 isn’t posted for review. Instead of making it easy for us as students to reflect on what we can improve on, we are forced to take extra steps to seek out the exam when really it could be used as a study tool. It’s very obvious that Thomasson does not like or want to teach this class especially given that she complains about the badly created slides and then has trouble explaining them and any of the concepts written. As a lecturer, it is your job to be able to explain what is on the slides and not just say words.

So still, my rent off campus in my for profit apartment, paired with eating 19 meals a week at the dining halls, is $3500 cheaper than living in a bedroom in a triple at the dorms with 10 meals/week. Make it make sense",7,1725493722.0,t1_lljitwg
1f95hor,llju6jw,SuchCattle2750,"The 10 meal plan is definitely the worst. The incremental cost to 19 meals per week is like $3/meal.

In general, dorms you only pay for the academic year, while apartments are 12 month leases. So it's more like $9000 in apartment. Comparing to 19 meals a week that leaves 11,000 for food. It works out to like $16/meal.

Then you add in staffing which is generally higher for dorms than apartments.   
  
Its not insane. 

But live of campus if you want. It's not mandatory at UCSB.  

Doesn't change the fact it's a public university that would be underwater without $2B of taxpayer support a year.

No one is sitting at home living off the dividends UCSB is paying out to them.",4,1725494479.0,t1_lljs4wv
1f95hor,lljvstf,cfelton02,"In my calculations, you see that I was comparing the cost of eating 19 meals with the cost of living in the dorms with 10 meals. So, your point is moot, if I changed to 19 meal plan, it only further raises the difference in money, even if the incremental cost of adding a meal decreases. $3/meal for 9 meals a week is still going to be higher than comparing to 10 meals per week.

This doesn't mean anything. Yes, my apartment is 12 month leases. However, the university also offers summer housing. You have to extrapolate 9 months from my apartment lease, because I am only living 9 months in the dorm, unless I do summer housing (edit, EVEN IF I SAY 12 MONTHS FOR THE APARTMENT IT IS STILL CHEAPER)

Yes, there are staffing, which of course will be higher for the dorms. Is it $3500 per person per 9 months higher? No. And again, the $3500 is the absolute minimum, because again, my housing is for profit, the university's is not. I could hire cleaners for my apartment to vacuum and take out trash once a week, and it would not cost me even close to $3500, let alone my entire apartment $10500.

My for profit property management company still has to pay for things like a front desk, and management positions.

Yes, it is insane. If they are seriously not making a profit, it is because the people on top are terrible at their jobs.",1,1725495085.0,t1_llju6jw
1f95hor,lljwj19,SuchCattle2750,"You know property managers basically do a few hours a year of work right? You know those cleaners also clean the bathrooms and common areas right?

A living wage + overhead $3500/year works out to like 60 hours per year of work.....

Again, would love to know your hypothesis of where these profits are going? Shareholders? Private owners of UCSB?

Live off campus, I don't care. I'm sure you'll love your for-profit landlords of your slum.",2,1725495356.0,t1_lljvstf
1f95hor,lljxfth,cfelton02,"Moot point, even if they only do a few hours of work / year, they are still paid a full salary, so it has to be accounted for when talking about a for profit business.

Fine, I could hire a cleaner to also clean my bathroom and kitchen (which, if you extrapolate to every apartment having a private bathroom and kitchen, would be far, far more work on average than cleaning the bathrooms and common areas in the dorms), and it wouldn't cost my apartment $10500/year.

Again, my hypothesis is that whoever is on top, is terrible at their job, and is horribly mismanaging the funds that are received.

Edit: I would also consider funneling the money from housing into anywhere else in the university as profit.",1,1725495703.0,t1_lljwj19

&gt; So I didn’t get my high school graduation so my family made it a bigger deal than usual to have some extra family members come next week on Saturday. However, plans have changed literally minutes ago and now people are going to have tickets (up to 6).

&gt; I would like my whole family to be together. I didn’t think plans would change this soon, but we already have location and dinner reservations for 7-8. It would really be disappointing if everyone I had planned on coming couldn’t end up doing so; I thought I’d jump on here and ask if anyone is going to use all six of their tickets.

&gt; I can buy you a coffee or something if you’d be willing to do so, don’t know what a good incentive would be. Anyways, thank you for reading this and hopefully I can find some graduating seniors who aren’t going to utilize all six to potentially donate :)

1g5l9ye,lsc088k,lostburner,"Diplomatic is usually best when you’re forced to work with someone and aren’t seeing things the same way.  “Hi, I wanted to get your advice on how I can handle &lt;problem x&gt; in class. I usually try &lt;approach y&gt;, but I understand it doesn’t work well in your section because &lt;reasonable reason z&gt;. Is there a better way I can approach this?”

- pre-emptively acknowledge their motivations and concerns 
- come with humility and collaboration rather than defensiveness 
- work in your very reasonable obstacles and coping strategies

Odds are they’ll just give you permission to keep using your phone for translation once they’re on the same page as you.  But of course there are cruel or egotistical or racist people in the world who won’t be swayed by that kind of discussion.

Another angle: you haven’t given very concrete evidence here that they dislike you.
- the TA calls on you a lot even though you don’t usually know the answers
- the TA didn't want you on your phone while answering questions.

Consider whether you are reading too much into their tone of voice or other cues that don’t matter much. Can you improve your understanding and success in the class, and how? This is the actual question, right?

Can you ask more basic questions in session, even when you think other students would already know the answer?

Can you bring a notebook and take notes on paper? (Do you typically take no notes at all?)

Out of all the courses I’ve taken, I have not seen a professor or TA target students to answer. There is definitely a push to get students to participate, but I have never seen a professor or TA call on a student then yell at them without leaving room for rebuttal of an answer or non-answer. I have unfortunately seen unfair treatment towards international students for merely existing. That’s mainly why I shut down your response.

1da5r0c,l7mzsaa,dadcore81,When I was a PhD student I remember one other TA dating a former student. Don’t recall if things started while she was actively his student.

They’re no longer employed by UCSB.,3,1717824479.0,t3_1da5r0c
1da5r0c,l7p22ub,throwaway29850395494,"Going to be the odd one out. I teach a particularly large class, and I often find many of my students attractive. I have never flirted with any of them. In fact, I intentionally never accept one-on-one requests for help, even though I know a lot of other TAs do. 

You have to realize that TAs are people too, and we can't control who we're attracted to. But it's just like cheating. Even if there's some attraction, you have to be intentional and not act on it. 

But, I think the taboo around dating undergraduates that are not your students is wrong. Unlike a college student dating a high schooler, undergraduates aren't minors anymore and can make their own decisions. And the dating life for graduate students is pretty hard, especially if you're a younger graduate student. Many of your classmates are older than you and married. If you date another PhD student, it is really challenging because you often have to break up afterward since you pretty much go to whichever university job accepts you. And dating people downtown is pretty hard since you're a student. 

tldr: downvote me, but I think dating undergraduates is fine if there's no possibility that you teach them. I don't think flirting with students is acceptable behavior.",6,1717864905.0,t3_1da5r0c

Just kidding.

I know that students have real anxiety about going to a professors office hours.

I don't want to be dismissive; the anxiety is real.

But I do want to challenge you to ask: what bad outcome are you afraid of?  

Most professors in CS at UCSB (I hope it's ""all"") are extraordinarily receptive to student questions. 

You might worry that you'll ""look dumb"" or ""feel dumb"" for asking. Try to let go of that.  We know you are all incredibly smart.  *You literally wouldn't be at UCSB in a CS or CE course if you weren't very recently among the smartest, hardest working high school students applying to college* and *we all know that*.

Other rankings utilize SAT scores (for schools that have them), GPAs, class sizes, acceptance rates, research impact, etc. UCSB fares better with academics than it does with students becoming wealthier than their parents. UCSB slipped a little in the us news rankings last year when they made it less about things like class size too

1ffns9j,ln1dul4,knownikko,"UCM has the most diverse student body of any UC. From an academic perspective, it might be difficult to hear, but you’ll get a better undergraduate education there than any other campus in the system. 80% of UCM undergrads participate in research. Class sizes are small and faculty are accessible. A higher percentage of undergrads go on to attain a Ph.D than any other campus in the system except Berkeley. 

These are the outcomes WSJ is measuring. 

Now, there are lots of other factors to consider when deciding where to go to school. UCSB is obviously superior by many of those metrics. But if you want the best possible undergrad education and academic experience in the UC system? Merced is second to none.",6,1726287261.0,t1_lmwdgjl
1ffns9j,ln21jkz,worldsfastesturtle,"This is inaccurate in terms of diversity. UCLA is ranked as the most diverse UC by Niche. UC Davis was recently ranked #1 in the nation for diversity. UCB has the most diverse ethnic population of the UCs. UCM has one ethnicity representing over 50% of its students. It also isn’t as diverse in terms of international representation. I’d reckon that it’s not as diverse in terms of queerness either. UCM has the most minorities, but this is not the same thing as the most diversity. They objectively do not have the most variety out of the UCs and are seemingly ranked pretty low in terms of the UCs for this metric. 

This is also false in terms of class sizes. For classes with fewer than 20 people they have, UCI 56%, UCB 56%, UCSB 49%, UCB “nearly half”, UCSD 45%, UCD 36%, UCSC 28%, UCM 27.9%, and UCR 21.7%. They rank 8/9 for small classes and it’s not a close margin. I’m sure that faculty is accessible at all of these schools, so that really cannot be accounted for. 

It’s great that 80% do research, although not all majors are going to even offer undergraduate research nor should they. This is a representation of what is taught there and the school having a medical school and the like. This is similar to the PhDS. It’s a great thing reflective of what is being taught there. It’s a good school, especially in comparison to all national universities. It ranks low amongst the UCs in terms of diversity, class sizes, academics, acceptance rate, etc. though. It only fares better in extremely tailored rankings that aren’t balanced though",2,1726302339.0,t1_ln1dul4
1ffns9j,ln6s1u6,Green-Hellebore-11,"WSJ's rankings attempt to figure out how much graduates of a particular college make, relative to what they predict they would've made on average. It takes into account:

  
33% immediate post-graduation salary compared to average graduate salary, based on ""exam results of its students prior to attending the college and the cost of living in the state in which the college is based"" (the latter of which is constant for all UCs). Basically saying people with X exam results should earn Y on average after graduation; if a college can take people who don't score well and get them to make good money that's a boost, whereas one that takes genius is judged more harshly, since they would've done well  no matter where they went.

17% years to pay off net price, estimating the increase in salary via a different method from above. They used ""the difference between the median earnings of the school’s graduates and the median earnings of high-school graduates in the state where the college is located and across the U.S. in proportion to the ratio of students who are in-state versus out-of-state"" (presumably over a period of time rather than immediately) and using average cost after aid as the net price. Of course, this means more lower-income students -&gt; more aid -&gt; lower net price.

20% relative graduation rates, based on the expected rate of students who would graduate given exam scores and the percentage of students whose income is 110k+. If a college takes people who are not expected to do well in school, but graduates them anyway – or takes lower-middle income students who are more likely to drop out when times get tough – that's a boost.

Most UC schools admit students who would have excellent chances of graduating and would make good money no matter where they went. UC Merced (and to a lesser extent Riverside and Davis) admit a lot of students who are lower-income and at risk of dropping out. Many of these students come from working-class backgrounds – think the Central Valley, Inland Empire, areas with high concentrations of immigrants – where no one has attended college. The fact that these students are able to achieve reasonably successful outcomes is indeed a credit to the college. In contrast, UCLA, SD, SB, and Irvine are more populated with good test-takers and affluent students with strong support systems or what-have-you. People who would do all right no matter where they went. 

If you go to Merced you likely aren't the most academically inclined person and didn't get into any other UC schools, or you think Merced will be much easier than any other UC and plan to somehow graduate with a 4.33 GPA. For that type of person, Merced is an excellent school, in the sweet spot between the more competitive UCs and the generally not as well-ranked CSUs (some of which are, in my PERSONAL opinion, better than UCM/R/SC though).

I wouldn't myself agree with this methodology, as I think it cuts too far in the other direction, but attempting to compare results to a baseline that is different for every school is, in principle, a good idea.",3,1726367678.0,t1_lmw2eue

1ffns9j,ln2264c,hiketheworld2,"WSJ primary ranking is “how well each college sets students up for financial success” which is measured by “how much a school improves students chances of graduating and their future earnings.”

Where a school is ranked in any list depends on what they are ranking. Last year, US News and World Report (THE college rankings most people refer to), changed its system to include “social mobility” as a factor in its rankings. They used the number of Pell grant recipients as a proxy for social mobility. This meant large public schools with lots of Pell grant recipients ranked higher and private (more expensive), smaller (fewer possible grant recipients) moved down. 

This meant schools who want to preserve high rankings (and have the available student support funds to do so), react by admitting and funding more low income students to boost their rankings. Thus, those who decide the criteria upon which powerful rankings are based can use them to effectuate desired social policies.

Why do schools care about rankings? (1) Attracting applicants who rely heavily on rankings because they perceive it as associated with employment/income prospects, (2) attracting alumni and other contributions.

She decided to commute since it’s not that far, but she also didn’t want to do all that driving and wanted to minimize commute expenses. She decided to take the bus from downtown Ventura that goes directly to campus, for which they sold passes for $120/mo for unlimited rides. 

The hard thing was that she had to get up super early to catch the only bus that went to campus, go to her classes (sometimes only one), and then stay on campus until the first bus to Ventura left at 3 pm. She would be so tired that she would sleep on the couch in the non traditional student center every day. Some days she would get to campus only to learn that her one class was cancelled last minute— then she has to stay in campus all day for nothing. She would basically be gone all day from like 6 am to almost 5 pm just for one or two classes a day. The classes she needed were every day of the week so she did it every day.

1e2fre3,ld113k8,Funky_UnFelon,"UCSB is heavily weighted against the inconveniences of distance and traffic. It’s a 40 minute drive each way when there isn’t traffic. When you are picking your classes be mindful of the expected traffic times. There are plenty of  classes to choose from throughout the day; however, in the event that you have no choice but to pick a class time that would expose you to traffic, good news, the quarter system travels at the speed of light. Therefore, perhaps you will have the opportunity to avoid those inconvenient class times in the following quarter. 

Traffic can be learning time; go on YouTube (one of many options) and find videos about whatever you’re studying and listen (not watch). Or you can record yourself reading your relevant material, textbook perhaps, and listen to that too, thereby keeping concepts fresh.

There are a bunch of colleges mostly in the Midwest/east coast that run annual survivor seasons and film them/turn them into YouTube shows. They do both semester/quarter long and weekend games. I think the Maryland or Ohio one is the best iirc. 

There are also higher budget ones not affiliated with a campus, such as Survival challenge (https://www.instagram.com/survivalchallenge_?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==). I competed in this a couple years back and it was the real deal. I’m sure you could get a lot of tips from just perusing their pages/live feeds on fb. 

Some other things to keep in mind is asking contestants for their socials and checking their mutual friends to avoid premade alliances. That can be an issue and can result in a pagonging

Because if you're hired and you realize you need more time to study, you're gonna be a quitter and all the job finding, interviewing would be for nothing. So take some time to settle in, push yourself to see what your free time is and then apply for jobs.

1gcucmg,ltxu28j,Tre_Stuges,"This is the best advice here at the moment.

Part of me wants to see that the OP is on easy Street. But, another part of me wants to tell you to be cautious until you're confident, as Bluejay has suggested here.

Because back in my day (late '80s to early '90s) most of us that were early in our second year of Mechanical Engineering were usually taking six classes per week, holding down part-time employment (for some that meant something chill in IV, but for others might be working half time at a local tech company, large or small).

Then, on top of that, because we all knew it was important to show some extracurriculars on your paperwork, we also try to squeeze one or two of those into our schedules. I decided to pick two activities and stick with those for my entire time at the University, and I thought it would be wise to choose one ""serious"" activity and one for fun, making sure that both my pics would catch the eyes of future employers, etc. 

I ended up with: 

#1: Working at the Daily Nexus during its heyday (look up the Chancellor Robert Huttenback embezzlement scandal, the campus Facilities Management kickbacks scandal - these stories were much larger than just campus news, and we were scooping the Santa Barbara News Press (the local daily newspaper at the time, which eventually became a scandal itself, LOL) on a daily basis. I held a handful of editorial positions during my time at the paper, spending anywhere from a few hours a day at up to a dozen hours per day at the office. Bonus was receiving a small stipend for our efforts, usually something slightly under $200 every two weeks, IIRC. When all was said and done with my UCSB education, I would have to say that this was the most rewarding and useful education I received at the school.

#2: I competed on the UCSB Bong Team. Don't laugh - while we were never quite able to get officially sanctioned by UCSB (remember, this was long before cannabis was legalized locally), in 1988 we were recognized as the unofficial champions of the Southern California college/university circuit. UC Riverside was the only participant that ever gave us a real challenge.

And back in those days, we still had control of our Halloween and International Sorority Volleyball Tournament festivities. The local authorities were just beginning to experiment with shutting down all driving within Isla Vista and booting out anybody that didn't live in Isla Vista or wasn't a UCSB student during the partying. Apparently we won the battle, but not the war. 

Ridiculously busy as we were, we managed to get through it all, not to mention we continued to propel the reputation of UCSB ever higher in national rankings. You're welcome. :-)

Oh, the last stuff I should mention. Most of my original M.E. peers graduated with respectable grades, quickly transitioning to the next phase of their lives as they hooked up with future employers and future spouses.

Me? I bailed from the M.E. program by the end of my second year at UCSB. For a while I thought I might do a three-way liberal studies major, but then realized .I would just end up learning next to nothing in three different disciplines. So, I decided just to try a little bit of everything and see what blew up my skirt. Shortly after beginning my 7th year at UCSB, I still hadn't found my calling and decided I needed to take a damn break and figure out my life.

I worked some easy part-time jobs for a year or two, until I was recruited to serve as the IT director for a large and growing local non-profit, where I set up the first DSL-based network spanning the tri-counties, connecting six Branch offices plus a corporate office with a centralized computing system handling everything from accounting to program registration and sales. Did that job for about 10 years, then to semi-retired, cutting back on long hours to serve as a local ""Techno-Sherpa,"" something I'm  still doing to this very day.

The moral of my story? You're currently living some of the greatest years of your life right now, so be active and take advantage of anything you can be involved in. And if things turn out completely topsy-turvy upside down, don't worry about it too much. Having been accepted to attend UCSB, you're obviously smarter than the average bear. Play hard, work harder, and simply tried to do the best for yourself and those around you. Good luck!

PS. attend your o chem prof's office hours every week if they're in person.

1f7mlzb,ll8zstu,Roanie11720,"hello. I’m an incoming third year but as a freshman I was in the same boat. I was built like a twig and in high school I was made fun of for it. I started lifting at the start of my freshman year and I too was very intimidated since I was this super skinny guy in a room with all these buff guys. The key is consistency. I promise everyone’s only focused on themselves and even the biggest guys at the gym are also super insecure and have dysmorphia. 

Even now with a couple years of experience and having people compliment me all the time on my progress and being known as the buff guy now in my friend group, I worry more about my own physique than anyone else’s. Just stay consistent and focus on yourself and I promise the results will speak for themselves. 

Another thing that may help is realizing that most of the jacked people you see also started out fat or skinny. Everyone’s in the gym to make progress and no matter what you look like, it’s respectable that you’re in there to better yourself. 

My dms are always open if you need any advice. Good luck!",10,1725332522.0,t3_1f7mlzb
1f7mlzb,ll925t4,Single-Paper5594,"hey man, thanks for the reply! yeah, i dont tend to get too caught up in it since i, too, am mostly just focused on myself at the gym. plus most of those fit/buff people i end up interacting with are so nice anyway so i wasnt afraid of judgement or anything :-)

when class was in session my first year i was able to go pretty consistently throughout each quarter starting in late fall q, averaging about 5 times a week.

i will say that seeing stuff from people i know irl can get kinda discouraging tho. for example i saw this dude with HUGE arms who i knew as a loose friend who claimed to have done it in 6 months. after about over a year of consistent lifting, i was nowhere near that but definitely had some improvements. 

i guess i was just pointing out how strange it is i feel like there is a highly concentrated deal of Already quite fit people compared to newb/intermediates like me. but yea u seem super chill so ill hit u up!",4,1725333548.0,t1_ll8zstu

Everyone starts somewhere, and comparison is always the thief of joy, especially in the gym. All kinds of athletes from all kinds of sports are working out there at the same time, and they all had to be rookies at some point too. 

Don’t lose heart. It can be hard, especially with how visible the gym tends to make people feel, but at the end of the day the jacked people are having just as much anxiety as you.

1f7mlzb,llu755q,andrewgrhogg,"As a lifelong gym goer and general all round athlete (crit racing, mtn biking, 10ks, marathons, triathlons, etc) allow me to set a few things straight for you. 
1. The vast majority of people in the gym have no idea  what they are doing, do most of their lifts incorrectly, lift weights that are far too heavy, do far too many irrelevant and time wasting exercises, spend far too long in the gym and have horrific diets that limit their gains.  The ones that are jacked mostly have a genetic advantage and are doing one thing right. They’re consistent. And they’ve been going for multiple years. Despite their ineptitude they grow because they go. 
2. As a result of #1, do not go to the gym and copy other  people or get depressed about other peoples physiques or weights. With a little focus and consistency, and doing the right things, you can kick their asses in short order. 
3. As a beginner (and you and almost everyone in that gym is a beginner) you can focus on a few multi-joint lifts, done correctly and over time with 4 times per week, you can make good gains. 
4. If you do dumbbell bench press, seated row, pull up, dip, full squat (after working on flexibility), lunges, hip thrusts and deadlifts you will hit your whole body each week and create more than enough load to stimulate growth. You DO NOT need to do (and should not do) single joint exercises like bicep curls or tricep presses. Until you are jacked and want to work on any genetic deficiency’s or want to compete once a sport you want to excel at. 
5. Focus on intensity during lifting sessions, do no more  then 1 hour max, eat plenty of protein, eat enough carbs and fat, get good sleep, cut out sugar and alcohol and most processed food (chips, cookies, soda, etc) and you will see rapid gains. 
6. Do NOT load up your weights. Focus on technique and keep reps relatively slow, pausing at the “bottom” of every lift. The goal is not to lift the most weight. The goal is to put on muscle mass with the lowest risk of injury. 
7. 8-12 rep for 3 sets is an old standard and is there for a reason. It works. That rep range allows for 40 seconds or more of time under tension (2 concentric, 4 eccentric) which has been shown in many research papers to be the best for muscle hypertrophy. 3 sets is perfect for triggering enough muscle damage without having you in the gym for too long (much over 40 minutes) and creating too much of a cortisol reaction. Can you do other models that work? Sure, but 3x12 will get you in and out quickly and maximize gains over the long term without doing stupid shit like binding your muscles, doing partial reps, doing epic rep ranges, etc. 

Do this for a few months and you will see changes. But note that anyone that tells you they got huge arms or anything else in a few months is either a genetic freak (1 in 10,000) or is lying or is taking drugs. Ignore them and move on. 

Good luck!",2,1725648927.0,t3_1f7mlzb
