1cr6236,l3y20dm,CaptinHavoc,"As someone with a master‚Äôs degree in history with this general era as a specialty, there is a noteworthy difference between the Civil Rights protests and now.  Namely, they did more than *just* protest and did the boring work of movement planning.

Civil Rights protests did obstruct and cause disruption, but they also did a lot more nitty gritty, unglamorous work of meeting with legislators from across the political spectrum and power ladder and made deals, compromises, with very actionable goals.  They didn‚Äôt wait for an invite either, they offered to meet.  Rosa Parks, for example, met with lawyers so they would know to help her get out of jail after she refused to give up her seat (and yes it was planned).  During that bus boycott, legal experts and leading activists within the movement sat down and TALKED with people as the protests were going on.

Protests that only ‚Äúmake noise and raise awareness‚Äù without doing anything else end up backfiring pretty bad.  The general historical consensus on the Vietnam war protests, for example, is that the antiwar protests ended up prolonging the war and was one of the driving factors to the rise of the New Right.

With social media existing, movement building has changed fundamentally, causing movements to be largely decentralized which is good for making noise and voicing discontent, but absolutely ABYSMAL at focusing that discontent towards more concrete goals and engaging with people in power.

Contrary to your comment. Israel is not new, Israel has existed. Jews have existed here. Ashkenazi jews are linked by DNA to the land. Palestinians were offered their own state but declined multiple times leading to 1948 and also after. Peel commission deemed the land purchases legal.

However you also are glancing over when jews were allowed to return and freely practiced their religion, most notably when Spain outlawed Judaism and forcibly removed jews. Again, if you look at it comparatively, if you were a Jew in the 16th century, you would be much better off in Jerusalem rather than in most of Europe.

Your DNA claim is also a huge reach. I've got Norwegian DNA, does that mean I have an ancestral right to forcibly remove someone who isn't Norwegian from their home in Oslo so I can move in? Cause if I don't do it someone else will right? 16 million people are related to Genghis Khan, do they have a righteous claim to Mongolia? Hitler said the Aryan people had an ancestral right to all of Europe, was he right?

In regards to your last comment, (which comes off as extremely islamophobic) like I mentioned Jerusalem is a holy city for Christians, Jews, and Muslims. Of course there is going be to some overlap in holy sites. This doesn't mean in every case it's a deliberate attack on Judaism or Christianity (although I'm sure in some cases it was!)

This idea that Zionism is a new political ideology or a colonial concept is one such case. The entire essence of Judaism is inextricably tied to Zionism and the concept of returning to aboriginal lands. As you may know, pious Jews make sure to face in the direction of Jerusalem when they pray. 
Political Zionism isn‚Äôt settler colonialism it‚Äôs decolonization of land occupied and controlled by invaders and that, in order to be historically accurate, includes Arabs.

What about students who worked their asses off for 4 years, juggling online and in person classes, looking forward to a vibrant college experience, having to finish out their senior year while nursing a shattered arm from riot police that Block himself directed? I think graduating and continuing students have a right to feel angry at the institution that has both failed *and* nurtured them for the past 4 years. You‚Äôre implying that students should feel uniformly about their college experience, when I think it‚Äôs super reasonable to feel both proud of yourself at commencement and grossed out at the diploma you‚Äôre holding in your hands. And what‚Äôs more, as tuition payers, I think it‚Äôs even more reasonable that students would want to express that anger/ dissatisfaction/ betrayal at the university‚Äôs biggest annual event, which in their eyes, given the admin‚Äôs behavior, is making a mockery of what is supposed to be a celebration about THEM. 

What I think is weirder is statements by people uninvolved in the protests or who feel indifferent wanting to bury their heads in the sand and pretend like they‚Äôre not living through a historic moment, a phrase I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre sick of hearing since COVID, but no less true just because you‚Äôre sick of it and want it to go away.

1cr6236,l3zhdpg,GooglingAintResearch,"This past weekend, UCLA people (among others) tried to ruin a Commencement of a *totally different* college (Pomona). Only a handful of people from the actual college were there, the most people being unaffiliated students or randos who can't possibly have had any idea of the history of the college's conversations and relationship with the issue. The majority of Pomona College students who had been involved in earlier protests, indeed, decided they wanted Commencement and participated, showing their support of Palestinians during the ceremony in speeches and with their dress. Those students quickly turned critical of their peers trying to stop the graduation, so that ignorant outsiders had to be called in to do what hardly anyone in the college wanted.

So there is no way that the pro-Palestine cult types won't try to destroy the UCLA commencement, force LAPD to respond, and then say it's like the Rodney King beating etc etc. They will call in their gangsters from all around the region to do so. 

The goal is polarization and division. ""Divestment"" is just a smoke-screen to attract moderate followers who figure, ""Sure, divestment sounds great. Reasonable and simple. Of course I'm against funding war, it's a no-brainer, and anyone who 'disagrees' is obviously a jerk."" Because the vast vast majority of people are against war, but they're not against war *and* with the greater Islamist movement. They need to break off this set of anti-war people from normal anti-war people to join their movement and fight the other (normal) anti-war people who won't get on board with Islamic epistemology.

These innocent rubes are groomed to join their (non-unique) anti-war stance with people who seem to be their tribe, the Islamists. Their solidarity grows as they jointly provoke law enforcement and produce media images of police responding with apparently unjustified force. Most have no clue that the SJP/BDS plan has been going on for decades, that every couple years a motion is made in student governments for the seemingly innocent, non-brainer ""divestment"" plan, to catch (understandably) sympathetic new recruits. In this current cycle, they were especially fortunate to have a ready base of innocents repulsed by the war and desperate for a group identity feeling. 

They could have made the same pitch 2 years ago (as they always have) but would have only got a few recruits while others would have thought ""Hmm, sounds OK, but what do I know about Palestine-Israel? I'm not really into scarf-wearing and praying."" Whereas now you have all these new people who just woke up thinking it popped into their heads to be against the situation...and not questioning the fact that they have been steered to focus on Israel of all places.

The new recruits work as the rhetorical shields for allegations of anti-semitism. Because they, at least consciously, are not anti-semitic and can genuinely disavow anti-semitism. They will provide their own logical rationale of why their intentions are not anti-semitic. The orchestrators can point to these members and use their voices to argue the absurdity of calling the movement anti-semitic, while they still add strength in numbers to the underlying anti-semitic ends of the leaders.",9,1715685222.0,t3_1cr6236

You can‚Äôt act all big and tough ‚Äòdo what we say or else‚Äô and then also cry like a little bitch when the people come and interrupt or take away the protesters. 

IDGAF about Palestine or Israel, I got my own problems and bills and kids to deal with. But if someone like you ever said ‚Äòagree to my demands or else‚Äô, you can be damned sure my first step is violence, not capitulation

EDIT: I see the protestor ball suckers are in full force to downvote. Here‚Äôs the deal from my perspective - agree or disagree, that‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôm speaking honestly so take it for what it‚Äôs worth. 

As someone who is generally sympathetic to a good bit of causes; protestors over the last 5-10 years have taken my sympathy. 

You do not destroy artwork, slash tires and all these other things the climate protests have been doing

You do not block roadways. You may have a right to protest and I fully support that. US citizens however also have the right to travel and not be held hostage in traffic jams caused by people not allowing traffic to pass. 

Protest at congress, protest at administration offices, banks, etc. You know, the people who can make a difference. Bothering people that are just trying to get to work or school serves no purpose since these people are incapable of helping your cause and by alienating them, you‚Äôve lost support. 

I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt be disruptive in your protests, a non disruptive protest is ignored, my point is you are disrupting the wrong people. 

Lastly; to all of you ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs happening in Gaza is more important than your little celebration.‚Äô No it isn‚Äôt. Simple as that; it isn‚Äôt. We are American citizens and we have lives, problems of our own and accrued a MOUNTAIN of debt, blood sweat and tears to get to this moment. We are allowed to have our moment in the sun, it‚Äôs just a few hours on one day. It doesn‚Äôt take away from your protest, you‚Äôre disingenuous by making the comparison and I immediately ignore you when you compare the two by saying things like ‚Äòyour little celebration being disrupted is nothing compared to ‚Äòwhatever Gaza death here‚Äô. Sorry, this country does not care for the most part. The Middle East is ALWAYS at war. If we stopped celebrations because of all of the wars in the Middle East, there‚Äôd be no more celebrations. 

According to protestors, we are never, EVER, allowed to enjoy or celebrate anything for ourselves or family while this war in Gaza is going on because what‚Äôs happening in Gaza is ‚Äòmore important‚Äô 

Sorry; but many of us are simply trying to keep our country from electing Trump; we have plenty of our own issues and really just aren‚Äôt looking to take on any more. We cannot afford housing, wages suck, we have plenty of shit going on in our own life. Call us selfish, I don‚Äôt care, but we all need to keep paying bills and taking care of our kids and I‚Äôve yet to see a Palestinian protest that offers a living wage and retirement package so leave me the fuck alone so I can live my life.

As you could have just walked a few feet around, after all the encampment was on the lawn and cops were the ones occupying the buildings here.

Were you the one that tried to send a student into anaphylactic shock by planting bananas which you knew they were deathly allergic to?  Because that's what was done by people trying to come into the encampment who were not part of it.

&gt;I'm watching a live video of them cleaning up Dickson Plaza.

Yeah, because cops beat down and arrested the organizers and people in the encampment.  Look at the footage of before cops arrived, the encampment was organized, the lawn was clean, people were sitting on the clean grass singing and chanting. The vice chancellor can confirm.

&gt;But I'll remember all the destructive, hypocritical behavior of the people in the encampment,

Oh so you were invading the camp with bad intentions.

You realize it's the police who destroyed the camp right? I watched it on first responder and other livestreams all night.  

Talk about hypcritical and destructive.  But you and the cops, not the protesters for Palestine and against genocide.

Again you are ascribing the graffitti (while clutching pearls) to the protesters... who were not there when it appeared.  They had been dispersed and arrested.

Yes you are an instigator if you were to walk through a person's picnic on the lawn on public property, or try to enter their tent site.

&gt;Someone waved a banana in someone's direction. Oh, my Lord. I guess you're not pre-med.

The people who tried to send a student into anaphylactic shock with knowledge they had a fatal allergy didn't ""wave a banana"", they hid bananas inside the tentsite and threw these in.  

I guess you're no budding doctor either.

Just per usual, assigning property damage to peaceful protesters instead of the parties we watched live on feeds last night.

The protesters weren't there to do this, they had been taken in the busses already and dispersed.  We watched live as police destroyed everything and left it.

Hello (my name),

I'd ask you respectfully to address me using some variant of my name in emails.

We can't take attendance every day in a class of 120. The pop quizzes are a way of integrating random attendance checks (combined with a short quiz on the reading material). The quizzes allow students to miss one or two without significant penalty (it only takes 5 quizzes to reach the 10 maximum points). 

Take care,

If it were up to me, I wouldn‚Äôt care about the damn doctor‚Äôs notes. It‚Äôs my administration that holds the power in these situations, I have to abide by them whether I agree or not. And they make some of the stupidest decisions.

I‚Äôve never been so sick in my life until this year. But I watch parents drop off their sick children every day for the free babysitting and break. The trouble-makers always have perfect attendance and all the extracurriculars bc their parents don‚Äôt want to parent them, sadly.

Just a few short years ago it was straight up authoritarian how vigilant we were forced to be about social distancing and wearing a mask properly. My admin would email me during class asking if I was within 6 feet of a student for more than 15 mins and come down on students not masking properly. Like they forgot the students weren‚Äôt already just a few inches apart from eachother in class or at lunch. üôÑ

Well now it‚Äôs harping about attendance since many schools are now seeing chronic tardiness 60%+ of their student body. I suspect all of Admin‚Äôs BS from the years before has a bit to do with morale and attendance issues.

The year after all hell broke loose (2020-2021), the district restarted their big raffle (big ticket items: car, laptop, etc). The ONLY WAY students would qualify is if they had perfect attendance all the way up until senior year. So, sickness is bound to spread like wildfire.

1ferxh0,lmwq83o,BojackTrashMan,"You've got a few massive assumptions that aren't correct here. And in this you are demonizing all homeless people because of this guy. 

1. You are assuming this man is mentally ill. If you read the article, One person made the explicit point of saying that it is so much easier to assume there is something wrong with this guy mentally or that he is ill rather than believe the truth - that he just hates women and wanted to hurt one, his history backs that up. 

People like to classify extreme violence as being mental illness because we assume that somebody must be sick in some way to do something like that. But it's simply not the case. Some people are hateful and some people are violent. 



2. Your assertion that homeless people are given ""freedom"". If anything homeless people are kicked out from one place to the other and it's persistently made illegal to be homeless but obviously they have nowhere to go. They don't have freedom to just do whatever they have nothing &amp; there is nowhere safe for them. Homeless people are at a high risk for violence and especially homeless women deal with incredibly high rates of physical and sexual assault. You're acting like they just sort of run around doing whatever they want but I would argue that that's not a result of ""letting them free"" so much as it is ""refusing to do all the things we factually know help solve homelessness because we don't like that it gives homeless people things"" and watching that run wild.


3. When mentally ill people do end up on the streets, it's fucking tragic. Most mentally ill people are not violent. But even if someone is are we really saying that this is because they're given too much freedom? Not the fact that they aren't given any help? Institutions were heavily shut down about 40 years ago because of both America's lack of desire to pay for them and the rampant abuse taking place. But now we basically just cycle homeless people through the prison system and back on the streets because we have absolutely zero methods in place (in this incredibly wealthy country) to actually do something about the situation. 


There are lots of problems with homelessness in the US but you're phrasing this as if the problem is that we just allow homeless people to go around murdering others for funsies. Maybe part of the problem is that we don't actually have any proper systems to take care of mentally ill people and we don't give a fuck about the homeless.

A few months later I was buying groceries with my gf and realized there was no way to fit a bottle of whipping cream into the bag we brought, so after scanning everything I put it in my sweater pocket.

She never bothered my whasian girlfriend, even when we were scanning things together lol.

Profiling is when you deal with a certain type of person who looks a certain type of way. And you deal with hundreds of these people a day, and you begin to get an eye for what someone would look like, that would be doing something like stealing, and by presuming he's doing that. By the way, he looks, he's racially profiling, but to be racist would mean that he for no other reason, simply hates another race or dislikes or treats negatively diffrent another race an idk if that's the case here

Another way I would put it is if you took that same person and put him in another environment and off the job. So he's not working if he still said the same thing, then yeah, it's racist. But if he's no longer in the same store and if he's no longer working, so on the clock and he no longer feels the need to say that.

1ertkjj,li2vt31,commentsOnPizza,"""Allow"" doesn't mean that they gave the protestors explicit support in their actions. It can mean that they didn't stop the protestors from doing the action when they became aware of it.

For example, under Title IX, a university has to take action against a student or professor who sexually harasses people. A university that allows that behavior to continue (even if they never sanctioned it to begin with) is violating the rights of those being harassed. The school can't say ""we hate the behavior and wish it would stop,"" and take no action. The school is required to take action to stop it.

&gt; As an analogy, if I shoved someone else on campus, you can‚Äôt say that UCLA allowed me to do so. And then someone else sues UCLA and the judge decides that UCLA can‚Äôt allow someone to shove a student on campus.

If UCLA knows that you're constantly shoving people on campus, they should kick you out (though they might not have an obligation to in this hypothetical). But let's create a hypothetical where they do have to take action:

Let's substitute ""sexually harassing"" for ""shoving"". UCLA *must* act on that information (ex. investigate and if the allegations are true must take action against you for sexually harassing students on campus). If they don't take action against you, they're in trouble.

They can't *allow* your actions to continue. ""Allow"" can mean ""I explicitly permit you to do that."" It can also mean ""I don't stop you from doing that."" In your analogy, UCLA isn't explicitly permitting you to shove people. If students complain and UCLA says, ""we're not going to do anything about it,"" then they are ""allowing"" your behavior in the second definition of ""not stopping you from doing that."" Universities do have certain obligations to stop certain behaviors if they become aware of them - and employers too. Even if the action isn't permitted by the university or employer, they may be required to take steps to prevent it when it becomes known to them.

An employer can't say ""we know Bob is sexually harassing people, but that's not our problem. We wish he'd stop, but we aren't going to do anything about it."" No, the employer must take action.

Arguing that UCLA has no obligation to stop known harassment would be the right-wing position and undermine a lot of our civil rights law. I don't think that's what you're arguing. I think that you just got hung up on the word ""allow"" because it made it sound like UCLA was explicitly permitting the behavior rather than the other definition - not stopping it. But I hope you can see how universities and employers can have an obligation to stop certain behaviors to protect vulnerable populations and how important that is for civil rights law.",97,1723646194.0,t1_li15tit

Sorry but your right to protest is not more important than my right to sleep, attend class, live my life.

-edit-
Regardless of your stance, you need to understand that your rights are not more important than others rights. 

The fact that protestors caused many students: 
1. mental and emotional stress (students suffered sleep deprivation due to protestors noise volume throughout the day/night and inability to focus/study/attend finals in person causing many significant stress)
2. financial distress (students were unable  to access education-what students are paying a great deal of money)

3.physical distress(students were physically blocked from being able to attend class - some students were actually attacked and went to hospital)

4.verbal distress (students were harassed, name called and threatened)

1ccwbro,l18fjju,thecrispynaan,"Indiscriminate bombing was used in WW2 in Dresden and resulted in 25k people killed almost overnight. 

Indiscriminate firebombing in Tokyo in WW2 March 9-10 1945 killing 100k people overnight. 

What Israel is doing is terrible and resulting in a lot of unnecessary civilian death , but is not what I would personally call ‚Äúindiscriminate bombing‚Äù . The rate of death is far less than these two examples of indiscriminate bombing.

Edits for even more clarity on my stance here:

Yes the civilian death toll is high after months of conflict. Yes Israel is using way too massive of ordinance for the job being done. Yes they have stopped roof knocking. All these things are terrible and leading to unnecessary loss of life, however indiscriminate bombing indicates massive amounts of ordinance in a short amount of time to inflict as much damage as possible INDISCRIMINATELY regardless of civilian, industrial, or military targets. 

Yes Israel is doing a lot of bombing, but clearly they are aiming at specific location. Sometimes those locations are poorly chosen. But to say it is indiscriminate is incorrect.

1chpw2t,l25wzma,Larkfor,"ABC identified a group of them as campus security, they were standing a short walk away from the group watching these people be attacked (sometimes it was four pro-Israeli assaulters physically attacking one woman).

Pro-Palestinian protesters were keeping in the bounds of the encampment unless pulled out or trying to keep hold of barricades or stop bear spray or sticks, especially when they were poking sticks at the women in the encampment.  They were standing in formation with umbrellas out and wooden planks alligned together as a defense.  It was a siege.  And an unsuccessful one.

When the cops finally arrived they just stood around while the people attacking the camp (the pro Israeli side) suddenly dropped or hid their weapons (there is a cache of weapons in the bushes in one of the livestreams) and were shouting ""USA USA"" and ""COPS ARE OUR HEROES"" and then shouting at the encampment ""COPS ARE ABOUT TO FUCK YOU UP"" and then saying other obsequious things to the arriving cops who mostly ignored them and then in some cases gently passively told them to leave the lawn adjacent to the encampment.

The only thing the cops did right (bare minimum) was that they moved their bodies in a spaced out non violent slow moving line to separate the two groups and they did not invade the encampment.

The Zionist and Proud Boy attackers trickled away and were gone by dawn.

The encampment lasted the whole night doing their own medical care, legal recorders and representatives documenting everything and every detail.

The cops arrested nobody but I think a lot of the pro-Israel assaulters are probably going to have charges of some sort because they are on camera committing assault and a lot of them didn't do a very good job with their ski masks.",24,1714604005.0,t1_l259qld

Campus security was standing by watching (which was apparent from the livestream, they were watching this unfold a short walk away and standing still letting women and other people in the encampment be assaulted with fists, sticks, fireworks, ripped up barricades, and bear spray).

According to students in the encampment they were also laughing at this.

911 calls were hung up on, not responded to.  One ambulance finally did come for one protester while there were fireworks going on and immediately left without additional assistance for the protesters.

2. Hamas has killed substantially less people than Israel has. Around 40x less. 1.2k &lt; 40k

Don't get mad at numbers.

3. Israel has promised even without Hamas their will be no two state solution, while Hamas has stated at least in words (don't take it as truth) they would surrender for a two state solution.

4. Hamas is a terrorist organization funded by a foreign adversary. Protesting against Hamas is like protesting against North Korea, their is literally no way you can possibly affect North Korea or Hamas as their is basically no US/Western influence on Hamas the same way Israel has.

5. Israel is already getting its maximal amount of support, it has mass funds from almost all western countries. If everyone became pro-Israel, their will literally be no change in the war, so ultimately it is quite pointless to be Pro-Israel as it really is about keeping the status quo. 

____________________________________

If everyone was Pro-Palestinian a two state solution will occur, a lasting peace could occur if all sides agree that such a solution is good. The Palestinians will finally feel vindicated as their long fight is over, they have a homeland and can finally have sovereignty. Israel will feel bad, but the violence against Israel will stop because terrorism ends when the foreign nation leaves the native land. Why do you think Afghanistan isn't an issue towards the US.

_______________________________________

If everyone was Pro-Israeli (at least in the West not the east), then no two state solution will occur, Gaza will likely become an Israeli settlement and Terrorism will continue to brew, more deaths will occur as the war in Gaza will become like stage 4 cancer as almost everyone will become a terrorist. Imagine how you'd feel if your mom, dad, brother, sister, home, dog, cat, grandma, job, all got destroyed by an enemy. And then you become occupied by said enemy. 

The only plausible route to peace with a pro-israel and pro-Bibi stance is to genocide the Palestinians, as it is really the only affective way of preventing the trauma from creating new terrorism.

While it's great that online citizens had identified many of them, and that cable news media has followed up on this, and confirmed some of what has been passed around on social media but these assaults should never have happened at all. Protesters and counter-protesters should have remained separated. 

Gene Block is the Chancellor of UCLA. Formerly popular, soon to retire. His base salary is around 668K per year. He supposedly isn't leaving UCLA altogether, just returning to research and resigning his Chancellor position, one he has held since circa 2006? This all happened on his watch. It shouldn't have, but he's an executive not the person to whom campus safety was delegated. Still, the buck stops at his desk and there are numerous vocal and written calls for him to resign now after these horrific failures, both the attacks of 4/30 and the decision to use riot cops from CHP and LAPD to clear the encampment, which had been put into a more resolute defensive posture after the mob attacks.
In charge of safety was Administrative Vice Chancellor Michael Beck, who oversees the UCLA Police Department and on May 5th he was NOT replaced but supplanted by Rick Braziel, when Gene Block moved oversight and management of UCLA PD and the Office of Emergency Management from the Office of the Administrative Vice Chancellor to a newly created Office of Campus Safety. Block did NOT fire or replace Beck, he simply wedged in the former Sacramento top cop Braziel into the flow chart. That way there's no admission of fault on the part of UCLA, and a shielding of Beck as are are left with just the supposed proactive move to do better in the future, a new guy and some empty promises to investigate themselves.

Beck has not spoke to the press. Block has not held a press conference. Not one of the attackers from 4/30 have been arrested.

Then you have UCLA Police Chief John Thomas , head of campus police. He tried to make the excuse that when he called LAPD for help on 4/30 that they obstructed and stalled the response due to a problem with payroll issues.

(The Mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, denies this. )

Thomas has his issues, and isn't coming across well YET. Look to hear less about him or from him in the future. Were a scapegoat to be named, it would be Thomas. But firing him would be an admission of failure of Beck and Block and UCLA and that wont play well in a lawsuit. I am guessing the administration will protect Thomas as long as it can. 

&gt;John Thomas, the chief of the UCLA police department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But he told the Daily Bruin his officers came under attack while helping an injured woman and had to leave. He placed the number of officers at five to six. Sources told The Times the number was four. (LA Times) 

This seems to be in regards to the fact that when an ambulance and 2-3 cops cars arrived before midnight, they then all drove away as the assaults continued.  Eventually the media may start putting two plus two together on things like this.  It's not a good look.  If his officers cam under attack, we need to see the bodycam.  Don't hold your breath tho. We will never get that, not for at least two years I would bet, after a lawsuit and the appeal.  

UCLA Police Chief John Thomas was asked to draw up a written plan for security, it's claimed and it's also said he did not. In his defense, he advised against allowing the protests encampment ever be allowed. The unnamed shadow players here are the anonymous sources who spoke to the press about the lack of a written plan. I seriously doubt a reporter called them, instead I bet they called the reporter to plant the story and shape the narrative in defense of Beck and Block.
 
The question of who allowed the camp versus who didn't keep the camp safe is shaping up to be one possible ""big question."" Beck could be charged by the public as having been liable for both, and that leaves Block and Thomas at odds, or as potential allies to name Beck as the scapegoat. Who can say?  

The usual solution for these sorts of problems is to circle all the wagons and protect everyone by remaining silent. That's what the lawsuit lawyers would want to see. Never admit fault. 

Mary Osako, the vice chancellor for strategic communications. She's the spokesperson / public relations gatekeeper. 

Unnamed at present but surely working behind the scenes are some very esteemed scandal management consultants who are helping those in power deflect, stall, obfuscate and spin the narrative here. 

I'd like to see them all, everyone involved in this debacle fired, sued and forced to turn over all their records and communications. These were federal hate crimes, arguably and the response to them has been dangerously inadequate. We should have have transparency first, and coverups and scandal management last.  But even if the FBI were to weigh in, and the DoJ charge hate crimes, that doesn't mean the feds would ever investigate the failings of the administration in protecting the students.  That's why you have to be careful.  One can demand gene Block resign, sure but what really needs to happen is that he REMAIN in office but be suspended pending a credible investigation. If he retires (which I suspect will happen vis soon) he gets his pension and never has to answer questions. Same with all the others.  This is how power becomes unaccountable.  This is how things can be made to appear to be respectable and at the same time be completely corrupt.",4,1715919746.0,t3_1ctfz8f

Perhaps because, as the OP very clearly explains, he -left a note- describing the emergency they were experiencing downstairs for the benefit of his non-communicative upstairs neighbors.

As to why non-communicative:

Is it even remotely possible their caution had anything to do with the rape of the Saxon Suites resident in July by a criminal who broke into her bedroom after he‚Äôd already barged into and been thrown out of another residential unit by its occupants after knocking on their door earlier that same evening?

Or could it be that the OP‚Äôs upstairs neighbors are in some way disabled (remember: not all disabilities are necessarily visible to the untrained eye), which could account for the noises reported by the OP as well as their failure to respond verbally to the knock on their door?

As was widely reported by news orgs after the arrest, ‚ÄúUCLA police encourage students to report any suspicious activity to them at (310) 825-1491.‚Äù

Reminder: there is no universal definition of, nor standard for testing, what is ‚Äúsuspicious.‚Äù

Or are you all so isolated in your own bubble universes that you never consider such possibilities, or learn about such real world events?

Newsflash: It‚Äôs not always about YOU, folks.

Obviously, the upstairs neighbors here immediately read the note and correctly reported its contents in a call to UCPD whose representative, instead of instantly sending officers to the location, correctly called UC Maintenance who, in turn, informed them that an emergency at that location had indeed been reported by the OP.

Surely a UCPD rep professional enough to handle the call this way ALSO called the upstairs neighbor back and informed them that the emergency was real, the note legitimate and the person who left it their actual downstairs neighbor. 

And since everyone involved now knows everything is on the up and up, in what respect, exactly, was it inappropriate or weird for the UC Maintenance rep to have called back the OP and informed him of this turn of events, both to insure they knew the upstairs neighbors were aware of the emergency and to prevent the initiation of any undesired contact between them by either party?

Bottom line is that no matter who you are, you are taking a risk opening a door to strangers.

And I absolutely don't think those who use drugs are lesser which you insinuate with the word ""druggie."" I was merely pointing out that even in this single instance which says nothing about statistics, it is likely she knew the murderer, which is common. Aka, it's not like a true crime video where he was some random serial killer or a guy walking down the street who did eenie meenie minee moe on the windows deciding which girl he was gonna kill. And that your example is not really a good argument. 

Also, I did not say that you should just open the door for whoever. If she was really so scared, the likely response is to not turn the lights on and not open the door and wait for them to go away, which he did, so I would assume it was probably nothing. Or to ask how she can help him through the door. 

Even in your insanely specific scenario where her ex boyfriend is threatening to send someone to kill her, she would have obviously told that to police because that's extremely important context and would make her be taken more seriously. Then they would have done a more thorough investigation, and likely would have ended up interviewing the guy once they found out who knocked on her door. They also would have taken further steps because that whole situation really should have been reported to police already and if it hadn't been they would have needed to get all the details from her about that now that she had told them. No, instead the cops came because someone reported a scary and threatening looking guy knocked on her door, police did their due diligence and investigated, maintenance told them they had just sent up her downstairs neighbor due to a plumbing issue, and they told her it's all fine and left. Case closed. 

Also, even if she has trauma associated with strange men. That is in fact something she should get therapy for and work on. Your feelings are valid, but how you act on them is not always. I am someone who does suffer from diagnosed PTSD. Luckily, my trauma is not associated with any protected classes. But I still don't have the right to lash out at anyone who triggers me. I am in therapy for this, and I learn very useful skills related to emotional regulation, distress tolerance and other such methods to emotionally regulate better.

Also, any professional would say what I am saying about receiving help (granted they wouldn't say it so bluntly to a patient). Trauma responses are what were once adaptive responses becoming maladaptive now that the cause of the trauma is gone. The first step to recovery is recognizing there is an issue. Also kind of funny that it's related, but today in therapy we talked about how self sabotage can often appear to be self preservation in the moment and how it's important we internalize the difference. 

Also, the reason it is so important to deal with your trauma related issues is not only to help yourself, but to not harm those around you. If the police had came and he was still at the door and they racially profiled him or went off what she said to think he was armed and shot him, that would be a terrible tragedy and consequence of her actions.

Also I am not saying that they don't happen, or that you shouldn't take steps to protect yourself. I even stated above that she could have not responded or asked him who he was with the barrier of the door between them.

I was paying 2500 a month in SF only to see human shit outside my apartment I expected long Beach to be the same and was absolutely surprised how much better it is here. That's not to say I saw a train wreck of neighborhoods while I was shopping for an apartment. I found a place, a few blocks from the beach under 2000. I saw multiple apts ranging from 1500 to 2500. My new apartment is 750sqft. My Bay area apartment was 600 feet, and it was more rectangular than square, it sucked.  So it's not impossible, the only downside to searching from across the state was that I spent almost 800 dollars on application fees. 

I applied and got denied for 4 months, and I promised myself that I wouldn't settle either. My new apartment had to be the first floor, and had some sort of parking. Had I not been so picky I could have found a place much sooner and probably shittier.

So that's my personal LA story, maybe I see things differently from LA residents coming from the Bay. The joke with my Bay Area friend is that it's fuckin Gotham City, no neighborhood up there is safe from anything. And finding an apartment under 2000k in Bay area is fucking impossible, you literally gotta move to Antioch or some boarding Bay City to get an ""affordable"" place.

#Right-wing groups, including on Reddit, have been planning this after violence at UT Austin

They were complaining ""the optics"" made Texas look bad and planned where it could happen in states like California

More information about their tactics on Reddit:

#Conservatives on Reddit brag about brigading to ""red pill"" ""control the narrative"" about liberal cities and blue states

&gt;The real value is getting into a thread early and establishing top voted posts and comments or downvoting them out of existence.

They hope intertia continues the trend for them.

By pushing race-baiting videos of ""a minority behaving badly somewhere"" and every ""bad"" story to the top of targeted local subreddits (but not *their* local ones, even though [conservative areas statistically have more homicides and crime](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/ln1sif/turning_point_usa_and_young_americas_foundation/h52c2bb/) and [LA is one of the safest cities in America](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/uqg80k/not_bad_los_angeles/), those aren't their top posts every single day in their local subreddits)

&gt;They also use Discord and post Reddit links to threads there to brigade‚Ä¶.i snuck into one around 2020 and those needledick‚Äôs would send 100s of different racist profiles to mostly threads where African Americans commited crimes‚Ä¶.especially when there was an AA assaulting an Asian person. They love attacking blue city subs and publicfreakout.

&gt;[r SeattleWA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/pmdp2m/ysk_how_right_wing_trolls_brigade_and_infiltrate/) has one mentally ill man who makes literally dozens and dozens of alt accounts to post conservative talking points from and how he finds black women disgusting. I become aware of his accounts when he posts in TV subs I ban him from, and he always has user history in similar sets of subreddits across his accounts, SeattleWA being the most telling. He will use these accounts to talk with himself or dogpile a comment or thread.

One Texas conservative in [r/sanfrancisco](https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/pbi4mp/shouldnt_rbayarea_join_the_subs_calling_for/) was 10 different accounts, all having a history of identical comments (some comments about living in Texas), sometimes pretending to be annoying woke strawman ""S J W"" saying there is no crime by blacks so that his own alts can reply with black crime talking points

&gt;They are right wing political activists actively working to discredit the progressive movement and democrats in general by ensuring San Francisco is painted as a failure in all contexts they can find. Basic political astroturfing. San Francisco is targeted because it is in California and Pelosi is from here. This work has been going on for decades.

It's hard to deny the brigading when SF and the Bay Area poll less than 30% on issues like the Governor Newsom recall but the posts in these subreddits were **literally 100% pro-recall (every single comment is pro-recall) until much later in the day** The posts get more normal votes later but normal people don't have the time and energy to do what those accounts are doing

&gt;Wow. Jesus. This is... really, really thorough. Thank you for putting in all this hard work.

&gt;When I was a teenager, I spent a lot of time on /b/, /pol/, 888chan, etc. It was a slow descent and I didn't even realize what was happening until it was almost too late.

&gt;But during my time on the other side, this was 100% the gameplan. They'd make ""sock puppets"" and coordinate on the board + IRC (showing my age here) to selectively choose targets to brigade.

&gt;Depending on the target, you'd either have some talking points to ""debate"" (sometimes with yourself/other anons working alongside you) or you'd go in there guns blazing trying to cause as much damage/chaos as you can. However, even then you can't go out there yelling slurs (you'd just get banned instantly); you have to maintain some level of plausible deniability by framing things as ""jokes"" or thought experiments.

&gt;You purposely do bad-faith arguments because the time it takes for them to dig up sources and refute you is longer than it takes for you to make stuff up. You can vary how obvious the bad faith argument is; when you want to troll you make very stupid claims (I once claimed I was a graduate of ""Harvad University"" and when people assumed that I meant ""Harvard"" I would correct them right down to Photoshopped images).

&gt;When you just want to cause dissent you do exactly what those /pol/ screenshots do: you get to a thread early (sometimes you even make it yourself) and present reasonable-sounding arguments which are completely false if anyone bothers to look into them. If someone does, you bury the message under strawmen, downvotes, reports, and sockpuppets.

&gt;So yeah. The tactics have evolved slightly, but I still recognize them. Props to you on doing the digging to find all this stuff and bring it into the light.

&gt;I doubt that it'll help in the majority of cases, mind. People on Reddit have already made up their mind. You want to go after the forums and BBSes, on the MSN News comments and whatnot. Even so, the more people who are aware of the tactics the more people who can call them out.

The importance of good footage for Fox News to show:

&gt;Every day I have to marvel at what the billionaires and FOX News pulled off. They got working whites to hate the very people that want them to have more pay, clean air, water, free healthcare and the power to fight back against big banks &amp; big corps. It‚Äôs truly remarkable.

#John Ehrlichman, who partnered with Fox News cofounder Roger Ailes on the Republican ""Southern Strategy"":

&gt;[We] had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I‚Äôm saying?

&gt;We knew we couldn‚Äôt make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

&gt;We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.

&gt;Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

&gt;""He was the premier guy in the business,"" says former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. ""He was our Michelangelo.""

&gt;Ailes repackaged Richard Nixon for television in 1968, papered over Ronald Reagan‚Äôs budding Alzheimer‚Äôs in 1984, shamelessly stoked racial fears to elect George H.W. Bush in 1988, and waged a secret campaign on behalf of Big Tobacco to derail health care reform in 1993.

&gt;Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting ‚Äúreal people affected by taxes.‚Äù

I personally would say no. 

I don't know all the details of exactly who is to blame for the violent circumstances of the results of the 1947 partition plan. I do know that the violence was not in any way one-sided. That's not to defend Israel's part in it whatsoever.

Regardless, I don't think you can say an ideology is inherently evil/bad/repulsive because some people behaved immorally in the name of it.

Again, if we're being consistent and one disagrees with that, then the Palestinian desire for self-determination would also be a poisoned ideology. So would Ukrainians desire for the same thing. It could apply to plenty of things.

1gap5zs,lttwcg2,Dry-Neck9762,"My bf of 6 years used to wake me up in the middle of the night much in the same way. The bed would start shaking, like there was an earthquake, which would wake me up, and this usually was accompanied by some horrific screaming, the likes of which one only usually heard when someone is terrified for their life.  I would gently give him  a little nudge on his shoulder and call his name until he awoke.  When he woke, the response would usually be ""what?"" Like he had no clue what was going on.  

Beyond feeling terrible for him experiencing something so horrifying in his dreams, I was honestly scared the neighbors would think someone was being stabbed to death in our house and call the cops, or something!

One night, I woke up to find him straddling my chest, with both of his hands near my neck (just on my clavicle bone), and gently pushing down on it, with no greater pressure than a cat making biscuits, and his eyes were wide open, but he was completely sound asleep.  I called out his name several times, and he had no response, just kept lightly pressing down on my clavicle, as though he was trying to murder me in my sleep, but not really.  After saying his name several times, I eventually just rolled him off of me and he fell off the bed, onto the floor, and sat up and asked ""what happened,?""

So, long story short, he was bipolar/schizophrenic, off his meds.  He would get bouts of paranoia, calling me at work hourly, accusing me of spying on him from work, called my mother once, asking if she had seen me, in a creepy way that scared her so much that she was worried he chopped me up and buried me under the patio, or something.

He would go into this state of mind I called ""dark Justin"" because there was no reasoning with him about anything.  If he said he liked the color green, I would say it was a nice color, then he would say how much he would hate it (that isn't a literal example, but that's how those discussions would go - like arguing with Rumpelstiltskin.

So he just kept getting worse and worse, until I started having to sleep with one eye open and a backpack with a change of clothes in it, so I could just get the fuck out of dodge and go crash at a friends pad, the minute he would step out of the room.

I attempted to have his family intervene, begging them to come get him, that he really needed some help, but when they called to talk to him, he would just tell them he and I had an argument, and he was okay, no need to worry.

Meanwhile, he started pretending to pass out, and then would call 911, getting the fire dept to show up, and a few times the police, which was really a nightmare, because what can you do?  If you just leave, then the cops will think you did whatever he would say you did, and come after you, so I would have to just sit there until they showed up 

One night, I was watching TV, sitting on the sofa.  I saw him walk into the kitchen with a fucking pillow!   I heard pots and pans being moved about for a few minutes, and then, nothing.    So, I got up to investigate, and found him with the gas oven wide open, all of the gas burners wide open, with no flame, and he was sitting on the floor, in front of the stove, with his head resting in his arms, like it was nap time in kindergarten.  He was trying to kill himself, and me!

During another episode, I watched him go into the kitchen, heard him ratting around under the sink for something, and he came into the living room with a bottle of liquid draining, which he proceeded to open and dump into our amazing salt water aquariomum (we spent years and $$ puttibg this thing together), and I watched helplessly as EVERYTHING started to die, instantly!  Convulsing fish, beautiful coral, plants, all of the colors completely disappeared, leaving only a washed out aqua moonscape (everything just turned gray like ash).  I was like, ""wtf, Justin, why tf did you fucking do that?!  His explanation - I can't afford to take care of them anymore (he wasnt paying for anything, anyway, so?!!)

The aquarium was such a horrific scene that even one of the officers that had previously been to the house asked about what happened, yet did nothing about it.  

There is so much more to this story, but I have said more than I initially planned to write so I will fast forward.   One night, about 4am, I heard Justin on the phone with someone.  I figured it was about time dark Justin came around, so I just left.  I stayed at my safehouse, and went to work from there.

When I arrived at home, after work, Justin's car was in the driveway, but he was nowhere to be found.  A few minutes later, the phone rang, and it was Justin. He said he had talked to his cousin last night (from what I did hear, Justin was up to his crazy talk about a dark lord, prince of angels and sounded pretty nutz!). His cousin was so concerned, apparently bought Justin a 1-way bus ticket to his parents home.  They hospitalized him for a bit.  But it didn't seem to be much help.  There's way more to this part, but I will just say that he wound up hanging himself at his parents home.

This whole mess lasted about a year, after he got laid off from his job, stopped taking meds he could no longer afford, wouldn't find work, I had to take on all of the expenses, his parents would not take me seriously.  I even managed to take him to be evaluated at a local hospital, and they said  we just need to work things out 

I truly loved him, and I did everything I could possibly think of to try to help him, but he could not be helped by me or anyone else.  He attempted to kill me several times during all of this, and no judge would allow me to take out a restraining order, landlord couldn't evict him without evicting me, since we were both on the lease.  I was so distraught after learning he had hung himself, it was at least 2-3 years before I even considered dating again!

I'm happy to say I am going on 7years, now, with my current relationship, and we are thriving.  But I still think about Justin and all he was going through, all he put myself and his family through during his struggle.

My advice to OP - CONTACT HIS FAMILY, TRY TO GET HIM SONE HELP, AND GET THE FUCK OUT IF THAT SITUATION, OR YOU MAY BE KILLED!  I AM NOT EVEN JOKING!

1fbnz2v,lm307i3,ShiinaYumi,"I'll summerize as best I can because there are a lot of issues within the fertility industry, but in short, there are almost no actual medical/health regulations, despite what clinics say there's no mandated regulation, and there can be emotional issues for some people in terms of connecting with their bio parents etc and it becomes quiet a mess when donations are supposed to be anonymous etc. 

There have been plenty of cases, too, where sperm donors where told oh you'll probably help create x number of kids but people cut the sperm and create way more causing a lot of issues. When it comes to egg donation the lack of regulations has almost killed donors because of over harvesting eggs. 

Now none of this is to say donation is bad not at all! I think it can be an amazing thing. I just think ethically it's best to donate for the right reasons (helping people having children) but go into it fully understanding your health as best you can, be honest, and understand you are hopefully helping create a whole human who may want to know you, and be willing to be understanding about that and keep lines of communication open in case of health issues coming up etc. 

Right now you can go get paid to jack off which sounds great but down the line you may have a kid (or many!) Knocking on your door needing health info or wanting to know who they are. And despite the fertility industry trying to put into contracts that donor children aren't allowed to take at home DNA tests (which is all kinds of problematic imo) it will become harder and harder to avoid. If that isn't a responsibility you can handle or you KNOW you have genetic health issues please don't donate (not because people with issues shouldn't have children but because the industry is so shady about disclosing information it can put the possible human being created at risk or even the person carrying the pregnancy causing needless suffering.)

We aren't humans to the fertility industry in the US, we are simply a product (that they pay donors almost nothing for to make massive gains on) and are treated to that end. There are also no lawsuit regulations in place for mishaps. 

For more and frankly MUCH better information and understanding donor concieved people and advocacy about us and the fertility industry (and it's gross lack of regulations) I highly recommend looking up Laura High! She's on tiktok and Instagram and I think pretty much all platforms actually ü§î

And this is the SHORT explanation. There are a lot of complex issues and feelings regarding donation so all I ask is people pause and think about what's happening, the position they're in and to try and move forward with the least harm possible üíñ

1d49w2z,l6f223l,kirklandbranddoctor,"Hi.  A Korean American physician here.  For the sake of anonymity I won't identify in what capacity I attended UCLA, but can tell you I didn't go to its med school.  I did go to one of the ""top"" med schools (comparable to UCLA, I'd say) that also happened to practice what UCLA med school is doing.

First off... don't worry too much about ""unqualified"" candidates becoming licensed physicians.  Med school is a brutal process where you're expected to learn and memorize ungodly amount of information in extremely short periods of time (it is often compared to ""drinking from a fire hose"")... and that's the easy part of training to become a physician (compared to residency, medical school looks like a kindergarten with too much play time scheduled in its curriculum).

Did ""unqualified"" students made through our admission process? Absolutely.  Then they fell behind almost immediately, because like I said - fire hose of information.  Unless you're smart (and I mean exceptionally smart), it is essentially impossible to keep up.  Each *lecture* is essentially equivalent to one college course.

Very unfortunately, a lot of these unqualified students were indeed DEI admissions.  And very unfortunately, the ones who fell behind either dropped out, remediated (and then eventually dropped out), and some ended up committing s**c*de (another very unfortunate thing that happens in disturbingly high frequency in medical training).  

What should be kept in mind though, is that the vast majority of the DEI admissions were indeed successful in medical school (and remember - that means they were smart enough to survive the fire hose of information).  In fact, about 33% of the students who got the AOA Honor Society membership (basically the Honor Roll equivalent) were DEI admits.

So... there can be an argument made that it's cruel to subject people to this brutal process that they can't survive/handle for the sake of diversity.  At the same time, vast majority of diversity admits actually thrived and did really well.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Then that should be the x % in the class.  No more and no less.  Has nothing to do with meritocracy.  Liberals (right or wrong) are ALL about matching what the % are in the real world on their campuses.

So, higher education has WAY TOO MANY asians when asians are only 5% of U.S. and indians are only 1% of U.S.  That is why they always want to cut down on that subset.  They want 50-60% white.  13-15% black and 15-18% latino.  Since those last several are so underrepresented in the healthcare field as active practitioners the feeling is it will take YEARS of overpopulation of med students before you see providers at those rates in the real world. This already happened with female doctors.  That is why there was a concerted effort in ?2014 or so to flip med school to admitting more women around that time and they have continued since then to now.  It was not a coincidence.

For example I see an allergist who is indian and dark-skinned. The first time I met her we had a long conversation about colorism in the medical field. Ever since then I have gone back to see her specifically because I feel like she can relate to me on an individual level and thus would be more likely give me high quality care (even though allergy/immunology has nothing to do with race nor skin color). Idk, maybe my trust in providers has more to do with how empathetic they seem vs their race?

Anyway...for the most part, for specific specialties like anesthesiology I personally don't have as much concern with race, though I will say biases can influence how a doctor treats patients of different races/genders.

Just jumping in to note that Latinos have had relatively recent big jumps in GPA, MCAT scores, and med school acceptance rates across the board (as well as both matriculation and graduation totals being way up for 4-year degrees). GPA and MCAT scores still lag behind white and asian students but lead nearly all other minority groups.

Med school acceptance and matriculation rates are now nearly *identical* to white and Asian students, which points to there being a *much* larger number of latino applicants to med school (which goes with the higher number of 4-year grads). The lower GPA and MCAT scores with near identical acceptance rates shows that there is a bonus for ethnicity, but also shows an ongoing trend towards latinos converging with non-latino whites at the post-secondary level.

Those ratio to 26%/12%/13%/45%/4% in 2019 and 25%/14%/20%/30%/11% in 2022.

At the start of 2024, CA had a W/B/H/A/O demographic distribution of 35%/5%/40%/15%/5%.

So, the 2022 class misrepresented the state in multiples of 0.7x/3x/0.5x/2x/2x.

So, yes, Asian enrollment has gone down between 2019 and 2022, but it actually should go down MORE! Asians were 3x their actual CA population ratio and were reduced to 2x, which is still DOUBLE when the Hispanic representation is just HALF. So Asians have a 4x representation relative to Hispanics.

You are arguing from an EQUITY standpoint that all 'races' should gain equivalent access to resources as compensation for unequal circumstances. This seems to be the tact taken by the current Dean of Admissions 

An equity approach attempts to address systemic/historical race-based inequity at the molar level (societal), while re-establishing the practice of race-based discrimination at the molecular level (DGSOM). 

An equality approach removes race-based discriminatory practices at the molecular level (DGSOM), but doesn't address the societal correction of systemic/historical race-based discriminatory practices. 

There is no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" here from a moral standpoint (though there may be from a legal standpoint), they are standards focused on different versions of the same problem. 

We can parse numbers all day, but anyway you slice it, this type of equity approach requires race-based discrimination.

Much of what Hamas did on October 7th was horrible, and I would never wish that on anyone. However, I hope you do some research on what actually happened that day, beyond the made up stories of beheaded babies that Israel keeps spewing. I hope you do some research on how Israel treated its own citizens that day while tryong to repel Hamas. I hope you find some time to do some research on the conditions Israel has imposed on Gaza, condemned by every humanitarian organization. I hope you look into the conditions in the illegally occupied West Bank, where Hamas has little to no presence. I hope you look into what the actual evidence says about Israel's claims about where Hamas is hiding. I hope you do research on how Israel treats and has treated citizens like Arabs, LGBTQ+, Holocaust survivors, non-Ashkenazi Jewish people, and Christians. I hope you do some research on how Israel treats peaceful protestors, including American citizens. I hope you do some research on how Israel treats political prisoners, and how many children are locked up in prison.

After all of that, I hope you do some thinking about what conditions like that, for 75 years and counting, might puch people to do, especially as new generations are born that know nothing else. How would you feel? What tactics would you resort to? The counter-protestors seem like they would do much more than what Hamas did, with much less provocation.

I'm very pro open campus, but I don't think just anyone should be allowed on Campus for political shenanigans, and to pitch tents, because to do so,  isn't pro student. 

ABOVE ALL, all, a university is pro student.  It's policies, descisions procedures must always be made in the interests that are pro student. 

But, the news (specifically channel 7), kept saying that campus security had become increased and heightened during this time, to specifically require student and faculty ID at all times. As such, access would be limited to ONLY students, faculty and alumni having campus access during this time. 

USC was said to have adopted the same increased security protocol, AFTER their violent student protests about a week ago.  So, I felt better, though I was still pretty suspicious.  

Are you telling me now, that the news lied, and in fact, they DID allow non student, non faculty, non alumni community folks on the campus, even to be pitching their tents on the campus, for their political agenda and causes? That's not okay. That's F'ing BULLSHIT, Man. 

Students pay enough money to attend that school, they have a RIGHT and EXPECTATION  to be protected OVER the interests of a community, ESPECIALLY during exams! UCLA is NOT a community park. They do not receive funding to be a local gathering place for outside political movements to gather.  The demonstrators can tent and gather in the local parks. 

It's one thing if the students themselves want to protest, that's completely okay. Media SHOULD cover this, as part  of student affairs.  

It's NOT okay, for outside continuity political movements to make UCLA their political ground zero, manipulating the coverage it then receives, the hospitality of a nations university campus, as well as distrupting the passions of the students. ESPECIALLY during peak exams. FFS. Students cannot simultaneously be protected while simultaneously allowing a community to park it's ass on campus. That's complete, utter BULLSHIT.  

What are people paying UCLA for, if NOT an  environment conductive to churning out the country's next best and brightest?  First they close the campuses to you guys, then it's just an F'ing free for all, for EVERYONE? Your University President needs to step up, AND DO BETTER for you guys!",31,1714567639.0,t1_l22cop0

1chg92z,l25s4l2,Dispator,Not sure if you know this but especially in warm climate places like California...the campus are pretty open and there is nothing surrounding the school...it is just spread out buildings everywhere so it's pretty unrealistic to check everywhere for student IDs.,2,1714602124.0,t1_l232rg3
1chg92z,l260fso,joecoolblows,"I know that, I'm completely okay with that. I'm not an idiot. I graduated from a southern California university as well, have lived here my entire life, and have always LOVED &amp; SUPPORTED open campus policies. It's one of the most endearing policies of higher education, is that ANYONE can walk onto a campus, private or public, and enjoy the beauty, intellectual energy, the collective purpose, the positive atmosphere, and peaceful surroundings. For the most part, it's easy for the public to gain library access, planetarium access, heck, you can even walk into a classroom, though you won't receive credit. These are by design to encourage everyone to realize higher education is, indeed, accessible to anyone who dreams of it. Often, our first first to a campus, is the beginning of that dream. This should never be changed. 

HOWEVER, and, also, despite your attempts to dumb me down with your response, there's a middle line between open campus, and turning the campus into a park for everyone with an agenda, a residence hall for potential skid row residents, or political activists turned tent city residents, or a corporate predatorial free for all playground for credit card companies and other shady corporations who would take up quad residence, to manipulate and exploit kids away from home for the first time, sex offenders and/or terrorist cell recruiters during  the 09/11 era, when many of these policies came about.   

That middle line is exactly WHY we don't have skid row residents, amongst the hammock inhabitants of the quad at Royce Hall. These include measures such as ID checks, and faculty, student, alumni only access during high stress times. Limited Access Campus.   We've done it many, many times, and will continue to do it.  This back and forth, finding balance,  is the nature of humanity.  This is also  decision a good University President is familiar with good University policy will make many, many times, and WHY you even have administration in the first place. 

When things die down, open campus homeostasis is again restored. This is done by simply returning to open campus, with zero fanfare or public announcement. No one cares by then, which is the whole point, and the university doesn't announce it, because THEN everyone WILL suddenly start caring,  and return to stir shit up again. 

THIS is what SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED, earlier this week. This is exactly what will happen quietly at other campuses across the state, right now,  as we speak, who look at Emory, USC AND UCLA, and say, ""Gee. Its time to switch to limited access campus!"" 

It was announced that it was happening, but apparently, either they lied, or didn't enforce it.

So, yes, it's possible to have open campus. It's possible to have limited access. It's possible to do both. It's possibly valid for me to wonder why this isn't being done without being thought to be an idiot. And, it's possible for you to assume I can ask these questions, without you ridiculing my lack of awareness of these things. And, it's possible  for you to learn something, too.

Men and women aren‚Äôt allowed to go to school together.  Hundreds of Palestinian homosexuals are seeking asylum in Israel.  Amidst all this, anyone who supported the Palestinian cause so fervently as to go to jail for it or disrupt classes for it was some combination of moronic and evil.

So yes ‚Äî I do think all Palestinians are guilty.  Good people after October 7 would have revolted against their terrorist leaders

I do feel sorry for the children who were born into this society.  And on an individual level, I do feel sorry for all the Palestinian people who are suffering.  Most people are products of their circumstances.

p.s. in response to hate messages received from you:  the goal of Israel‚Äôs military actions is not to punish the Palestinians.  It is to disable the Palestinians‚Äô ability to carry out another evil terrorist attack like October 7.  Reasonable people could differ on whether Israeli‚Äôs current actions are morally justified.  It‚Äôs somewhat similar to Hiroshima, Dresden, etc.  

If protestors were on campus shouting ‚Äúan eye for an eye makes the whole world blind‚Äù or ‚Äúwar is not the answer‚Äù then I would have respect for them.

Also, equating breaking segregation laws with these protesters breaking laws seems a little off.

When they were arrested, and people read about it in the papers, it forced people to question how to justify jailing someone for sitting quietly in a bus seat.

1ciq2ua,l2bau0i,DenebianSlimeMolds,"this professor makes many logical and rhetorical errors

+ blockading anyone, especially students, forcing them out of spaces, keeping them from using entrances or exits, all through intimidation backed up by actual force or threat of force is violent behavior. it's also behavior that violates the civil rights acts.

+ taking over buildings, defacing buildings, vandalizing buildings is also violent behavior

+ we've seen the video of the campers teaching each other violent methods to deter attackers, a non-violent method of dealing with the cops is to go limp, to retreat, to surrender peacefully

As MLK, Jr, said

&gt; ""One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty.""

so we're not talking about non-violent protesters, though if he wants to argue they weren't high on a scale of violence that's possibly reasonable

In a general scenario, lawyers would take your case on a contingency fee basis (for free basically) if there was a high likelihood you would win a considerable amount of money and they would collect some percentage of that (\~30-40%). However, I'm not sure if that's the case in this scenario and lawyers may ask you to pay hourly (which can be quite expensive \~$300/hr but if there's a large number of people involved this cost can be much lower per person). A better bet may be to find an attorney who's sympathetic to the ""Free Palestine"" movement and will offer significant discounts to the overall costs.

The best method to find an attorney is often going through your social network. Talk to other people and see if they can refer you to attorneys. The next option is outreach. Reaching out to political organizations, low-cost law clinics, law school students (who can either refer you to attorney or willing to help for free or low cost), social media, legal referral agencies, individual attorneys' websites, etc. Try to explain the issues at hand and also express your desire for legal assistance. Technically UCLA has some free/low-cost legal resources but because UCLA may end up being a defendant this may not be helpful and could even be counterproductive (if UCLA decides to retaliate against you).

1cjck8s,l2frsl8,InTheMorning_Nightss,"The problem here is that you can't really hold him legally responsible if he didn't specifically make clear and explicit orders to incite violence.

He posted videos that painted him out to be discriminated against. Obviously this built ill will and animosity towards the protestors, but seemingly all things he said fall within freedom of speech.  

To be clear, *Brandenburg v.. Ohio* determined that individuals *can* be held accountable and punished for speech that is ""*directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action*"" but this would be a REALLY hard thing to prove just based on his videos as, at least to my awareness, at no point did he ever clearly make calls to action to incite violence and assault.

Factor in quite a few things that the SJP represents (i.e. claiming Hamas is a *progressive* organization), and you'd be really, really hard pressed to argue in court that his concerns of safety (even if disingenuous) weren't at least somewhat founded base on the protestors beliefs.",20,1714762378.0,t1_l2f9tx0

My main point for what I said is that we should be able to differentiate between shaming him in public discussion and discourse vs. acting hypocritical on principle and rights just because we don't agree with them.

The hasty connections you make fall short of supporting a defense of your behavior. Our school evaluates students holistically - a process and concept you seem to not understand. Your obsession with numbers and measurements indicates you may not really understand holistic admissions. 

I'll wait here while you look that up to see how it's relevant here. 

You seem to be very concerned with measuring things - GPAs, English proficiencies... we can assume the rest... 
It's a common tendency in juvenile males -

Regardless, if your claim is true about our school being academically intolerant of subpar performances, then I'm not sure how you can make any claims about me possessing a subpar GPA or justify your festering disguntlment about the presence of others you deem ""undesirables"" at this school. 

Further, the school does actually tolerate a degree of mediocrity - circling back to embrassing holistic evaluatations-  because doing so facilitates a higher purpose in intrapersonal actualization - a processes called mortification - which is targeted at those amongst the privileged and entitled. Your angst and disgruntlment  indicate your process is well underway. Glad I could help with that.

Not all speech is protected.   Specifically excluded from the constitutional right to free speech is speech that harms someone.   The typical example of unprotected speech is yelling ‚Äúfire‚Äù in a crowded room, which could cause members of that crowd to be injured in the ensuing panic.  A solid legal argument can be made (if it has not already) that driving around calling African-Americans the worst slur available is outside first-amendment protections precisely because it harms its victims.   Such behavior, if tolerated by society, harms a class of Americans by degrading the quality of their lives.   For that reason, the victims of such unsolicited and cowardly-disseminated slurs can, and in my opinion, should, be held accountable for to their intended victims.   If we allow non-African-American students to psychologically beat down African-American students in this manner we infringe on their right to get an education on the same terms as others.  That is wrong.   In legal terms, the overarching equitable principle is ‚Äúfor every wrong there is a remedy.‚Äù  One remedy available to OP is a tort action to be financially compensated for that wrong with monetary damages and injunctive relief prohibiting future wrongs of this type.",1,1724152783.0,t1_li7f298

1cqpfuz,l3vmem5,[deleted],"US was so incensed by 9/11 that we took down Saddam Hussein, who was completely uninvolved, just to feel something. If the US had been in Israel‚Äôs position, we would have adopted the ‚Äúone state next to a big parking lot‚Äù solution and US citizens would have bumper stickers saying ‚ÄúGaza these nuts‚Äù against a U.S. flag background. 

The reason these protests exist now and didn‚Äôt in the past is because in the past, students lived through the first two intifadas and it wasn‚Äôt hard to decide between one side putting up fences and another side sending children strapped with suicide bombs into crowded public areas to exterminate Jewish non-combatants.",4,1715621106.0,t1_l3thuox

1cqpfuz,l3upl87,[deleted],"appeasement doesn't work. The peace israel has established was done through the understanding that attacking them would lead to catastrophe. They even gave back territory as a peace offering when they didn't have to.

The whole invasion of Iraq was the major blunder of bush. It didn't make any sense because

1)Iraq didn't harbor sunni extremists

2)Saddam was a natural ally in the anti al-qaeda cause

3)it diverted significant war resources away from the real center of jihadi activity(afghanistan/pakistan)

You seem to be insinuating the US should have taken a pacifist approach to the whole thing. That is not only unrealistic, it is foolish. Bin Laden himself would have seen it as a sign of weakness, he had stated in the past he ""respected"" the soviets more for their sheer brutality in combat during the afghan-soviet war.

The leaders of that protest (regarded as successful) were later taken to other countries by the CIA to teach them how to run student protests (Ie. Ukraine).

Sometimes working for things contrary to the ses students real personal and national interests.

Just so you know. The CIA are now allowed to use these and other tactics against the American populace.

First they convinced everyone it was their highest calling to be 'activists'. Then they told you what to be activists for 'racism', 'privalege', 'sexism'...

They use your perception of your values and ideals  against you to do their dirty work.

Yugoslav civil war. Croatia, Serbia,  Bosnia three way rumble. 

UN (ahem US) 80 days of air raids and bombing. Infinite external agitation to convince the citizens to rise against the leadership.

The CIA pulled out all the stops because Yugoslavia/Serbia had insanely strong financial position (gold reserves to keep everything running despite embargo) and national resource independence (food stuff, raw materials etc) and highly educated and intelligent citizens (tons of engineers and science education) and incedibly hard work ethic. Traditional embargo couldn't break them because everyone had family that had rural self sustaining farms that could keep people fed.

US deploying depleted uranium rounds which should be a war crime. Essentially salting the fields a la Rome conquest of Carthage.

The banks used tje regional mixed ethnic heritage to turn them against themselves so EU (Germany) could swoop in and pick up assets for pennies on dollar. Eg. Fiat bought an auto factory that was a national Yugo car factory. 

They convinced Croatia they could join EU fast track if they dump Yugoslavia. And they sided with Catholic europe against their own similar culture onside Yugoslavia. I suppose regionally annoyed by the Serb central power of the combined country.

Then it repeated in Bosnia.

The bullshit with Kosovo is straight up UN, EU, US instigation (similar to Ukraine). Ethic serbs in that country living without legal protection or rule of law under Albanian ethnic persecution. Whole thing a front for EU raping the regional resources. Kosovo is a puppet state now. Congrats. Look into how well things are going for people there now and Albania.

US, EU etc can't stand any countries existing outside the big bank hegemony. Economic and resource independence will get you invaded every time. Ask Khadafi or other mid east states.

All for greedy ruling classes to open economic markets and steal resources. Like every war in the history of the world really.

My gfs guy friend who were drafted and forced to fight are all embarrassed about it. Maybe not all but most of them. They realize how tricked they were.

Weirdly Croatia are still resentfully of Serbs.

Mujahideen brought into Bosnia from other CIA developed hot spots that attempted to stay and impart fundamentalist practices after the war. 

Total shame.

Half of this is conspiracy theory tin foil stuff but there is a gain of truth is everything I wrote here.

Both Pro-Palestinian and Pro-Israel students will sue due to the lack of safety, and I could see some students not involved also sue due to disruption of the school's services (along with lack of safety due to all protestors/counter protestors).  

Chances are that the strongest lawsuits will come from law-abiding students (i.e. non-protestors) who felt the studies they paid for and their perceived lack of safety were not upheld by the university.  It's frankly going to be a much higher uphill battle for any protestors/counter-protestors due to them likely having broken laws/university rules and frankly endangering themselves.  So long as UCLA followed all the appropriate protocols (calling the police, deploying security, etc.), it will be hard to find them at fault.  That then naturally puts you wanting to sue police departments for their inactivity... which... good luck.

1cikrga,l2bhpxv,InTheMorning_Nightss,"No disrespect taken!  Just my analysis:

* I don't think non-protesting students have a *good* chance, but I think they have a *better* chance.  They were denied education *and* an unsafe environment.  Frankly, Jewish students were likely the most impacted because they likely felt the most discrimination from other students, which UCLA openly allowed.
* Protesting students have the same right not to be abused by counter protestors.  The issue is, that's not UCLA's job to command the police force.  They likely followed all appropriate and sufficient protocols, and the physical violence that occurred 2 nights ago isn't something they as an institution could reasonably prevent once they notified the police department and had them come in.  What are they supposed to do?  Send their student staff to stop this fighting?  That's an even bigger lawsuit.
* Protesting students who were ""abused"" by the police are gonna have a pretty fucking hard time here.  The police force have specific mob/incident response and they aren't exactly going to get penalized for realistically following that.  As much as you want to yell, ""They shot rubber bullets!"" that was also in response to protestors assaulting them with fire extinguishers.

Overall, I just don't see that strong of cases.  Frankly, them  cancelling classes and doing hybrid/remote learning probably saved them some strife in these lawsuits, because all of the safety hazards were specific to campus.",3,1714691396.0,t1_l2bbrwk
1cikrga,l6fx3ce,Ok_Percentage7257,"I read your analysis: Legally, there is no proof that the Jewish students were impacted. They would have to show the protestors saying anti-Jewish terms. The investigations by various organizations show no proof of that. In fact, there are some Jewsih students who took videos of themselves proving students and they did not succeed in getting reactions. 

Your second point is not legally accurate. If any students are in danger, the university has the obligation to call the police. Let's say instead of people attacking protesters, some one with a gun came in to kill all the students, the university has the obligation to call the police. the university did not call the police because they discriminated against the protesters. The lawyers will have to prove that the protesters were neglected which they can. 

Your third point is also not legally accurate. The police have no right to arrest the protesters. When they do, the protesters are released automatically from the station. The arrests are only happening to humiliate the students. This process is recycled. Also, if you observe, during these arrests most of the police officers don't wear their badges. It's illegal to arrest students without a badge. When students point that out, they are released.

Here's the thing: It is perfectly reasonable to believe that Israel has overstepped in its response. The JIDF is not doing enough to protect Palestinian civilians. 

However, the rhetoric at these protests lacks nuance and clarity. When you go chanting ""globalize the intifada,"" surely you can't be surprised when people think you're chanting in support of terrorism. But hey, don't take my word for it. Take [Norman Finkelstein's.](https://www.tiktok.com/@nyxnyc/video/7359761825673628974)",4,1714678606.0,t1_l2ac72e

Furthermore, the intifada simply means the Palestinian revolution that occurred after the nakba, in which Palestinians attempted to retake their land after having it taken by Israelis after WW2 and being killed. Therefore, when people say ‚Äúlong life the intifada‚Äù that simply means that they want the Palestinians to succeed in their uprise against Israel, which again, to some seem scary but to others is completely justifiable for a people to reclaim their old home that was taken from them less than 100 years ago, which in terms of the entirety of history is considered a very recent time. Now, I am against any killing of any innocent civilians on either side, because after all they are innocent. However on October 7th, the amount of civilians killed keep dropping on numbers, going from 1700 to almost 1000 individuals. This statistic also includes soldiers. Now, for people on the outside this attack seems outrageous but with the context of it all, the people inside of Gaza saw this as a way of saying ‚Äústop killing our people and treating us like shit, bc even though we can‚Äôt stop you we sure as well can throw a final punch and allow the world to help us‚Äù. Israel has abused Palestine for a bit less than 100 years because they obtain some of the strongest allies in the world. Therefore, because many of the protestors in the SJP and other organizations have family members, friends, or ties with people inside of Gaza, they know exactly what‚Äôs going on and the reason behind the attack on October 7th.

I'm sorry, but unless you want UCLA to go out of its way to provide additional resources and safety for protestors 24/7 (which is an unreasonable request), I don't see what other other choice it could have made.

Each dispatcher speaking to students and every officer/emergency responder on UCLA grounds is one less resource for another call.

&gt; When a violent pro-Israel group attacked the encampment with weapons, hospitalizing multiple students, UCLA ~~did nothing for hours~~ **was unprepared to respond appropriately**.

Does it suck that the university had no effective response available when counterprotesters from off-campus assaulted the protesting students? Absolutely.

1cqkv7x,l3vkb8h,brickyardjimmy,"Regarding the police. If the police had been more active, they might have shut down the encampment before it really established itself but, I think, there must have been a policy decision to not interfere. 

  
Once that policy decision was made, I think it would have looked like bias had they interfered with counter-protests. 

  
Both the police and the administration at UCLA were in unenviable positions with respect to student protests. They wanted to appear neutral. They tried not to respond to the encampment with a heavy hand. But no matter what, someone was going to complain about how they acted.

  
Ultimately, my basic problem is that this particular conflict isn't as one sided as either side would have you believe. It's complex, obviously. It's been going on for a very long time and both Israel and Palestine have intentionally contributed to the propagation of the conflict.

Actually, what that shows is a first hand account of trying to use smallpox as a biological weapon. 

That certainly isn't the only method that was used to kill natives though, as the American Indian wars can contest.

I'm sure it's just a coincidence that settler colonial projects always seem to be justified because they are bringing enlightenment to the savages.

It's a *single* record of someone discussing a plan to use smallpox as a biological weapon.

Should we talk about all the methods Native Americans used to kill enemies, whether they were fellow natives or settlers? Here are a few (https://smokymountainnews.com/archives/item/6413-different-tribes-treated-captives-differently). This is much more exhaustive. (https://epublications.marquette.edu/dissertations\_mu/174/).

&gt;I'm sure it's just a coincidence that settler colonial projects always seem to be justified because they are bringing enlightenment to the savages.

In their time, yes. They were the progressives of their day. Think about that.

But you should truly take a hard look at what the Aztecs were doing. The current trend to view settling and colonizing far off lands in binary terms as 100% bad -- or even a net bad -- is wrongheaded. And don't get me started on ""cultural appropriation.""

Broken treaties, massacres and atrocities aren't okay. Other things that occurred were simply the sad effects of two sides battling for control, and the smaller, weaker, less advanced one lost. It's a story as old as time and a dynamic that surely played out in the Americas over and over again long before the Europeans arrived on its shores. It was an inevitability that the Native American way of life would come to an end. All those different languages and dialects weren't going to survive.  Some of the customs survive.

so critics of divestment would have to argue &amp; prove that the divestment is discriminatory in nature (is it antisemitic, or just anti-zionist / anti-war, as those are not all protected classes).

without this specificity, anti-bds laws would be ironic in nature, as government sanctions clearly operate in the same manner, but at an even higher level, than these calls for divestment would.

considering most of the divesting would revolve around non-israeli/jewish entities to begin with, i don‚Äôt immediately see how one could prove these divestments are discriminatory, but i would not be shocked to see set precedents that can be used to argue for either side. plus i‚Äôm just some guy.

1ccx2k1,l19d1dh,InTheMorning_Nightss,"You forego it because *every* battle is different, so tactics are different.

Israel and Palestine's history goes back to the early 19th century.  To act like it's America's responsibility to tackle a historical problem that the vast majority of Americans don't feel or even comprehend is a *big* imposition to place on others.

Notice also in your list for America, they're all *domestic* issues with obviously African American Civil Rights being the biggest one.  Julius sip-in was fixated on very specific state laws.  The civil disobedience was done so that they could be officially denied to then challenge the law in court by escalating to the NY State Supreme Court.

Regarding Snowden, his actions may generally qualify broadly as ""civil disobedience,"" but definitely not in any traditional or compelling way.  This is something I was closely plugged into ([here's](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/edward-snowden-national-security-whistleblowing-and-civil-disobedience) a good read on it).

And while it does impact ""many"" directly, it absolutely does not directly impact the vast majority of US citizens.  My point isn't to say it doesn't *matter* to anyone here.  But the point is that it needs an impact at scale, which things like Civil Rights for African Americans did have.  

There comes a point where Civil Disobedience will create more adversaries when unimpacted citizens start to be impacted by the *protestors,* thus making them be *angry* at the protestors instead of the cause.  If you block the freeway thus preventing someone from getting to a doctor's appointment or work, they won't walk away and say, ""Wow, fuck Israel for that.""

It‚Äôs not a fight. It‚Äôs not a debate. It‚Äôs the reality on the ground. IDF is targeting civilians, you can watch the news in Hebrew and they openly talk about this proudly. This is why many Jewish students are against this.

1ccx2k1,l1askjq,Seraph199,"""Land conflict""

Israel has all the power and always has. All the money, the weapons, the control over supply lines, massive support from the most powerful economy and military-industrial complex in the world. Veto power preventing the UN from even looking closer into their actions. 

Failing to understand the balance of power here and why Israel is labeled the terrorist oppressor is serious. Hamas are also terrorists, they are wrong in their actions, but they are also a weaker organization voted into power by people who have almost all been slaughtered. The only way you can hold your stance is if you have completely dehumanized the Palestinians and why some among them join Hamas. All it takes is the empathy, taking the perspectives of the people in this situation, listening to both sides. Listening to the victims on both sides.

The hostages families are among those protesting Netanyahu's home, demanding a ceasefire and end to the violence. The power is entirely in Israel's hands. And Netanyahu has announced he will continue assaulting the Palestinians no matter what. His words.

As Jews, we aren't usually segregated here.  We are, however, oppressed.  This isn't the same kind of oppression, that fueled the civil rights movement leading to, and through Jim Crow.  I guess not everyone is able to separate these two things.

The Senate faculty authorized the Legislative Assembly to vote on two resolutions yesterday: no-confidence in Chancellor Block, and censure for Chancellor Block. There were a number of issues that call into question the integrity of the process, including a filibuster on 5/10 and the postponement of the vote until last night, 5/16. The staff of the Senate are saying it will take up to 10 days to count the votes (which is absurd because voting was electronic). 

The lecturers' and librarians' union, UC-AFT, is also having a vote of no-confidence. All members of the union can participate in the vote. The voting period goes through Monday, 5/20 at 11:59 PM.

Keep in mind that both of these votes are just symbolic. Even if one or both succeed, Chancellor Block would not be under any obligation to step down. What matters more IMO is the scope of the graduate student strike that is likely going to occur; whether other unions besides UAW 4811 also go on strike at the same time; and the extent to which Senate faculty (who are not unionized) support or join a strike.",9,1715976444.0,t1_l4eyzh2

Thanks for taking a stand against the attack on the encampment and for the Palestinian people.

Genuinely curious tho why you think that the encampment is a viable way to protest tho (doesn‚Äôt mean they should have been attacked). There needs to be content neutral rules on protests, and this seems unsustainable. What if a Zionist group took over Janns and didn‚Äôt let any pro-Palestinian students on Janns?

Trying to engage in good faith and hope you respond with that as well. Thanks :)",17,1715902510.0,t3_1ctepn9
1ctepn9,l4e7g8d,[deleted],"That's a good question! I don't think the movement restrictions imposed by the campus security and protestors were a good idea. However, after reading more I realized that the students were coming under attack from ""counter-protestors"" starting on Day One, and I think there was a cynical strategy at work here:

1) ""Zionists"" harassed protestors (I put that in quotation marks bc it seems like some of the attackers were not Zionists at all)

2) Protestors felt unsafe so they started trying to restrict who could enter Dickson Plaza

3) ""Zionists"" threw fits (on camera) about restrictions on movement, claiming they are being discriminated against

4) claims of discrimination by protestors were used to incite violence

I think the university would have been in the right to tell protestors they cannot restrict movement of students or employees through Dickson Plaza (while also doing a better job of protecting the protestors). Instead, they declared the whole encampment ""unauthorized"" and ""unlawful"" and sent in a battalion of police.",14,1715909868.0,t1_l4dq0ub
1ctepn9,l4irnq8,nameOfTheWind1,"Thanks for the response. I do agree it was practically a tough situation for the encampment due to potential attacks, although I think the correct response would have been to protest another way instead of ‚Äúbeefing up‚Äù the perimeter.

I guess I think ur being a bit charitable about what it meant for the university to tel the protesters what to do. They weren‚Äôt listening to anything at all. The only two options were let them do whatever they wanted (which while peaceful, I dont think shouldn‚Äôt really be allowed) or clear them. 

I do think tho that the university should have done much more to protect them and it‚Äôs shameful how long police took to respond the night of the attack.",2,1715984520.0,t1_l4e7g8d

1ctepn9,l4hftxl,Prestigious_Bill_220,"I don‚Äôt understand something. If people don‚Äôt think that this was other students (as I believe seems to be the consensus) then why are they not acknowledging that the encampments posed a security threat to students? THEY ARE STUDENTS! Their encampment attracted violence. Schools everywhere tried to get the protestors to comply with restrictions that would keep EVERYONE safe. Not just Jewish students but also the students in the encampment who clearly felt no reason to be scared. The students claiming to be scared prior to this were not respected. The encampment continued, illegally. The school tried to prevent interference and it backfired because when the violence actually happened they weren‚Äôt ready to handle it.

The violence was wrong. Nobody disagrees with that. The disagreement is whose fault that is. It‚Äôs the school‚Äôs fault and the protesters fault as it is also, more so, the counter ‚Äòagitators.‚Äô

The universities accurately predicted such violence. The Jewish students who are largely actually  more educated about this conflict than many of their peers in the encampment are viscerally aware of the violence that comes with both ‚Äòsides‚Äô of the conflict and rightfully had every reason to be afraid.

Nobody listened to them. It got out of hand. People got hurt. What is the shock? Maybe like, modify your behavior mildly so that it‚Äôs not violating rules (time place and manner) and the school wouldn‚Äôt ban it. Maybe once you‚Äôre advised you‚Äôre breaking the law and subject to arrest you should change your actions. Then, maybe, the police and the university wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with 150 psychopathic outsiders assaulting their students and resulting in injuries to so many of them.

The students here are not wrong to protest but their brainwashed, whitewashed, American understanding of this conflict is so unbelievably naive. Everyone who was worried for their safety before this was far more worried about incidents like this, or assaults on them from outsiders, than that of most of their student peers.

Unfortunately, most of the college encampments refused to show their IDs making it such that nobody could guarantee that non affiliated people came to use their ‚Äòpeaceful protest‚Äô as an easy target for political violence. THIS is why the encampments are a safety issue. This is why it should have been disbanded BEFORE this happened.",7,1715966967.0,t3_1ctepn9
1ctepn9,l4m9mld,[deleted],"Students should be able to protest - and even say unpopular, offensive things - without being afraid of mob violence or police repression. This is what the First Amendment is meant to protect. If protestors were making real threats of violence against Jews, then police repression would be legitimate, but that's not what happened at UCLA. Even if protestors were threatening to inflict harm on Jews (which they were not), police still shouldn't be using means that are illegal (https://calmatters.org/justice/2024/05/ucla-protest-palestine-police/). 

""Their encampment attracted violence"" is an example of victim-blaming. It is outrageous to say that peaceful student protestors are responsible for the violence inflicted on them by outsiders. 

The claim that ""...students in the encampment...clearly felt no reason to be scared"" is a false claim. The encampment protestors were being harrassed from day one. For instance, someone threw a bag of mice into the encampment. Another example: I had students tell me that people shouted racist slurs and phrases at them, like ""Go back to your master"" shouted to Black students. Then there was the actual violence directed at them - fireworks shot into the encampment, students hit with bear spray, protestors beaten while police do nothing, etc.  The protestors definitely had a reason to be afraid, and those who remained in the encampment despite the harassment and violence were brave.

I recognize that some Jewish students were scared of the encampment. However, a big reason for their fear was the constant stream of lies about the encampment - false claims of discrimination against Jews, allegations that there were swastikas in the encampment, etc. Furthermore, this narrative of ""Jews vs protestors"" completely ignores Jewish support for, and participation in, the encampment. The administration tells us that it cares about Jewish students, but it has done very little to protect Jewish students from a violent mob that contained known white nationalists and antisemites!

Lastly, UCLA is a campus open to the public. The protestors could not have prevented outsiders from coming to campus, and neither can UCPD (unless those individuals break rules or laws). Perhaps protestors could/should have limited access to the encampment itself to people with UCLA IDs, but that would not have stopped the violent mob attack against them on 4-30.",6,1716049491.0,t1_l4hftxl

1ctepn9,l4uz8n9,Prestigious_Bill_220,"It‚Äôs not ‚Äúvictim blaming‚Äù UCLA has an obligation to protect its students. Even on an open campus, the school is completely free to close it and this is not unconstitutional or illegal. 

What I‚Äôm not saying is that it‚Äôs about the Jewish students feeling scared. That is a different issue. What I meant/said was that, aside from all of the things about people‚Äôs feelings; many Jewish people deeply understand exactly how strongly many people feel and I think that‚Äôs actually underestimated by many of these protesters. The school should have protected the protesters and the other students. 

Schools have rules. Sure, GOP politicians are abusing the situation. But one thing they are not wrong about is that the constitution very specifically allows for restrictions on gatherings, whether it‚Äôs in a private space or a public forum. The exceptions can be for a multitude of reasons but largely for reasons relating to safety and disorder. Time, place, and manner restrictions are real and based on very well precedented constitutional law. 

The protesters are not the victims as a general sentiment of the protests. They are victims of whatever violence arose. But the school‚Äôs citing safety reasons to break up protests isn‚Äôt some kind of a joke. 

Things like what happened were VERY predictable and I‚Äôm very surprised it didn‚Äôt happen sooner. If the school can‚Äôt protect them, or the police aren‚Äôt quite offering the support they ask for, or they have information about either internal or external threats that perhaps the students don‚Äôt actually know about‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ requesting the encampments to be disbanded is about the only thing that they can do. 

In another aside, as much as it‚Äôs about protecting all students, yes it was it was also about preventing the extremely hostile environment for Jewish students &amp; that is 100% valid. Anyone who refuses to acknowledge that is holding an antisemitic prejudice about it. That some Jewish students are comfortable there is entirely irrelevant. ‚ÄúI have a Jewish friend and plenty of Jews are here too.‚Äù 

Well, some Jews, For VALID reasons, such as ones specific to family origin or nationality, at minimum they have experienced many extreme moments of xenophobia for their connection to Israel. This is undeniable to any Israeli person. The requests being made would drastically alter Jewish life on campus and that isn‚Äôt okay.

To me the fact that instead of caring about that or even being open hearing these concerns, as people would clearly rather write off amy Jewish student feeling uncomfortable as ‚Äúboo hoo conservatives and evil Zionists trying to shut people up.‚Äù Largely, no. There were legit reasons to be scared from anyone. What happened was NOT unpredictable. Whoever‚Äôs fault it is, predictable violence occurred after the school tried to prevent it without police interference as demanded by the protesters, and then they lost control of the situation leading to violence.

Perhaps instead of feeling so threatened about their first amendment rights, the protest at large should have considered the danger. Sure, they have a right to endanger themselves. Isn‚Äôt that something that is a point of activism? Putting your physical and legal safety on the line to show your convictions? 

They absolutely have no right to do things that blatantly attract violence to campus where 95% of other students are completely uninvolved in their actions. If they were or weren‚Äôt scared in there, then fine. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúvictim blaming‚Äù to state an objective fact: that this violence was predictable and could have been prevented. That ALL students were failed, and the disrespect of these students for the concern of the rest makes people feel a whole lot less bad about what happened.

For most outside perspectives from the encampments, from everyone I‚Äôve spoken to, did not have much of an effect on advocating for Palestine. Contrary to the apparent popular belief in the encampments, most other people are already aware of and appalled about what‚Äôs happening in Gaza. All of the headlines were about campus protests and very few of them were about Gaza for weeks. That was not the case before the protests started becoming threatening to public safety. It‚Äôs not surprising that most people found this so petulant and performative.

Unless and until you see a press release from the DoJ or the FBI announcing a credible FEDERAL criminal (hate crimes) investigation is under way then you can be sure it is not happening.

The assaults on 4/30 appear to be federal hate crimes to me. Not so much because of who they targeted, but because of the affiliations, previous actions of, messaging and racist sentiments of the attackers.  Where is the federal investigation?  It does not exist. Period. Prove me wrong, you cannot.  There's always a press release announcing the scope and the time frame if one haas begun.  It has not.

Don't ""be sure"" of the sincerity of the only investigation that has now had 17 days to proceed and has yet to issue a single arrest warrant, search warrant, or provide any update to the press, the public or the parents of students or to the students or faculty.

This we know: Abandon you to a mob, and put out meaningless statements while stalling and re-arranging the chain of command, and tell you they are investigating themselves. That is all.

1ctepn9,l4i2ts6,Jean_dodge67,"&gt; Yup, ""wait for the investigation"" feels like a stalling tactic. It's very reminiscent of January 6.

To me this is closer to what we saw in Uvalde, Texas when law enforcement failed to stop a different attack on students from a similar extended period of time.  And it's notable that Rick Braziel has been brought in as the new ""security czar"" because Brazil belongs to the professional class of cop fixers who were brought in to cover up the situation in Uvalde, too.  Braziel was part of the DOs COPS office ""critical incident review"" that VERY SLOWLY produced a blue-ribbon 600 page paper that took over 600 days to finish.  All the while the public, press and parents were denied basic answers and kept from seeing the public records and public recordings from the mass shooting failed response.  To date, all of the videos you have ever seen of Uvalde's massive law enforcement response - a travesty of cowardice chaos and confusion on all levels - was leaked, not released by authorities.  No one has resigned admitting any fault, and if you look closely, no one has actually been fired for their actions that day, either.  Next week we will witness the two-year mark and there has been no real transparency or accountability, just a lot of position papers and slanted bullsh*t to be frank. 

The same playbook is happening here, with the 21CP ""review"" being commissioned by some overpaid slow-as-molasses consultants who are ""looking into"" how the cops failed on 4/30.  They are a screen to place between the real answers and records and the people who deserve answers and public records now.  We should already have UCLA PD bodycam and LAPD bodycam and dash cam made public that recorded and thus time stamped all the communications that will help put together the real picture of who told whom to stand-down while students were being assaulted for four horrific hours. You cannot trust the people who failed to be the same people who determine how the failures happened.  It's so basic, yet thus far every entity working on anything reports directly to Gene Block.  HE FAILED.  Why is he in charge of anything?

And don't be fooled into forcing him to retire early.  He and all involved need to be on some sort of seriously enforced suspension while we await real answers.  beck and Towers, too.  Do not let them slink away, you will never get answers that way.  Hold up their pay and job and pension and isolate them under a microscope.  When 25-30 students go to the hospital because the very people most directly responsible for not only safety but our sacred, mission-objective academic freedom, freedom of speech and assembly are left to clear their own names with paid consultants helping them shield the public records from the public, who paid for them own them and have every right to see them, we call that open corruption of the lowest sort. Do not let them get away with this, do not stand around and let them run the whole show.  

We've seen this show in Uvalde. It's not pretty. What you will find is that it's worse than you imagined, they knew it all along and hid it all from you.  And there is more they are still hiding that you will probably never know.  That's the ONLY consistent pattern to how Uvalde played out.

Instead, it really seemed like the security guards and officers at UCLA were SUPPORTING the mob violence against protestors, standing by while it happened and then refusing to arrest anyone even when they broke up the fight. 

I don't think there's any formal mechanism for the faculty or staff to suspend Block. I wish there was. From what I know, even the Academic Senate no-confidence vote is just symbolic - a yes vote doesn't require Block to step down. This system is not remotely democratic. UCOP might be able to suspend or fire Block, although I get the sense that UCOP either approved of or pushed for the crack down on the encampment.",4,1715975728.0,t1_l4i2ts6
1ctepn9,l4iinxv,Jean_dodge67,"Yes like Uvalde, a horrific travesty of public safety pulls the lid off of who holds power here.  Slowly over time the people whose job it is to repaint the dorms in summer became unaccountable power-brokers who stripped the students and faculty of their rightful place at the head of the ship.  The mission of a university isn't to enshrine the power of the administration.  It's academic freedom that matters.   

Is UCLA a university or is it a hedge fund with a furry mascot in a suit?  Sadly, ""mission creep"" ossifies institutions great and not-so-great until the main purpose is to remain an institution first, and the real mission becomes secondary, subservient.  A university is a place to ensure academic freedom, or else it's nothing at all.   

I agree that when the UCLA police FLED, and when they stood by and did nothing to intervene they were actively encouraging the violent mob to greater levels of mayhem and destruction.  These 4/30 thugs chanted ""USA USA"" as though their offensive linebackers were taking the field when more cops arrived and stood dithering on the sidelines. 

The frustrating aspect of the current situation IMO is that the faculty should have had the power and the foresight to force the protesters and the administration to the negotiating table long before things got this out of hand.  Ultimately there needed to be a lot more like you, and a lot less faculty who stood on the sidelines while students were left unprotected.  

Researchers, instructors, professors and all faculty need to act with solidarity with ALL students, even the ""I just want to buy a diploma and visit the gift shop on my way out"" crowd, to make it understood that a university is the scholars and professors first, and the administration last in the power position.  This is why protest often takes radical and disruptive forms, it's attempting to right some very entrenched wrongs and call to alarmingly unjust situations, not just genocide in Gaza but also to how the university is running off the rails altogether.  If all that happens at a college is that the status quo is maintained and the hedge fund is added to, then that's not a university.  

I fully realize Block and his gang WILL get away with this.  There won't be justice, transparency or accountability for the attacks on 4/30.  That doesn't mean the full picture can't be shown in all its corrupt malfeasance.  And we have the bulwark of the 4th estate to look to as well.  I hope some students are making this event a serious case study for future academics. 

In the meantime, I encourage all to recognize our common humanity, for students and faculty to show solidarity, to hold administration to account by demanding for transparency,  and to call out rank corruption where it stands.",1,1715980943.0,t1_l4i4kb0
1ctepn9,l4iqdp0,[deleted],"In fairness to my colleagues, it appeared at first that UCLA was going to take a tolerant approach towards the encampment. Some of us were concerned that students were not being protected enough from harassment. However, the general sentiment was one of reassurance - reassurance that UCLA would not make the same mistakes as Columbia University (and others). 

The encampment was up for only six days before Block announced it was ""unauthorized"", so there was not much time for faculty and staff to mobilize while the encampment was present. As soon as Block announced it was ""unauthorized"" (signalling some sort of repression to come), faculty and staff mobilized, writing that letter I linked to above (https://sites.google.com/view/nopoliceactions).

Yes, the response from all interest groups could/should be quicker. However, I've never seen faculty and staff so unified, organized, or mobilized before. I'm more optimistic than you are on this. I think there's a better than even chance that Block, Drake, and others will face consequences for their decisions (and inactions).",1,1715983999.0,t1_l4iinxv
1ctepn9,l4hu0kg,Jean_dodge67,"The only thing that the administration can provide now to regain the loss of public trust from the students and faculty is transparency, and that's the last thing they are doing. 

A university is a place established to enshrine, foster and protect academic freedom for scholars, researchers and professors.  The ""administration"" should be the people who repair the leaky roof, stock the lab with fresh test tubes and such, milk the cows and run the mess hall, paint the dorms and build handicap ramps, and yes, ensure the vital freedom and basic safety are maintained.  Not wield the power to turn off the freedom and safety like a spigot.  

And don't count on the media to every say the authorities are corrupt, even when they clearly are.  We can prod them to do more investigative journalism, but they will only go so far.  What is needed is that there be full transparency and answers given up front to anyone who asks.  Gene Block has yet to hold a single press conference.  He's hiding, slanting, spinning and probably lying but we need to know where and how he's hiding the truth about failing the students and exposing them to a sustained violent mob attack.   

The administrators of just about every college in the nation have lost the public trust and shattered their institutional credibility over Palestine-releated protests and how they have been brutally mishandled on campus after campus. 

Now, sorry to dig at your group but why were the faculty unable or unwilling to force the administration to sit down at the negotiation table with the students here?  Wasn't that their role?  I get the feeling the Academic Senate vote of Gene Block's censoring and no confidence was filibustered?  Transparency works all ways.  We need better communication coming out of the faculty side to all this.  Why are there not letters asking for a federal hate crimes investigation into the mob attacks on students?  Where can the students expect the faculty to align with their cause of academic freedoms?  You seem like ""one of the good ones"" but how isolated are you, how much support do you have from fellow professors, instructors, etc?  Don't just tell us your sentiments, tell us what you think is happening here behind the scenes.  You should have greater insights.  Who is ""driving the bus"" here?  And where is it going?",2,1715971954.0,t1_l4hrce8
1ctepn9,l4i0ex6,[deleted],"Remember, I'm a lecturer, so my impressions about what ""Senate faculty"" are up to are not necessarily accurate. Nonetheless, I do have some info I can share.

First, one barrier to collective action is that UCLA Senate faculty are not unionized and have a weak faculty association. Lectures, OTOH, are unionized, but our union (UC-AFT) is not very strong. UC-AFT is looking into next steps, but moving slowly (too slowly, IMO).

Another barrier is that some (or maybe many) faculty do not have an accurate understanding of what actually transpired on 4/30 - 5/2. Faculty are susceptible to disinformation, too. I heard second-hand that some of the statements made in the Academic Senate yesterday were inaccurate and/or offensive. 

Nonetheless, there is currently a group of 900 UCLA faculty and staff who are demanding:

1) that Chancellor Block resigns

2) UCLA grants amnesty to peaceful protestors, and

3) that UCLA fully discloses its investments and divests from military weapons companies. 

You can find the list of signatories, and other information, at https://sites.google.com/view/we-stand. This same group of faculty also released a letter on May 1 with six demands, including asking the administration to engage in sincere talks with the protestors (https://sites.google.com/view/nopoliceactions). Most of those demands were disregarded by the administration. 

Yes, I have also heard there was a filibuster in Academic Senate on Friday, 5/10 (although did not witness it firsthand because lecturers are completely excluded from Academic Senate). There were also either misinterpretations (or deliberate misreadings) of the parliamentary rules. A Daily Bruin article even suggests that vote-counting may have been botched or rigged - that faculty had enough votes to end debate, but the secretary claimed they did not (https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/09/ucla-academic-senate-to-decide-on-censure-of-no-confidence-vote-in-gene-block). 

Yesterday Academic Senate met again, and this time did manage to authorize the Legislative Assembly to vote on two resolutions: no-confidence and censure. The Senate staff are claiming that it will take up to 10 days for the votes to be counted, even though the voting was electronic. IMO, the whole process is a sham.

Lastly, I don't think anyone - including the administration - is ""driving the bus here."" Different groups are organizing separately and not necessarily coordinating with one another. Since Senate faculty are not unionized, some of them have been waiting for the unions to make decisions about striking before deciding on their own course of action. Nonetheless, I think it's entirely possible that we will see a general strike this quarter at UCLA - a strike that starts with grad students but then spreads to faculty and staff, and basically shuts down the university.",3,1715974230.0,t1_l4hu0kg

Yes, I know U.S. police don't have a legal obligation to intervene (which I think is bullshit). However, there's this thing called being a good human being. If I had been there that night I would've tried to stop the violence, even though I have no training and I would have been putting my own life at risk. (The reason I didn't go was because the protestors asked people not to come.) 

Regarding policing: I understand it must be difficult as an officer to protect people whom you may disagree with and whom might even hate you. However, by acting like this - not protecting people from violence, then brutally repressing peaceful protest - they are shredding their own legitimacy and pushing even more people into the ""abolish the police"" camp. It seems to me that police agencies since 2020 have had a counterproductive response to criticism.

Don't ""be sure"" of the sincerity of the only investigation that has now had 17 days to proceed and has yet to issue a single arrest warrant, search warrant, or provide any update to the press, the public or the parents of students or to the students or faculty.

1ctepn9,l4epvrg,JohnVidale,"Carry on shouting that all the degradation of the functions of the universities have nothing to do with the protests.

At the UW ""We have engaged sincerely and openly. The representatives of the encampment have presented a series of changing and escalating demands, including most recently demanding the creation of a new department that would have an ‚Äúanti-Zionist‚Äù litmus test for faculty hiring; granting a student group oversight of awarding new, religion-based University scholarships; and a blanket amnesty for all violations of the law and student code, including not solely camping, among other demands. Many of these demands, especially the most recent, are contrary to academic freedom and/or to state or federal law.""

In the pending strike, these are the demands

*  Amnesty for all academic employees, students, student groups, faculty, and staff who face disciplinary action or arrest due to protest.
* Protecting the right to free speech and political expression on campus.  
* Divestment from UC‚Äôs known investments in weapons manufacturers, military contractors, and companies profiting from Israel‚Äôs war on Gaza. 
* Disclosure of all funding sources and investments, including contracts, grants, gifts, and investments, through a publicly available, publicly accessible, and up-to-date database.
* Empowering researchers to opt out from funding sources tied to the military or oppression of Palestinians. The UC must provide centralized transitional funding to workers whose funding is tied to the military or foundations that support Palestinian oppression.

The demands will never end, the actual students will eventually tire of the histrionics.  The protests already garnered international attention, which I thought was fine, Gaza is an outrage, but after a couple weeks, some people actually have real jobs to do that are being compromised, and get irritated.",0,1715918167.0,t1_l4eopuc

Of course this doesn‚Äôt include all protesters, the majority probably are people that genuinely are mainly there because cause they care about Palestine.

1cyy0sm,l5dx9n2,[deleted],I'm so honored that a letter I helped write - from UCLA Jewish faculty and staff - was entered into the congressional record.,14,1716501344.0,t3_1cyy0sm
1cyy0sm,l5eieif,greens3,"Professor Speer, I was one of the first students you had as a sociology professor on campus. When the sociology department reached out to me a few years back asking me to recommend you for an official faculty position, I did without question because I know you‚Äôre a great professor.

However, something that I‚Äôve noticed is that those who call themselves ‚ÄúJews for Palestine‚Äù while also ignoring the absolute terror Israelis have had to endure are not middle eastern/Mizrachi Jews. White passing Ashkenazi Jews like yourself are privileged enough to ignore the strife that middle eastern/Mizrachi have had to endure in the Middle East even far before the creation of Israel. For example, my grandparents lived in a country/world in which they were legally not allowed to go outside while it rained because Jews were considered dirty and the government at the time was fearful that Jews would contaminate the water system. Jews were given a Jizya (non-Muslim) tax. And within the last 70 years, Middle Eastern Jews were actually ethnically cleansed from every other middle eastern country except for Israel. My own parents escaped to this country as refugees while a portion of their family were not given visas and were only given the option to escape to Israel. 

I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt be critical of Israel. You should. Even Israeli‚Äôs are being critical of the government‚Äôs actions right now and have been trying to oust Netanyahu for years (3 elections in 4 years). At the end of day, Palestinians and Israelis are two sides of the same coin being abused by people in power for their own political/financial gains. They should both have a country in which they feel like they belong and can live their lives without a constant fear of attack. 

However, if your stance is that Israel does not have a right to exist and that the entire country of Israel should become a Muslim country, please understand that your white privilege allows you to ignore the struggles of middle eastern Jews. Within the Jewish community, there is a long history of Ashkenazi Jews being racist towards Mizrachi Jews and of Ashkenazi Jews thinking they know better than Mizrachi Jews about their own experience. Please don‚Äôt fall into the same pattern. I know you‚Äôre a far better person than that.",5,1716510249.0,t1_l5dx9n2
1cyy0sm,l5el8fd,[deleted],"Hi there! I'm very glad to be hearing from a former student, and hope you are doing well. I appreciate your support for my promotion to continuing lecturer! If you are curious to read the letter I helped write, you can view it here: https://sites.google.com/view/ucla-jewish-faculty-staff/. 

Keep in mind everything I say below is my personal view. I'm not a spokesperson for any organizations, including the group of Jewish faculty and staff that signed the letter.

I think that - as long as we are living in a world of nation-states - *Jews have a right to a national homeland.* Some people might even consider me a ""Zionist"" for this reason. I do not think Israel should be ""wiped off the map."" I think the analogy that some leftwingers draw to the decolonial struggles in Africa, like Algeria, makes no sense. You're right, *for many/most Israeli Jews there's no ""home country"" to go back to*, because it's not safe in their ancestral countries of origin. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is related to colonialism, but it is false to reduce it to just that. It's also about two peoples with competing narratives and claims to the land.

Furthermore, I do not think it is even remotely possible that Israel could be destroyed and for Israeli Jews to be expelled from the territory. Israel has nuclear weapons, after all. I also don't think a one-state solution is achievable in the medium-term, although perhaps in a distant future. In my view, the only viable solution in the medium-term is a two-state one, where both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs have a state that represents and protects them. 

I hope this clears up where I stand on this issue. It sounds like we actually agree for the most part (or even completely)!",15,1716511477.0,t1_l5eieif

1cyy0sm,l5fc9hy,Jean_dodge67,"LA county jail door slams on the first 4/30 mob vigilante thug, white-faced masked counter protester, 18 year old Edan On of Beverly Hills High school. Early reports on twitter are saying On was arrested and booked on felony suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. $30,000 bail set, not yet secured. In LA county jail custody and booked into the system (which takes time) by 8pm local time.  I cannot confirm it but it's looking to be a legit report. A CNN reporter posted it.  Not sure how they knew to look but I can make some guesses. 

I wonder if Gene Block had any involvement in the timing of this arrest happening after his appearance before congress this morning.  It may not have played well to the GOP chair to see it happen yesterday.  All of this is so performative and about ""optics"" and Gene Block is clearly being coached by consultants as how to handle his current state of infamy.  

I doubt we could ever know but something tells me to harbor suspicion that this thug wasn't hard to find, and that me may have even surrendered with his lawyer and bail bondsman right behind him, on a prearranged schedule.

Also, as a stateless middle easterner who‚Äôs been protesting for palestine since the early 2010s, I promise you I‚Äôm not on the wrong side of history.

Also I feel like a shit ton of ppl have just recently gained ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù on the palestinian struggle. And while I appreciate the increased sentiment for Palestinians, at UCLA at least it seems like a decent portion of these ppl are a) either just virtue signalling and/or b) behaving in a way that is painting the Palestinian movement in the wrong light and is pushing ppl (esp the significant ones we are trying to sway) away from the movement. It sort of reminds me of the BLM protests (which did do a decent positive impact but not incredible shifts). I‚Äôm just wondering whether this will be the same. 2 yrs from now, even if colleges divest &amp; if Israel even ever stops doing their current abhorrent acts, will Israel just return to continuing their systematic oppression of Palestinians just in another way?

1cngzrs,l3914mv,Jimnophoria,"re: the edited in last paragraph. yeah. this has been the first movement to truly radicalize me (coming from a very white privileged background despite low income) and all I knew about Palestine/even the middle east in general prior to the SJP teach in way back in October was really just some vague memory of a scary video of Gaza in my social studies class freshman year of high school. it's wild how ignorant I am still on the topic broadly (I know really nothing about the history aside from bits and pieces from Instagram) and on manyyy other important social topics. but I've been learning in the process and growing through it, and I think that's the case for others too.

society will of course keep going even if the movement is a full on success and people will return to their individual lives (and then Israel might do as you say..), but social movements are a slow-moving thing that build consciousness and eventually bring about change. the US is a wild and oppressive place yet we've still seen significant progress in combatting racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, and more through social movements. and part of that is the education that comes through these movements, awareness of the common humanity of others, etc. that isn't easily forgotten. I'm also cynical but I think coalition building and protest have worked in the past and will continue to work into the future. even the students virtue signalling are taking part in historical protests (that is, if they are), learning about the issue themselves, and spreading the word -- which is still important, even if the intentions aren't great.

1cngzrs,l3c8ym3,Jimnophoria,"Apologies, didn't see this comment. Reddit mobile is strange. I appreciate the links. I'm certainly in an echochamber for the most part. That first video looks horrible. The second one.. she seems fine. The third one -- really bad, I'm glad she got detained. That fourth video -- all they did was block his video, and they said he was being violent earlier, so I think they're justified. Doesn't seem like there was any violence there. And yes, they were resisting the police. Of course they were. That's what a resistance movement is. 

Point is, the vast majority of protestors were peaceful and responding to counterprotestor violence if they were violent. There are one or two exceptions you've shown, but that doesn't mean that the whole of the movement was violent. Every social movement has some people who act out in ways not desirable because they were angry. Many (at least 20 iirc) protestors were injured and had to be taken to the hospital because of counterprotestors or cops. That's crazy to me. They should be guaranteed protection of the cops from fights (as it seems the man in the third video had), and should not have force used against them to remove them from protest.

This isn't to compare too much. Violence is horrible regardless. It's just that one side is almost entirely peaceful, trying not to engage with counter protestors, and protesting for a free Palestine that is actively being bombed and has been under occupation for 75 years, while the other is attempting to agitate and annoy those protestors, sometimes violently, while advocating for the colonizers.",2,1715289074.0,t1_l3b7t17

1cngzrs,l3chnps,Skullybnz,"The pro-Palestinian protesters illegally blocked off sections of campus and would only let people determined to be idelogically aligned. Eventually(?), a wristband system was established. To get one, you needed someone in the camp to vouch for you. Then you'd have to fill out a google doc, pledging that you supported the goals of the encampment -- a loyalty oath.  The wristband described in [this video](https://twitter.com/social_brains/status/1788397547696034240), to access Powell Library, was yellow. I recall the wristbands for the camp itself being red.

The pro-Palestinian protesters also violated the First Amendment rights of outsiders by not allowing them to record in a public place, and surounded and blocked those who recorded video  gainst their wishes, typically jostling them and committing assault and battery. They blocked the path of anyone in or outside the encampment they decided shouldn't be there. Even absent assault and battery, you're simply not allowed to purposely block people like that in a public space. It's against the law.

It's mindblowing that people have the nerve to call those who bothered people in the encampment ""agitators,"" unless you're talking about the counter prostesters'' violent instigation on 5/1, who were the greatest gift to cause.  The encampment was one giant agitation designed to produce outraged responses, from the illegal barricades with the incendiary signs to the denial of campus access and the rampant vandalism. (In truth, building of the camp itself was an act of vandalism.) Rules for thee -- including my illegal, arbitrary rules -- and not for me.

""You wrote, ""Yes, they were resisting the police. Of course they were. That's what a resistance movement is."" You can say that, but that doesn't mean it's right, smart or legal to actually do that. And you can't violently assault cops -- or anyone else -- because you think it's the right thing to do. The police showed remarkable restaint on 5/2, and virtually all of the reports of serious injury are unproven or disproven. And you say that Caballa was violent before they got violent with him. I haven't heard that before, nor seen any evidence of it.

Re: the occupation."" Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005, so there was no occupation of Gaza for 18 years prior to 10/7. (The West Bank is another matter.) Hamas has been shooting tens of thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001.",4,1715292202.0,t1_l3c9nwb
1cngzrs,l3eauof,Jimnophoria,"Yes, they only wanted people who aren't going to attack them in their encampment, so they set up a wristband people to ensure that was the case. The library (and Royce) [was accessible](https://bso.ucla.edu/news/campus-activity-updates-may-5th) through other entrances without wristbands; it was just the entrance in front of Powell/Royce where the encampment was set up that was controlled by SJP.

Assault and battery are strong words for the simple act of blocking someone's view after they break their way into an encampment. I highly doubt protestors left the encampment to block people on the outside from filming, but it also wouldn't surprise me since there have been doxxing attempts by pro-Israel groups and protestors were thus worried about protecting their identity. Perhaps they did block some cameras, but that's nothing like cops [arresting members of the press](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6pCRl0ykrg/) (photo #3) and pro-Israel students [actually attacking student press](https://www.instagram.com/p/C6mXS7xSkb0/) (photo #2... not to mention the cops here).

Yes, of course the movement was designed to disrupt and draw attention to itself. That was the point. It was very successful. It's sparked many more movements. People are outraged about Gaza. I'll get back to that. Yes, there was vandalism -- this was not condoned by all protestors, but it was there. But. It's property, it can be cleaned/repaired. UCLA has enough money from its investments in war, after all. People's lives in Gaza cannot be replaced. Social movements almost always have some parts that break the law or perhaps go a little far -- that's because it's people fighting for the morally correct thing, and it's easy to get caught up in your emotions when that's the case.

Calling [this](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/07/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-ucla-encampment-protesters-recall-april-30-attack) the ""greatest gift to the cause"" is quite disheartening to hear. I personally know people who were bear sprayed and beat up..  Which is crazy compared to some words you don't like, some damaged property, and barricades for.. self defense from that very violence. Cops were [certainly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE7QLVara8M) being [violent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3perFUMnB-I), unless you consider [rubber bullets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_bullet) perfectly safe. As for the Cabassa bit, I don't really know, that's just what the protestors said and I believe them. But maybe not. Point is protestors weren't violent either, in that video you shared.

As for Gaza...

1cngzrs,l39ifoi,Ok_Candy9193,"The Tribal Invasion of Kashmir on 22 October 1947 was a contentious and significant action, because of its serious consequences. It clearly violated the Standstill Agreement concluded between Pakistan and the Ruler of Jammu and Kashmir and resulted in death and destruction of thousands of innocent civilans in Jammu and Kashmir. From Muzaffarabad (now in POK) to Baramulla, the tribal invaders left only scenes of death, destruction and desolation. Out of 14 thousand odd population in Baramulla that time less than two thousand had remained while rest had either been killed or had left Baramulla for safer places.

The tribal invaders even raped nuns, who were performing their duties St. Joseph Hospital and School in Baramulla. They even didn‚Äôt spare doctores and para-medics. The Pashtun tribesmen had no regard for anyone. The heart-rending stories from the survivors about the atrocities committed by the tribal invaders and the looting and destruction by them still reverbate in Kashmir.

After the Timur massacre of Delhi in 1358, the massacre of Mirpur, a bustling trade centre and historic walled city of Jammu and Kashmir now in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir on 25th of November 1947 was the worst massacre of Indian history. As the offer of accession by Maharaja was accepted by Govt of India on 26th of Oct. 1947 after India and Pakistan gained independence, the ill fated Hindu and Sikh minorities living Muslim majority western areas of Jammu region and in Kashmir valley were waiting their Dooms day. The decision of accession of J&amp;K with India and its completed merger with India as its integral part was celebrated like Diwali in Mirpur with lighting of candles and bursting of crackers.

As tribal invaders were busy in killing, raping and looting, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir sought help from India, which was only made available after the accession to the Union. The Indian army landed to liberate Jammu and Kashmir from the invaders on October 27 and within a few months time, the tribals were pushed back",1,1715251942.0,t1_l38h65t

No, it's just that some people have different priorities, (i.e, going to class, getting their degree, graduating, and putting it to work.)  and that's okay.

1dd7u4u,l8j9ysv,king-k77,"Well, the entire world has a history of being racist at one point or another. The example you‚Äôre referring to happened over 30 years ago. In modern times, there‚Äôs almost never instances of racism among organizations, especially when you realize that the LAPD themselves are a diverse population consisting of blacks, whites, Hispanics, etc. Are the individual instances of racism that occur? Of course. But, when they do happen, those individuals are usually punished by both society and the justice system- as seen with the George Floyd incident which, by the way, didn‚Äôt really show any evidence of racism, just excessive force towards an individual. 

Of course, there are many factors that contribute towards increases in crime, I don‚Äôt disagree with that. But, we can identify primary variables and secondary variables. I think culture/society is a primary variable but not economics. Egypt and Morocco both suffer significantly more economically than the US, yet they‚Äôre both much safer than the US. When I say ‚Äúcriminals are running wild,‚Äù it‚Äôs an exaggerated statement meant to emphasize the tolerance typically displayed towards crime in blue states.

We will not go into the bigger conversation of what causes crime because we will be here for days. You say that there are laws that encourage crime in democratic states- but here you are encouraging kidnapping (or wrongful arrest, same thing) because someone is saying something you don‚Äôt agree with.

All you can say for sure is that 52% of those admitted to UCLA choose to go there, but only 45% of those admitted to Berkeley choose to go there. But *we don't know how those groups overlap*.

So what you can't do is use the data to prove one school is better or more desirable than the other. Seeing this poorly reasoned stats thread at the top of /r/ucla lowers my opinion of the school slightly. Although it does sound like you have hot girls to make up for being bad at statistics.

That's great on its own. It's the best in the UC system. But you can't use the data in those tabs to say ""someone admitted to both UCLA and UCSC has a 25:1 cross admit preference"". 

I am open to being wrong here, statistics is hard and even good scientists mess it up regularly.

1cqb7yo,l3vntz8,miggylifts,"Jesus, why do you keep saying UCSC? That's not even one of the schools in UCLA's top 25 destination list. Nor is it listed in the analysis, which means it's not even even possible to get cross admit numbers for from the data provided. For someone who keeps trying to point out others' supposed mistakes, you keep making very basic mistakes yourself. And then REPEATING them. You're all over the place bud lol.

The basis of your disagreement seems to be, ""Well it just *feels* wrong. It's too big. I don't believe it. My hunch tells me otherwise."" Cool, we get that. But you haven't actually provided any sources that actually show what's supposedly wrong. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Not even a mouse on a wheel.

The data shared in this thread cover one application cycle only - class of 2027 students.

And it shows you exactly how many students (got into both schools + picked at least one of them). See below. When you examine those numbers, you get the following preferences for the 2023 cycle based on students who, again, (got into both schools + picked at least one of them).


939 chose UCB; 1,914 chose UCLA  

146 chose UCSD; 3,562 chose UCLA  

98 chose UC Irvine; 2,802 chose UCLA  

87 chose UC Davis; 2,713 chose UCLA 


It's really not even hard to believe in my opinion. There are not a lot of students every year who pick UC Davis or UC Santa Cruz over UC Berkeley or UCLA, which is why there's such a big differential. It certainly didn't happen at my high school, but that's just my experience. Keep in mind there are also self-selection and safety school strategies at play. A lot of the people shooting for, and qualified, for UCLA only apply to UC Davis as a backup. And if they got into UCLA, there's a good chance they got into other prestigious schools, which would leave lower ranked UCs with thousands of empty SIR portals at the end of the cycle (yield data show this). Keep in mind the cost is roughly the same for all, save a few situations like a regents scholarship.

It just takes a couple clicks to get to it. The granular data is right there. 

This allows you to compare cross admit decisions in the manner I did. Just because you aren‚Äôt happy with the numbers, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre incorrect. You might be upset that your school  performs poorly in terms of cross admit decisions vs UCLA, but that‚Äôs not really a valid critique of the numbers.

&gt;I think part of the confusion that (for your perusual) u/Scratchlax and possibly others were having was that you needed to point out to switch the tab in your link to Top25 Enrollment Destinations and note -- i.e., in filtering by Campus selection -- and recording each of the other campuses top-25 where UCLA stood with respect to numbers in their accepted classes as well as its (UCLA's) own in relation and who chose the others individually -- as you said there's only the top-25 listed. Then one could isolate the cross-admits to two schools, UCLA and each the other UCs, and calculate the %s. The problems lies in the link that you provided always defaulting to the first tab which is Enrollment Destinations which just gives a generalized classification destination, UC, CCC, Private Selectives, etc

To insult the whole community just because you didn‚Äôt bother to dig a little deeper is just petty. I challenge you to go ahead and look at the numbers and tell me how they‚Äôre wrong.",4,1715577998.0,t1_l3t7lxf

That's not a sign you found an interesting statistic, it's a sign you made a mistake.

This does NOT mean that all of these candidates were accepted to both institutions. There is probably a substantial portion of the 3562 that did not get accepted to UCSD. That drives down the ""head-to-head yield"" rate.

What we know for sure for is: out of the 32,061 total admits to UCSD, 3,562 enrolled at UCLA, and 7,004 enrolled at UCSD.

The top-25 of UCLA's are effectively the most elite colleges in the nation, inclusive of itself of course, but includes very few of the other UCs, whereas even UCB's has more of the other UCs. Behind UCLA's most chosen destination of its accepted being itself at 6,585 enrolled at 52% yield -- which is unheard of by a public institution to have such a high yield, is UCB at 939 which is 7% of whom UCLA accepted. Of UCB's accepted, UCLA represents 1,914, which is 13% of its accepted class. This is one of the reasons why UCB has to accept \~ 2,000 more students than UCLA, with their overall yield being 45%.

In UCLA's top-25 behind UCB is USC with 339/3% and Stanford 319/3%. These 319 in the latter pretty much show up in UCB's top-25, but the 339 of USC's is expanded in all the UCs to be 2,110. If you consider that 434 of UCB's accepted chose USC, then it appears that 2,110-434 = 1,600+ most likely didn't get into UCLA and UCB, who chose to enroll at USC -- their freshman class is \~ 4,000.

1cqb7yo,l41am7a,miggylifts,"Although, you frame it in an odd way by saying ""worse."" It's actually quite true that professors who devote more time and have a greater interest in teaching rather than researching are better teachers overall. Moreover, there isn't a significant correlation between research quality and teaching ability. Consider a scenario where a professor's focus and passion are primarily on research, typically teaching only to fulfill part of their contractual obligations. This arrangement leaves less time, effort, and interest for developing their teaching skills‚Äîan observation so elementary that anyone should recognize it.

The conventional wisdom‚Äîthat the most competent professors in terms of **actual teaching quality** are found at CSUs and CA Community Colleges‚Äîsupports this notion. These institutions are fundamentally focused on teaching; their faculty's jobs, training, and professional experiences are far more geared towards pedagogical excellence. Academics who are passionate about teaching and spend decades refining their teaching techniques tend to gravitate towards these settings.

Thus, it indeed appears that 'worse' researchers can be better teachers. Even though you phrase it in that peculiar way, it underscores the point that teaching and researching are distinct disciplines traditionally bundled together at research institutions for tenured professors, which results in the dilution of the former.

The logic is applicable across various fields. It's not the profound 'gotcha' you think it is. Worse horse jockeys generally make for better football players. Conversely, worse football players might excel as horse jockeys. Worse HR directors generally make for better IT specialists. To be clear, it's not that they're superior in the latter roles because they're inept at the former; they're better because their focus and interests are narrowly tailored towards one specific area. This is called **specialization**. This naturally leads to a decrease in performance in areas they neither focus on nor desire to pursue. Remember, teaching and researching are effectively distinct disciplines, and labeling someone as 'worse' could also be labeled as 'less specialized' due to focusing predominantly on something else.

It's a fallacy to assert that being a better researcher automatically implies one will be a better teacher. That notion holds no water at any level. In fact, centuries of economic literature support the idea that specialists perform better in their focused areas.",1,1715709653.0,t1_l3vh2e5

1ct5pvf,l5g2mv1,Wotan823,"I guess the core question really is ‚Ä¶ should Israel uphold international law? Or should they just make up their own rules? My opinion is that Israel‚Äîlike all countries‚Äîshould uphold international law. 

1. Under international law (determined before Israel‚Äôs creation as a nation and which Israel has agreed to follow), any nation that is the aggressor in a war and receives land through ‚Äúconquest‚Äù is NOT granted the ‚Äúfruits of conquest,‚Äù meaning that it isn‚Äôt their land. 

2. Under international law, Israel was the aggressor that attacked Egypt preemptively in the Six Day War in 1967, thus the lands of West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem (and Golan heights too) are not recognized as legally Israel‚Äôs under international laws. I‚Äôll highlight why they did this below: 

‚Äî Prior to the 6 day war, the following nations did not have positive relations with Israel and didn‚Äôt formally recognize them as a valid nation, but rather as western colonialism: Egypt, Jordan, Syria, (and Iraq and Lebanon but these former 3 are more important). 

‚ÄîIn 1956, Egypt cut off access of Israeli vessels along water routes that are part of Egypt‚Äôs territory and sovereignty under international law. It was an asshole move on Egypt‚Äôs end and they did it because they didn‚Äôt like Israel. Israel needs access to this water for shipping goods and stuff so this made Israel big mad. They attacked Egypt over this. Israel had a stronger army and Egypt essentially reopened the maritime acccess to Israel. The United Nations got involved to make sure there was peace: Israel can have access in the water and Egypt won‚Äôt have to take a military beating. 

‚ÄîAs a result of the above, üëÜ Israel told Egypt: if you ever do that again, we‚Äôre going to consider it an act of war. However, these waterways are part of Egyptian territory and sovereignty under international law so Egypt can theoretically do whatever they want. Israel‚Äôs threats about this are baseless. They cannot tell Egypt: if you do something in your territory that hurts us, we will consider it war. This is not recognized under international law (which Israel agreed to). So, they were just ‚Ä¶ I dunno‚Ä¶ being big mad I guess. 

‚ÄîIn 1967, Egypt did cut Israel‚Äôs access to the waterway because they didn‚Äôt like Israel‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù to the water under Egypt‚Äôs territory. They felt like Israel was being a bully, basically, by telling Egypt what they ‚Äúmust‚Äù do for Israel or else they‚Äôll get attacked. 

‚ÄîPissed at the shutting of the waterway and thinking that Egypt‚Äôs mobilization of military in the Sinai (all of which are allowed actions by Egypt under international law), Israel attacked Egypt, thus being the aggressor. 

In short‚Ä¶ the ‚Äúprovocation‚Äù is not valid and thus the ensuing attack against Egypt made Israel the aggressor. This is why the United Nations have long condemned Israel‚Äôs occupation of Palestinian Territories. Hope this helps to understand the legal aspect.",1,1716541519.0,t1_l51zbj0

If you say Hamas is a terrorist organization, a membership of 40,000 people, that holds captive the 2.2 million civilians in Gaza ‚Ä¶ then Israel‚Äôs collective punishment of ALL Palestinians in Gaza is a crime against humanity under international law. Israel‚Äôs killed 36,000 Palestinians‚Ä¶ do you know how many of them were Hamas verses women, children, and civilians? You don‚Äôt know. And you know who else doesn‚Äôt know? The Israeli government. They have thus far failed to state to the international community how many civilians they have killed verses Hamas militants. This won‚Äôt bode well for their defense in the international courts. 

I don‚Äôt disagree that Hamas needs to go. It‚Äôs very clear, however, that Israel‚Äôs approach to eradicating Hamas is state-mandated genocide under international laws. This isn‚Äôt even a talking-point. Unless you study international law courses at ucla‚Äôs law school, you won‚Äôt understand or appreciate just how strong the case against Israel is. 

I predict Israel will join America in its ‚Äúvictories‚Äù like America‚Äôs stunning victories in Afghanistan and Iraq lolz. Because when has a nation ever truly been victorious against a terrorist organization? Can you name one?

We‚Äôll see what transpires. Time will tell. But the majority of the progressive population in America wants to cease all aid to Israel. Those Americans who want to sustain a blank-check support are a dying breed, boomers dying off in the next ten to fifteen years, to the point that Israel support will be of such a minority that American policies will shift dramatically in sway with the people. 

If Israel doesn‚Äôt change their policies‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre risking support and their own security. Hell, even previous Israeli prime ministers attest to such. And they‚Äôre smarter than I am about Israel‚Äôs capabilities.

1ewbeg1,lixyfhm,antoninlevin,"&gt;1) Two wrongs don't make a right

I would agree with that, but if you support Israel, you probably shouldn't.  ""Two wrongs make a right"" seems to be one of the main arguments for Israel's taking Palestine in general. 

&gt;2) You can't commit openly commit violent crimes and then expect the protection of the state when the shoe is on the other foot

Blocking a path is not a violent crime, and you're equating standing in a path to [beating people bloody and breaking bones](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs/index.html).   

Only one group committed violent crimes related to the protest, and it was the Zionists.  They planned and coordinated a violent, bloody attack.  

&gt;3) Anyone who participated in the encampment in any capacity could probably be charged with conspiracy against rights. 

""Could probably?""  You're talking about slapping charges on hundreds of people for the unsanctioned and unorganized actions of a few.  [You might as well prosecute everyone at the Charlottesville rally for murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville_car_attack).  

Well, a DA could *totally* charge them with it, but doing so would be *stupid* and a waste of time and resources.  

&gt;Which is a federal felony that carries a 10 year sentence. I'm not sure you understand just how severe of a crime the ""protesters"" committed here.

And felonious assault and attempted murder with a deadly weapon are felonies that carry far harsher sentences, for good reason.  

Let's talk some more about the [April 30 Zionist attack](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs/index.html).  How many of the counter-protesters were peaceful and didn't take part?  Do you think many of them showed up armed, late at night to...have a chat with people in the camp?  

You can't downplay the actions of the *worse* group with ""two wrongs don't make a right.""  The Zionist group committed actual felonies documented on tape, and caused grievous bodily injuries.",5,1724104263.0,t1_lixvokj
1ewbeg1,liyqcq0,magicology,"u/antoninlevin, it's clear from your comments that you‚Äôre using the term ""Zionist"" as if it were synonymous with violence and aggression. This kind of rhetoric is not only false but also dangerously misleading. Zionism is simply the belief in the Jewish right to self-determination and a homeland in Israel‚Äîsomething supported by millions around the world, including those who advocate for peace.

You‚Äôve repeatedly framed Zionists in a negative light, like when you said, **""Only one group committed violent crimes related to the protest, and it was the Zionists,""** and **""Let's talk some more about the April 30 Zionist attack.""** This narrative unfairly paints Zionists, and by extension, most Jews, as inherently violent, which is not only inaccurate but also feeds into harmful stereotypes.

Your statement, **""Why are you afraid of a hypothetical holocaust? Israel is committing one right now,""** is particularly egregious. Equating Israel's actions to a Holocaust is a gross distortion of history and deeply offensive. It diminishes the real atrocities of the Holocaust and the suffering of millions of Jews.

The article that OP posted here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1ertkjj/ucla\_cant\_allow\_protesters\_to\_block\_jewish/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1ertkjj/ucla_cant_allow_protesters_to_block_jewish/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

clearly shows the impact of such rhetoric. The federal judge ruled that UCLA cannot allow protesters to block Jewish students from accessing campus. This ruling is a direct response to the kind of hostile environment created by the demonization of Zionists/Jews. The court recognized that blocking Zionists from campus is discriminatory and unacceptable. No more blocking Zionists on college campuses or anywhere else.

1ewbeg1,lj1lez9,GravesForButterflies,"Zionism is not just the right for a Jewish homeland. It was a movement to colonize Palestine and turn it into a Jewish state.

&gt;From 1897 to 1948, the primary goal of the Zionist movement was to establish the basis for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and thereafter to consolidate it. The movement itself recognized that Zionism‚Äôs claim to Palestine went against the commonly accepted interpretation of the principle of self-determination.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism

Palestinians have a right of self determination as well. Cutting off supply to water, food, and the outside world causing mass poverty directly prevents that. 

If Zionism was all about self-preservation, then why are they creating new settlements on occupied territories?

&gt;The first official support to settlement construction came in June 1967, when 160 Arab houses were demolished in the old city of Jerusalem in order to open a court in front of the Western Wall. Immediately, 600 buildings were expropriated and approximately 6,500 Arabs, both tenants and land owners, were removed.

Do students have a right to free speech, or should prior restraint be allowed to be exercised against them when the administration feels threatened?  

As Aristotle asks, are you a citizen, a beast or a god?  Citizens have a duty to ensure equal and fair treatment for all, and to help ensure justice and peace are maintained. 

The actions (or inaction) of the school leaders on Tuesday were unacceptable and of course further compounded by using the excuse of a 4 hour mob attack left unpoliced as an excuse to call riot police onto campus.  Public trust and credibility are earned, not given with the price of tuition and the inability to speak to the matters at hand. 

Once squandered, when students see those in power lie and wield their power corruptly, that cannot be unseen.  Their good name was all they had.  The road to getting it back is through FULL TRANSPARENCY regarding what happened last week and why, and any so called ""investigation"" needs to be 100% transparent and IMMEDIATELY release all public records, emails, text messages, call records etc from all the relevant parties.

The third video looks bad. It's very difficult to make oit what's going on, but it certainly looks bad.

That said, I have a lot of trust in the multiple accounts from the UCLA faculty who were on the ground in and out of the encampment prior to and during the events of last week. I am less trusting of a shakey Instagram video with no clear perspective and a still that has been edited on at the end.

To be clear, I wasn't there and I don't know what happened, but I do know that in contrast with Columbia or USC, prior to last week when the administration withdrew its support and the counter protestors showed up in greater force starting last Monday, the  UCLA encampment was consistently reported as well organized, peaceful, and well regulated in terms of keeping non-students and faculty out. That was definitely not the case with the counter protestors who last Tuesday night showed up with Proud Boys and a wide array of other violent non-campus affiliates in their ranks.

I was a student back in 2010 watching Palestinian students having a small booth across from Ackerman on a cultural day. They were kind/sweet and just doing their thing peacefully‚Ä¶ I also watched as a huge crowd of several white Jewish students stood across from them, many of them on the steps of the Ackerman stairs, held up a huge pro-Israel banner and yelled and shouted incessantly at the Palestinian students.

This went on for hours and the school did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it. It wasn‚Äôt even mentioned. Less than a year later we had Alexandra Wallace and her Asians in the Library YouTube video scandal. The university did nothing but she chose to drop out.

UCLA will do nothing that will offend their wealthy white and Jewish donor base. They ignore the problems that students of color experience on campus.

It is somewhat like what I felt as an American walking around in some foreign countries when Trump was President.  I was careful not to wear any clothing that indicated I was American.  I did not want to have to engage in conversations where I had to defend my country whose leader I did not support and whose actions were not defensible.  Netanyahu is like that for most American Jews I know.  This is what I have heard: They like Israel but not Netanyahu and do not support him.  They feel anger and sadness over Oct. 7 and that made them feel underattack and brought up a lot of bad associations with the past. They are appalled by the way Netanyahu is leading this war and the death he is causing and feel empathy for the Palestinian people.  They find themselves having to disassociate themselves from an immoral leader of a country that they otherwise love.  It is no fun to have to do that all of the time.  I get it.  They sometimes encounter extremists who assume they know how they feel, downplay Oct. 7, and go too far in what they say, occasionally making antisemitic comments.  That is really sad when that happens and it is not okay.

And then there are the people who have a blind allegiance to Israel, can't see this war from any other perspective, show hatred for the Palestinian people, have zero concern for the massive loss of innocent life in Palestine, and yell at anyone who might have a different view.

I was with Israel for the first couple of months of this war as a result of Hamas's atrocities on Oct. 7, but then they lost me. At some point, Israel did more evil than what was done on to them.  Also, I honestly don't know how this war ends.  I don't think Israel can rid the world of Hamas and their actions have created a whole new generation of people who hate Israel.

1. The encampment vandalized the campus. 
2. Not only did they vandalize the campus, they did so via hate crimes: A swastika, a star of David on the ground with instructions to ""step here"" and chants + writing saying ""intifada"" which is a well established call to commit violence against and murder of Jews. 
3. It's illegal camp out on public grounds. 
4. They blocked access to school buildings 
5. Finally , after a week of this homeless encampment, the university told them to disperse. The police gave them six warnings to disperse (and do so freely without consequence). They refused. 
6. Coming back to the calls for INTIFADA. It's odd that the encampment would demand an intifada and be surprised that they were on the receiving end of something akin to an intifada isn't it? It's almost like incitement to violence against a particular group of people....leads to violence? Crazy I know

I know there's a lot of anti-police sentiment and I'm not trying to be an apologist for them, but riot policing requires a lot of officers, and the mobilization of that many officers takes a lot of time. In riots, sending a small number can often lead to a worsening / escalation of the situation, so it's important that police officers only come when they're large enough in number.

&gt;the encampment is somehow blamed instead of the counter-protestors, and thus its removal is justified??

As stated by Gene Block before the counter-protestor rioters came, the reason for the removal was that the encampment was unlawful. It is possible that the removal was hastened after the outbreak of the violence, but the moment that declaration from Gene Block came, the camp's fate was sealed. So the removal was a result of it being deemed unlawful (which is true because that's what civil disobedience is).

&gt;Then you have 5/1 and 5/2, where many students tried, but failed, to prevent the encampment from being eradicated by this partisan police (who, by the way, are using flashbangs and rubber bullets against students just standing their ground),

The police serve to enforce laws. **You can argue that the laws are unjust**, but the police acted in the way that they should have, given the asks of their job.

Of course I would have loved for the university to have left the camp until demands were met, but I know that's not realistic. However, sending someone like Hunt who they KNOW is not capable of getting us even close to what we want, or even remotely knowledge in the problem at hand, is in bad faith. SJP at UCLA details the divestment plans better than I can here, but a poor summary would be removing our millions of dollars in funding from war profiting companies like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, etc.

Hunt said the same thing about the best they could do with the rioters, and I have mixed feelings about that. Either that statement is wholly incorrect, which I'm inclined to believe, and they could have done more than call the police to spectate, OR the results of the night of April 30th were truly after UCLA had exhausted every option they could to protect its students, and yet that was still the outcome. Which option is worse? That UCLA doesn't care, or its power is so minute that it can't protect its students for the entirety of a 4 hour assault? Either option is indicative of a deep problem. 

And to add some extra detail towards UCLA's lack of efforts, it was mentioned to Hunt during his conversation that many calls to the hospital were made, which were met with denial because UCLA had not given permission for their entrance. The hospital HUNG UP on students pleading for help because of UCLA's choice. 
Additionally, to act as if April 30th came out of nowhere is disingenuous. Zionists have been attacking the camp since its inception on a smaller scale, and it was only a matter of time before something bigger happened. We've all taken history classes, we know how these things go. UCLA's excuse currently is that they could not mobilize enough police to have done something without causing increased violence in that amount of time.

The reason why I would like to hear your take on divestment is because I don't believe that for most people's exact demands, I don't think it's feasible for the university. (I think that UCLA could go and tell Blackrock not to put their money in the companies in question, but divesting from any/all asset management firms that has money in those companies is impossible.) Hence, I believe the encampment would've just been left up indefinitely if they stayed until demands were met.

&gt;its power is so minute that it can't protect its students for the entirety of a 4 hour assault? Either option is indicative of a deep problem.

No doubt it's a problem, and it's a serious lack of injustice that the assault happened for so long and that there were no arrests. But I want to ask you what you what you think the university could've/should've done to handle it better. I am really of the belief that the university did the best they could even though it was inadequate. My understand is that the private security couldn't intervene, so UCLA was reliant upon the LAPD, and mobilization for riot policing takes a long time. You could criticize the LAPD though (I wouldn't defend them because I'm not super knowledgeable about riot policing and it's possible their organization/whatnot was bad). I would reject the other option: that UCLA doesn't care. You could call me a naive optimist, but I really think UCLA does care about its students.

As for the stuff about the hospital, I don't mean to be dismissive, and I'm not saying that none of that happened, but I would like some credible source that's not just hearsay.

&gt;UCLA had DAYS to develop some sort of contingency plan to protect its students from a serious attack.

True, but I don't think this is a super reasonable expectation. There's no question that these students at the encampment had a lack of (explicit) for the law, and UCLA then chose to be hands off about it and let them be for a few days. But the key is that UCLA chose to be hands off. They could've put out the dispersal order + called in police much earlier, but they didn't. Police were not called to any other altercations at the encampment (we could both agree they'd be unwelcomed by the encampment), and so they were not ready when the rioters came by and shit went really bad. In a world where there is always justice (excluding the fact that then the cause for the encampment wouldn't exist), the police would've been there to immediately arrest the rioters. But asking for a large group of riot police to be on-call and ready to come to the encampment is simply a very tall order.

1cj06o1,l2dkwya,Ramen-Naruto,"Yes, the encampments are illegal, but under the 1st Amendment should be protected nonetheless, as they by themselves were not significantly disruptive. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

The police should interfere when a protest becomes violent and majorly disruptive, and in this case it was mainly counter-protestors who contributed to this. However, instead of arresting these counter-protestors or at the minimum quelling tensions between these two sides, they instead were told to go after the encampments themselves, which is simply incomprehensible.

In an ideal world, the police would be regulating protests on both sides and arresting violent offenders, rather than simply arresting an entire group under the assumption that every one of them is violent. Obviously asking for such a high commitment from campus police without increasing tensions might be difficult irl, but at least an effort would have been made, which does not seem to be the case here.

Here, all they did was take the easy way out by removing peaceful protestors at a convenient time for themselves (i.e. after the encampment had been already devastated by 4 hours of counter-protestor bombardments and 1-2 days of stand-off), which achieved their goal of removing all potential for violence, but also came at a cost of rights protected by the 1st Amendment...",7,1714731437.0,t1_l2ddtfe
1cj06o1,l2dmjzt,araja_abbado,"&gt;but under the 1st amendment should  be protected nonetheless

I don't believe this is true, but again, someone definitely correct me if I'm wrong about the law. 
My understanding is that an action can be free speech (and thus protected by the first amendment in that way) but be illegal in some other way, thus making the action itself illegal. Obvious examples would be shouting ""bomb"" in a theater since you put people at risk or saying ""kill [some person, maybe a leader in the context of a protest]"" which is inciting violence. Both of these illegal. Another example could be wearing an armband, which is free speech (tinker des moines), but if, for example, it were to have graphic pornography (and nothing else), it would be illegal due to obscenity laws. This would be in spite of the fact that the armband is worn for some political cause and be thus free speech. Aside from activity like vandalism, the encampment itself was illegal because legally, you need to get a permit to do that

Yeah, I just do not understand why none of the rioters were arrested. But I mean, the police going after the protestors was not related to the fact that the protestors were peaceful. That's not relevant when considering that the encampment itself was illegal (is my belief). If the police were to follow the law to the letter (and have probable cause etc.), then all the rioters and all the people in the encampment who didn't disburse should have been arrested. The lack of arrests on the rioters doesn't make the arrests of the protestors unjustified, but of course I agree it's a total failure to do justice on one end. It is not okay that those rioters were able to leave freely. If i were to be charitable, it's possible they didn't have probable cause to arrest any particular individual at the time, but I truly have no idea.",3,1714732480.0,t1_l2dkwya

No doubt again. I'm sure we both agree that it probably would've been unjust if Block spontaneously declared it unlawful and had police raid 30 minutes later.

-  knowingly and willfully interfere with the peaceful conduct of the activities of the campus or any campus facility by intimidating, harassing, or obstructing any University employee, student, or any other person having lawful business with the University  
...  
- delay or linger without lawful purpose for being on the property and for the purpose of committing a crime or violation of these policies as opportunity may be discovered  
...  
- engage in the production of amplified or non-amplified sound that disrupts campus activities;  camp or lodge, except in authorized facilities or locations  
...  
- participate in a disturbance of the peace or unlawful assembly

Personal assessment here (I'm not sure how the university admin came to their conclusion), but almost none of these actually apply to the encampment at hand, except possibly the first and last one. Unlawful assembly is too vaguely defined at least in this regulation handbook. Yes, freedom of speech is not absolute, as has been addressed by many Supreme Court cases. But I feel like at worst this is closer to the burning of the U.S. flag in Texas v. Johnson, in which symbolic action is protected as a form of free speech. 

Nevertheless, what is not being argued about is whether the police were following stated law in their dispersal of the encampment, but rather whether the act of doing so is unconstitutional, regardless of said law.

Many, MANY UCLA students don't realize just how DIFFICULT opportunity is to come by in the world and that as rough as it is at UCLA, other universities, colleges, and institutions are even rougher. Forget the amazing accomplished professors - many of your TAs stand head and shoulders above their peers. You don't realize just how impressive they are until you yourself try to apply to graduate school. 

You will pound the pavement. You'll be rejected from clubs. You'll have cold emails go unresponded. You'll have apathetic professors who view teaching as a burden of their contracts. Welcome to life.

First of all, it's obvious that you aren't Greek and haven't the slightest idea about the big picture of Greek life. You're simply spitting out the same rhetoric that every other anti Greek person spews. You have no idea what it's like to be Greek and until you do I suggest you at least learn to use the English language because if being in a fraternity taught me anything, it's how to properly use the English language. Fraternity life also taught me not to discriminate against something or an organization simply because YOU YOURSELF couldn't be a part of it or couldn't afford to be a part of it.¬† Just because you chose not to take part in it doesn't give you the right to judge others that are part of what they consider a life long brotherhood that most people will never have!!¬† All that nonsense you are talking about not hiring someone because they took part in Greek life is beyond ridiculous and pretty much shows WHY you didn't take part in Greek life. Some people just don't have what it takes and some do! I've seen guys that wouldn't even consider attempting to ask a female out or much less engage in a conversation with a girl. Maybe he's a bit awkward but after becoming a part of a fraternity, he ventures out of his comfort zone thanks to the social functions. Also, I don't think anyone beyond graduating from college has any plans about bringing up any type of nonsense or fraternity pranks, hazing etc. that they took part in in college/Greek life, to the work place.¬† Believe me most pledges are exhausted and are just ready to get that initiation pin and go to bed for about 12 hours. (Believe it or not, most of the line-ups, ""idiotic"" behavior and humiliation tactics are used so you'll learn to think about other people (your pledge brothers) and doing things as a unit and a team. You learn to trust your pledge brothers because you share a common cause... wanting to be part of something larger than yourself. It's not all fun and games like people think.¬† After pledgeship is done, everything that happened during this time is better understood to be nothing but part of a larger picture that will be revealed to you when you're able to finally walk through that chapter room door. At that point, EVERYTHING IS FORGOTTEN ABOUT OR GOTTEN OUT DURING a GRIEVANCE meeting so there isn't any hard feelings between the new brothers and the older brothers.

I don‚Äôt normally respond to these but I am in a terrible mood so please forgive me. The classic ‚Äúnot all Greek organizations‚Äù defense‚Äîan impressively weak attempt at damage control. That‚Äôs like saying, ‚ÄúNot every member of the KKK is against all Black people,‚Äù as if that somehow redeems the larger system. The fact that some fraternities don‚Äôt engage in the worst behaviors doesn‚Äôt erase the ones that do, nor does it negate the culture that enables them.

Your entire response reeks of insecurity disguised as superiority. Instead of addressing the critique, you attack grammar, question someone‚Äôs ‚Äúright‚Äù to have an opinion, and assume that anyone critical of fraternities must be bitter about not getting in. That‚Äôs not an argument‚Äîit‚Äôs deflection.

Fraternities love to preach about brotherhood and leadership, but the moment someone questions their culture, members like you scramble to dismiss them as outsiders who ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have what it takes.‚Äù If being Greek means developing this kind of thin-skinned arrogance, then maybe some people are better off without it.",1,1743148714.0,t1_lr41ffg
1czpto1,m3y9xh5,klostinwonderland,"Just wanted to hop on this and remind that some schools aren't even remotely like this regarding greek life, and aren't set up like 'traditional' greek life with hazing/houses/etc on campus.

If the chapter is functioning as it was truly meant to, these organizations provide opportunities for actual leadership and life skills that i believe help make the world a brighter place... so please dont automatically write everyone off like that before you even know them or their experience (at schools you've never heard of - totally agree about this particular chapter being a red flag bc of this known evidence).

I personally don't list mine on linkedin because of comments like yours and its really ok with me, i dont see it as a necessity to share in order to get a job. however, i just wanted to share that i was a founding member of my chapter 10 years ago, and we worked really hard to create a safe and welcoming organization for all on campus. i held an exec role and took the experience for what it was promised to be by the national rep that helped us found the chapter. and i can also genuinely say everyone in my class are some of the best people I know, with many admirable leaders in their current careers including a pediatric oncologist, a few hospice nurses, a pediatric dental surgeon, an overseas doctor, a few nonprofit executive directors, esl and special needs advocates, teachers and army medics. they were leaders in our chapter and it was an overall great experience without an ounce of the bullshit listed above.",2,1735256473.0,t1_l5im78s

1hq1h36,m4n4tdb,Plumplie,"I'm not sure what would need to be done for WW to be pulled out of its death spiral. Off the top of my head:

1) The death of NIMBYism by WW community government, which has been blocking liquor licenses for new businesses - they want WW for homeowners, not for students

2) A significant cultural change among students, moving away from DoorDash and dining halls on weekends and towards patronizing local business 

3) Make WW feel safer; visible homelessness and retail theft both have likely contributed to the decline, though I'm not sure whether the decline precipitated more visible homelessness or vice versa. I just know that fewer people are going to want to come and hang out in a place where the toothpaste at the local CVS is practically under armed guard 

4) The business culture of WW needs to change more generally, and I don't know if that's a chicken or egg situation. There are fewer and fewer places for students to hang out and study in WW, and bringing those places back can't really precede the three things above, but also the three things above won't change in the absence of business.

I almost feel like WW needs a shock to the system to move it out of its current bad equilibrium. I'm not sure if UCLA can get involved and throw its weight around, especially with respect to 1) and 3); I've also wondered if UCLA might sponsor/support more student-run business in Westwood, though that probably seems like small potatoes relative to the amount of vacancy we're talking about here",12,1735618282.0,t3_1hq1h36

You seem to be confusing real elected leaders of the Palestinians and the Palestinians themselves for terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah who happen to be made up a small minority of Palestinians.

That‚Äôs like saying because the CIM

Now if you want to talk corruption in general I‚Äôm about it. Corruption inhabits most authority structures. But speaking at least for Fatah that‚Äôs not the case.

1fo1nh6,loowgmy,Kellysi83,"No I mean dogma.  There‚Äôs so much more nuance out there than simply you are white and thus have privilege, and this is why we on the left are losing not only poor uneducated whites, who‚Äôve also been left behind by the neoliberal agenda, but also conservative Latinos that do not care for some of our policies that do not align with their social beliefs.

Yes I realize white privilege is a very real and powerful concept.  Try explaining that to a poor, low information, white, southern/rural community, where there are no jobs and drug addiction is the standard, not the exception.

Yes, from our ivory educated tower we understand the very real systems and forces in place that STILL even place this white, southern, poor, drug addicted community at an ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù, but it really isn‚Äôt helpful that we bring this frame of reference out into society without respecting the nuances.  It‚Äôs really turning people off from the left, which should be the side of the political spectrum working for all the marginalized.

And the left used to be a place that did work for these people too.  However, we‚Äôve abandoned them.  In that vacuum of leadership, they‚Äôve turned to Trump and MAGA.

So yes, I‚Äôm calling it dogma because it‚Äôs almost taught with a militant fervor and if you bring any nuance to light in seminar, you will be shouted down.

Trust me, I‚Äôve seen it happen many times.  I didn‚Äôt even consider it till I was out teaching in the real world and having dialogues with families.

And furthermore this serves the powerful on both sides.  As long as the working class and poor are turning against each other over issues such as race, gender, orientation, etc. both sides continue the grift of taking money from the bottom rungs to hoard at the top.

When people came together post GFC in the Occupy Movement, that was seen as a little too dangerous for those in leadership/power.

If you bring up the fact that statistically speaking, as a monolithic demographic, across all racial subgroups, men are underperforming academically faaar below their female counterparts (again even within racial subgroups) you are called out for being anti feminists and a manipulated evangelist for the patriarchy.

If we were discussing this kind of astounding disparity across any other demographic lines we‚Äôd be sounding the alarms, it‚Äôs that bad.  Again, none of this was brought to my attention in both my undergrad as a history major, minoring in poly sci at UCLA or in my MA program in critical pedagogy at UCLA.   It‚Äôs something I started to notice as a high school teacher, and began looking into.

And the results of suppressing this discourse, because it doesn‚Äôt hold with the party line of only considering traditionally ‚Äúmarginalized‚Äù groups, is that we again see boys and men turning to charlatans like Andrew Tate, Trump, and Elon Musk.  Or even worse carrying out violence against others and themselves.

There is so much to this and we need to have honest conversations about the many groups in this country and how their needs are being met (or not).  

A lot of it will come down to class, I can assume that much.  Wealth distribution should be the main topic of conversation, but we need to address all of the other issues as well.  

We are living in a very dynamic and diverse society and era of history.  No other place on the planet is as heterogeneous as the US and things have never happened with such rapidity.  There are no simple explanations here, but we‚Äôve gotta stop placing people in simple boxes. Even those who seemingly have power.",9,1727196950.0,t1_lopoqvn

1fo1nh6,loqnjb5,Kellysi83,"If you are speaking to percentages of black people in poverty from the black population, you would be correct.  But as far as actual numbers in poverty you are incorrect.  This merely comes down to the fact that 60% of the US population is white and 14% of the US population is black.

Presently there are approximately 16.5 million white individuals, non hispanic, in poverty, and about 8.34 million black individuals living in poverty.  That's nearly double.  

Nonetheless, where the starkest disparity in outcomes even amongst individual groups can be seen is in the fact that of the ""white"" population only 8.2% are below the poverty line; while amongst the black population, 18.9% fall below the poverty line.  

Additionally, blacks suffer far worse outcomes in nearly every category--health, wealth, education, housing, etc.  I am not denying ANY OF THIS.  I have read just about every single author on critical pedgagoy you can think of from Friere, to FANON, to Hooks, and so on.  You aren't speaking anything new to me.

Where my area of concern lies (in relevance to the OP and our greater issue as a society) is actually in looking at these poverty numbers combined with working class numbers.  As of the last census, approximately 89.5 million whites, non-hispanic were considered ""working class"".  Approximately 20 million blacks were considered ""working class"". 

Herein lies the issue, the progressive wing of the Democratic party has chosen to dismiss 106 million people in our country because they are ""white,"" so therefore they have ""privilege,"" and are not also being left behind by the modern economy.

While you and I may understand the very specific and relevant disparity and needs of communties such as the black or latino communities in the US; we still need to as a whole, recognize that there are also many ""white"" people falling to the margins as a result of the neoliberal consensus, and POLITICALLY we are turning them off and losing them to the likes of Trump, MAGA, and the Project 2025 agenda.

Additionally, poorer neighborhoods tend to have higher crime rates. It‚Äôs not that poorer people commit more crime; it‚Äôs that these areas are denser, which can lead to more incidents.

1fo1nh6,lomzl0s,AmbivertMusic,"I don't know the entire context of this orientation (is it for all students, for a certain major, who is sending it, etc.), but I don't think it's a helpful thing to have in orientation without a greater conversation and historical context, and I think it's not entirely well presented.

To be clear, I think most people would say I'm fairly liberal and I am critical of law enforcement/the criminal justice system in the U.S., but I think this narrows in on ""white"" and ""male"" too much. I'd say the criminal justice system is more supportive of wealth and power, and prejudiced against certain minority groups more than it is supportive of white males specifically and purposefully. For instance, is there no privilege (in terms of criminal justice) for white women or, what some would (incorrectly) call/consider, ""model minorities?"" What about the role wealth plays? If my well-off Asian mother-in-law believes the police exist to protect her based on her experiences, does she have white male privilege?

I think it is more accurate to say that the police and criminal justice system often privilege those with power and wealth, which, in the U.S., white males tend to have more of than other groups. For instance, I believe the police and criminal justice system are more likely to privilege a rich Asian woman over a poor white man. Of course that is not true in all cases and, historically, law enforcement has attracted people racist against minorities as well as sexists, but speaking in generalities and focused more on the present, I think the police/criminal justice system mostly privileges and protects power and wealth (which, to reiterate, does still often mean white males in the U.S.).

It's also important to note that racial prejudices obviously also play a role, but I do feel that aspect, while still prominent and present, is diminishing over time (at least compared to how it was in the past).

I guess what I'm saying is that I think while white males do tend to benefit the most from the criminal justice system in the U.S., it is not entirely and inherently because they are white and male in a vacuum; it is more because they tend to be the group with wealth and power, and I think that is an important context (or at least discussion) to consider. Zooming out a bit, I think people can see that in most societies around the world (including non-white majority and more homogeneous societies), it works similarly in terms of the effects of wealth and power over the justice system. Of course, it is also important to note that in some countries, the laws are far more sexist and do more inherently privilege males specifically (not to go on a tangent, but I just want to make it clear that I'm aware the U.S. also has sexist laws, but that's going too far off topic to get into).

I suppose my problem with this kind of privilege orientation is that it oversimplifies a complex problem, making it seem to some that being white and male is to blame, rather than the power structures and history that make it that way. I know this is just an orientation blurb, and I know they specifically mention the U.S., but I feel like it does more harm than good, leading to misunderstandings and misrepresentations.

Police forces were basically invented to protect property and for a decent chunk of time the only people that were allowed to have property were white men.

I am 58 year old Latina, Class of ‚Äò89. In most environments I can pass for white. It truly depends on what I am wearing and who I am with. If I am by myself and I‚Äôm dressed as if I was attending a UCLA sorority event, then yes, I trust the police will protect me. If I am with my darker skinned cousins who have tattoos and look a bit ‚Äúghetto‚Äù, I may not trust the police to protect me due to negative profiling of the group I‚Äôm with. 

Law enforcement men and women are humans first, each with their own life experiences, and I recognize they also need to feel safe in their jobs. Whenever I come in contact with police I see it as MY job to help them feel safe in their interactions with me. I make sure NOT to say or do anything that could trigger an alert for them. (Maybe that‚Äôs the better question? Have you ever felt that it was YOUR job to help a police officer feel safe when interacting with you? Perhaps that is a better signal of privilege?) Sadly, police officers feeling safe in their jobs is becoming harder and harder in our world and they likely have more reasons to lead with prejudice and profiling. 

Like others have said, I wish the statement you highlighted were more nuanced. I am not a white male. Most of the time I DO trust the police to protect me.  But sometimes, in certain contexts, I may not trust them to see me as an individual if I happen to be part of a group that could be profiled.

""Ranks will close, fighters joining other fighters, and masses everywhere in the Islamic world will come forward in response to the call of duty, loudly proclaiming: 'Hail to Jihad!'. This cry will reach the heavens and will go on being resounded until liberation is achieved, the invaders vanquished and Allah's victory comes about.""¬†*(Article 33)*

The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight **Jews** and **kill them**. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.""¬†*(Article 7)*

This is what i keep saying.

No, I am not painting all UCLA students with the same brush, but it is a fact that there are more students fully funded by their parents, unemployed, and spoiled at schools like UCLA and USC, why? because these are super competitive schools to get into and many of the students at these schools come form afluent families who can afford tutoring and extracurricular activities for their kids while in high school which would help their chances of getting in.

Notice how these encampments in the LA area are only at UCLA, USC, and Occidental College? Expensive, private 2/3, and more bougie. 

Meanwhile, take a look at the other state schools near us that are more commuter schools, like CSU Los Angeles and Northridge. Like 90 percent of those students have jobs and are struggling a lot more to worry about performative activism, those people work for a living.

ah i always interpreted that 90% number as the other UCs needing to essentially subsidize la/berk/san diego (or any school with a large + lucrative engineering school - san diego is in a pretty similar tier to la for a lot of engineering which is the target audience of people willing to pay 60k/yr for an education).

i also disagree with the premise there is no demand. for example, ucsb has a LOWER acceptance rate for oos students (ucla has a higher acceptance rate for oos than instate). this definitely implies that there is demand‚Ä¶

im also confused why the prestige thing is more improtant that california reaidents if it dosent actually improve student capabilities. again the mission of the UC system is to serve CA residents, not to be prestigious. also note that ucla is much more prestigious than umich or uva AND has a higher instate population (although this is probably largely because CA has a much bigger population overall and a much bigger local population within LA. umich and uva have a fraction of the students to draw from and also just have a lot more interstate diversity by virtue of being tiny states in comparison) 

its ultimately up to opinion but imo these policies are what the UC is meant to do - serve CA residents. i dont see how being elite is more important than this goal - especially because ucla is already an amazing school and should be using that to raise up the CA population, not accumulate more prestige just for the sake of it‚Ä¶",2,1728789736.0,t1_lrnv3h2

90% is completely delusional, no other state public flagship has an in-state enrollment anywhere near that level. michigan (which is comparable) is roughly 50%!!

what is the point of CSU if UC is now brought to the same level for undergraduate education? why do we need to cannibalize the CSU system which is already underenrolled and threatened by newsom's push for higher UC enrollment?",0,1728861852.0,t1_lrspfhl
1g27lpt,lrv6gu6,2apple-pie2,"The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) has a 91.9% in-state attendance rate. This is a lot more than UCLA/B currently has. This is the flagship university of Texas and is an AMAZING school in its own right so i disagree with the premise that reputation will plumet - the effect will probably be small. 

UT is way more comparable to CA - california has a much bigger population than virtually any other state so it can and should accept more in-state students. Michigan is just one school and has a huge endowment, making it hard to compare to the UCs for other reasons. 

The UC is meant to serve academically minded students while the CSU is meant to train a workforce. UCLA is a great school meant to serve the population of CA, so forcing perfectly competent students out to get more $ from marginally better international/oos students is honestly more than a money grab than actually improving the reputation. 

The very best students are not in the 10%, so many students in CA who dont get in are honestly just as capable as your average UCLA students‚Ä¶

edit:
basically it sounds like you only care about the prestige of your degree and way overestimate the student body. i know and got into UCLA and see competent students literally everywhere. im not sure where the superiority of oos/intl students comes from when californian students are amazingly competent as well (i saw 0 difference throughout my 4 years of education - although i ended up not attending ucla)

1g27lpt,lrwjnka,_compiled,"again, these are valid points too.

i just think the value of the UCLA undergraduate degree includes being able to learn things and interact with people from outside CA, which itself is educational (and an invaluable networking opportunity). and having people from outside the country makes us an internationally reputed institution. many of our PhDs were intl students who did UG here.

i also want to add, we do not own any oil and gas fields which fund a massive chunk of our operating revenue and general fund. UT Austin does. my point was never that we cannot admit more in-state, it's that the state government needs to compensate for this change.

The claim that ‚Äòeveryone lives 1+ hour away‚Äô isn‚Äôt unique to dining staff; long commutes are a reality for most people working in LA. And while UCLA‚Äôs parking fees are frustrating, they apply to all employees, not just dining workers.

As for benefits, UCLA‚Äôs packages typically include comprehensive health insurance, retirement plans, and generous leave policies, which are often better than many private-sector alternatives.

By the way, wearing masks to hide one's indentity violates university rules and, in the context of the enforcement of the encampment's law-violating policies, California Penal Code 185 (*‚ÄúIt's unlawful for anyone to wear any mask, false whiskers, or any personal disguise (whether complete or partial) for the purpose of (1) evading or escaping discovery, recognition, or identification in the commission of any public offense, or (2) concealment, flight, or escape when charged with, arrested for or convicted of any public offense.‚Äù)*",2,1715007362.0,t1_l2t6afz

All of this rarely happens unless you set off a smoke alarm or do it without your roommates' permission. Just because you smell it doesn't mean you can necessarily prove who was smoking.

1cm2xni,l2xqmnx,MithraicMembrane,"For those curious, the strike authorization vote takes place next week (13-15th I believe). A 2/3 majority vote means that a strike may be called if the UC fails to meet demands of the bargaining team.

If this vote fails, the UAW4811 workers would not have the same legal protections against retaliation. Withholding labor at this point is considered an individual action and a wildcat strike. These types of actions can result in immediate firing from UCLA and are wicked risky for the worker. We like to avoid these when possible 

I participated in the last SAV and strike organizing effort, and it took an absolute insane amount of work and required UC wide coordination for months ahead of time. This situation is very different from a typical unfair labor practice strike, so it‚Äôs tough for me to gauge its chance of success, but I would encourage everyone to talk about it and get the word out to give it some momentum ahead of time!

I don‚Äôt think any of this is rumor mongering - the ULP was filed and the SAV is happening. For me, just getting a 2/3 majority vote is a far bigger obstacle than the no-strike clause being invalidated and a potential strike being ruled illegal. And if it is not sanctioned, given the atmosphere, I‚Äôd expect wildcat actions to begin popping up. 

My point being, while we may not legally be sanctioned to strike, many workers may very well choose to strike - we will always have the ability to withhold labor.

T-I-P-S covers what employers cannot say or do:

T is for Threats. Employers cannot threaten employees with consequences if they support or vote for the union. Employers can‚Äôt discipline, terminate, reduce benefits, or take other adverse action against employees because they support a union.

I is for Interrogate. Employers are not allowed to ask employees questions about the organizing effort, what they think about it, or the names of employees who support the union or attend meetings.

P is for Promise. Employers cannot promise pay increases, greater benefits, promotions or other valuable items in exchange for keeping the union out.

S is for Surveillance. Using spies (whether employees or not), video cameras, or taking photos of people attending a union meeting are all banned as surveillance.

1chgolj,l291wp2,redthrowaway1976,"&gt;Agreed.¬†Though this would qualify as crimes that should be arrested by police and prosecuted in the courts.

Yet that doesn't happen. Israel doesn't hold settler terrorists accountable.

There's extensive data on it:  [https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.yesh-din.org/data+sheet+2023/YeshDin+-+Netunim+2023+-+ENG\_04.pdf](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.yesh-din.org/data+sheet+2023/YeshDin+-+Netunim+2023+-+ENG_04.pdf)

&gt;The IDF would have no involvement.

The IDF has a duty to stop active attacks, and can then detain the perpetrator until police show up to arrest them.

Instead, as we saw above, the IDF is literally involved - by protecting settler terrorists.

Did you look at the video I linked above? This was in a Palestinian village. Armed settlers went to harass Palestinians in a village, with IDF soldier protection. The settler proceeded to shoot a Palestinian point blank - and then walked away with his soldier buddy.

Plenty more examples - like the time settlers ambushed a funeral convoy with help from the IDF in October, killing two people.",1,1714660991.0,t1_l256wd9

That makes what, 3.5% of cases actually are indicted - and then only half of those are found guily. Some others are, for example, found guilty ""without a conviction"", whatever that means.

So it is more accurate to say the vast majority of settlers face no consequences for their terror attacks on Palestinians.

We had the most team titles for a while, but Stanford got past us and pulled away in the 2010s which was also a weak period for UCLA athletics. 

The biggest issue is we had a bunch of dynasties that petered out. Softball, MVB, water polo, men's basketball, tennis, etc. are all historically great programs but their championship rate has drastically fallen the last three decades. The rise of schools like Texas, OU, Florida, etc. in sports we were traditional strong in really hurt. And of course Stanford rising and has personally denied up many titles over the last couple decades. Basically, a few decades ago, there was a shift in the Stanford admin. They adopted a belief that if Stanford is going to compete in these sports they should do their best and be good. Unfortunately one of our best sells is our academics and Stanford takes a lot of those recruits. 

Our Olympic success has historically been neck and neck with SC. Stanford is the newer kid on the block. A big reason we fell behind was the Title IX sacrifices of UCLA's men's gymnastics and men's swimming. Those have a disproportionately large number of medals. When we dropped men's swimming, it negatively impacted our women's swimming program too. There's also been a massive decline in our Track and Field program, another medal heavy sport. SC and Oregon have really taken us to the cleaners in recruiting those sports. Stanford racks up medals in the Ivy league type sports too (fencing, sailing, etc.) that UCLA doesn't sponsor.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_an_Anti-Zionist_Friend

""Letter to an Anti-Zionist Friend"" is an open letter attributed to Martin Luther King Jr. that expressed support for Zionism and declared that ""anti-Zionist is inherently anti-Semitic, and ever will be so.""[1] The letter‚Äôs authenticity is questioned.

History

The letter may have been based on a statement made by King at a dinner event in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[2] According to Seymour Martin Lipset, who was present at that dinner, an African American student made a statement sharply critical of Zionists at the dinner that Lipset recalled as having taken place ""shortly before he was assassinated"",[3] and King replied: ""Don't talk like that. ***When people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews. You're talking anti-Semitism***.""[4]

and another version of the above

He is also attributed with having said, ‚ÄúWhen people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews. You‚Äôre talking anti-Semitism,‚Äù **in response to a student** who had attacked Zionism during a dinner event with Dr. King in 1968.

He also wrote scathingly about apartheid in South Africa, calling it ‚Äúthe worst racism in the world‚Äù.¬†

Anyone who is familiar with Dr. King‚Äôs work knows that he would be appalled at Israel‚Äôs treatment of the Palestinians.

Edit: You edited your comment, so I‚Äôll edit mine as well. I disagree with the idea that Zionism = Judaism firmly, and whether or not Bernice King said it, believe MLK would be opposed to it too.

1gkt1hy,lw51l8q,3AlanKing3,"I do agree that Trump has indeed said and done pretty much all of those things you have mentioned. At the same time, a lot of it has to do with Trump's manner of speaking, where statements are exaggerated to intimidate people and to set things straight, even when they sound concerning at first. For example, Trump declaring that he would be a dictator on day 1, I looked into exactly what he said and Trump stated that he would only be a dictator on day 1 as a figure of speech for taking a lot of excessive action that people would fairly interpret as something a dictator would do. But according to him, it will only be a day one event. I'm sure Trump will likely take more action after that, though. 

From my point of view, no candidate is perfect. Trump's got a lot of drawbacks and a lot of blunders I've seen him do that have upset me (especially his handling of Covid-19 and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election which resulted in the insurrection whether he intended on it or not). But, overall, when it comes to what I think the nation needs to get accomplished, Trump appeared to be the better candidate for my support based on his current promises and yes, the fact that he is willing to take extreme action to get things done quickly on a large scale. 

I appreciate your reply though, it helped remind me about the likely downsides to Trump's new presidency. I'm a centrist so I try to keep myself informed of both sides of what they aim to do. It just happened that Trump appealed to me more. Thank you for sharing some of the things Trump has said and done!",1,1731098009.0,t1_lw4cgjc

Seems a bit more egoically motivated. I'm pretty sure these protestors have never even read one historical book on the history of the region. If they did, they'd realize the situation isn't black and white, it's one tragic dumpster fire. And, as others have said here, Israel has offered ceasefires - but asked for hostages to be returned.

Also, where were the protestors when US-backed Azerbaijan ethnically cleansed Armenians in 2023?

1cy5s46,l57bq9r,Exastiken,"&gt; UCLA Police Chief John Thomas has been removed from his post and reassigned, officials said, weeks after he faced sharp criticism for security failures that led to violence at a pro-Palestinian encampment.
&gt; 
&gt; Rick Braziel, associate vice chancellor who heads the newly created Office of Campus Safety, informed Thomas this week that he would be reassigned while internal and external investigations examine campus security shortfalls that left UCLA students and others involved in the protest encampment to fend for themselves against attackers for three hours before law enforcement moved in to quell the melee.
&gt; 
&gt; UCLA Police Captain Gawin Gibson was named interim police chief as of Tuesday, according to Mary Osako, vice chancellor for strategic communications.
&gt; 
&gt; She added that UCLA‚Äôs Office of Campus Safety ‚Äúis leading a thorough examination of our security processes aimed at enhancing the well-being and safety of our community.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Thomas did not return texts and calls for comment.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúGiven Chief Thomas‚Äô mishandling of keeping our community safe and ear-splitting calls for him to step aside, this had to happen,‚Äù said one source, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
&gt; 
&gt; Thomas had lost confidence within UCLA and among some outside law enforcement officials, who have criticized what they said was the police chief‚Äôs lack of proper planning, coordination and communication in creating a campus safety plan and securing enough officers to carry it out should violence occur at the encampment. Both the police chief and Michael Beck, the administrative vice chancellor who oversaw the police department and Office of Emergency Management at the time, have faced calls for their resignation. Braziel has taken over both of those units as chief safety officer.
&gt; 
&gt; After pro-Palestinian supporters put up an encampment in a grassy quad at UCLA, campus leadership asked Thomas to create a written, detailed safety plan laying out actions for various scenarios ‚Äî from rallies to skirmishes to full-blown violence ‚Äî but did not receive one, three sources told The Times. The police chief was told to use whatever overtime pay was needed to secure help from external law enforcement, But Thomas said a paperwork logjam between the city and state prevented him from completing any contracts before the encampment was attacked on the night of April 30.
&gt; 
&gt; Thomas, in an earlier interview with The Times, defended his actions and said he did the best he could.
&gt; 
&gt; The shake-up at the UCLA police department comes after more than three tense weeks on campus since the violent mob attack.
&gt; 
&gt; Thomas was appointed police chief in January and had served as interim chief since 2022. He came to UCLA from USC in 2022 as interim police chief. At USC, he had been the Dept. of Public Safety executive and chief since 2013. He worked as an assistant chief and police captain at USC after arriving on campus in 2009 from the LAPD, where he was a lieutenant. He also previously served in the Washington, D.C. police department.
&gt; 
&gt; The decision on police leadership took place before UCLA Chancellor Gene Block is scheduled to testify in Washington, D.C. at a House education committee hearing on antisemitism alongside the presidents of Rutgers and Northwestern universities. The committee is expected to aggressively grill Block about the April 30 violence at the UCLA encampment and accusations of antisemitism during pro-Palestinian protests.
&gt; 
&gt; Earlier congressional hearings have featured the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Columbia University
&gt; 
&gt; University of California President Michael V. Drake has launched an external investigation into the security, which Block says he welcomes as he initiates his own review.",30,1716400585.0,t3_1cy5s46
1cy5s46,l57pfkc,[deleted],"What a bullshit headline. The main security failure was allowing a violent mob to rampage unchecked for hours - a violent mob that ATTACKED the pro-Palestinian protestors.

1cy5s46,l58irtp,Jean_dodge67,"That's a legitimate concern and a good question to speak to.  But how do we address it?  Shouldnt the administration AND the students and faculty be overseeing the ""investigation"" into the failures that led to 4/30?  Why is only the administration privy to the records of what they and the police did that night?  

It's pretty clear that student protesters fully expected the tactic of seeing ""escalating violence on campus"" to be the reason the encampment protest would get shut down. IN fact, it did happen just like that. That's why they advocated the discipline of ""don't call 911"" and hoped to continue to use their barricades and protest movement tactics of keeping thugs out of the encampment as the best way to continue a peaceful protest.  While there had been assaults the previous nights, the encampment wasn't prepared for a coordinated assault by a mob but it was fully underway before they understood what they faced. 

A mob is a collection of rank cowards who need one another to goad themselves into criminal action under the cover or superior numbers.  There's a ""critical mass"" that happens.  It's not fully predictable but that's why GOOD POLICE WORK is supposed to be ahead of it, and able to stop it before it starts. 

Whether the LAPD responds on campus or not is NEVER in the hands of students.  It's not even in the hand of UCLA PD police chief  Thomas.  Letting town cops come onto campus is an ADMINISTRATION decision.  The reason for it is because a University campus is predicated on the foundational notion that this is a place for Academic Freedom.  For intellectual and political debate and conflict, and that when it's almost always students and faculty who are here, the small cop shop can handle any unrest or problems. 

Inviting the LAPD anywhere is a mixed bag, let's face it.  No one really wanted it.  The real solution would have been to not let the counter-protest pro-israel group to set up so close to the Pro-Palestinian group.   I'm very curious how that decision was made. 

but we aren't getting the public records and public recordings we need to explain things of this nature, nor or the real timeline of when which cops were called, etc on 4/30.  Truth be told, by 10:30 PM it was probably already too late to stop what was coming fully, but even the private security could have and should have done a better job.

The pro-Israel crowd seek out and cause confrontation and in this case, the head of the Anti-Defamation League helped fucking incite it when he attended the pro-Israel rally on campus days before. He wasn't the only one either. There's at least one student gov't candidate who spoke at that rally who also not only incited violence, but also harassed numerous protestors and was there nights later among the violent counter-protestors. He was also seen hanging with the cops.",0,1716468746.0,t1_l58irtp
1cy5s46,l5cw38i,Jean_dodge67,"You're right that the Pro-Israel crowd was intent on mayhem.  But common sense would tell you to put them farther apart from the encampment than easy handgun range.  Or, as we saw, mortar range with the skyrockets.  When a mob can gin it self up in an area filled with cowards until a bunch goad themselves into a criminal assault, and then suddenly thrust forward in a few seconds to attack and retreat, that's not good. You want to separate the cowards from their ""safe space"" as much as possible.  If the law enforcement group lacks the sufficient numbers to thwart the assaults, they can arrest the violent ones when they retreat to their pod, in the open space of a vast no-man's land, or at the very minimum disrupt the rhythm of the assaults by dispersing the mob's epicenter. 

The administration didn't have to make it so easy for them.  It seems like the distance was determined by the Jumbotron's real purpose - not to play images and sounds for their own rally, but for the purpose of intimidating the encampment.  That led to five days of incitement as you say.  

Note the university didn't create any forum for actions that were anything but civil disobedience.  I doubt it would have gone off well but there could have been public debates on the issue of a two-state solution, etc. that were open to all and heavily policed and forced civility.   

Instead both sides were treated like pariahs on campus, which was some sort of a nod to fairness one supposes, but it's not what I would call fostering academic freedom.  It was pushing for there to be the always-destructive ""us vs them"" situation with law enforcement for anyone on any side of the issue who was demonstrating, protesting or counter-protesting.

The mob that attacked the encampment was in response to the violence of the encampment that had gone on unchecked. Prior to the Israeli mob showing up, many had been attacked. The final straw was when a female Jewish student was put in the hospital.

1cy5s46,l5d54c6,Jean_dodge67,"Such a tired argument.  The ""Jewish girl who was beaten unconscious"" was not ever unconscious, and she herself admits she doesn't know how she fell down, and hurt her own head but that she was doing so after trying to ""retrieve"" her Israel flag from inside the encampment.  That much is on video, her moving backwards from a line of protesters off balance rapidly. No one is visible hitting, shoving or kicking her, she's just falling back in a low crouch in the middle of what appears to be a mild skirmish line of arguing students lined up on the quad.  

TBH, many things are possible and she's not the one promoting the story of an assault on her.  
 
It sounds to me like she was harassing or beating the protesters inside their encampment, possibly assaulting them with a flagpole and someone snatched it away from her.  The rumor is that she was yanked backwards by her own friends (her own mother was with her and says she pulled her back from something) when she lunged into the encampment trying to retrieve her weapon/flag. The claim is also made that the protesters ""stomped on the flag of Israel"" when it seems likely they stood on it so she couldn't get it back, and she slipped when she lost her grip. She herself says she was in the process of retrieving her flag, but did not elaborate.  One can argue ""until the cows come home"" who was the aggressor, but it was clearly her who approached the (then-permited) pro-Palestine encampment for the purpose of verbally harassing the protesters.  And it's likely she did so with a mob of others who were physically attacking the police barriers separating the encampment from the counter-protesters' area.  

The incident went ""viral"" when it was inflated to some sort of vindictive and targeted hate-squad vigilante attack on her, which it clearly never was. She ""f*cked around and found out,"" that being openly confrontational and verbally abusive to other students can easily escalate into the physical realm but it then becomes difficult to say who instigated what actions. 

Whatever happened to her, the correct response was never to set a violent mob onto a protest encampment for four uninterrupted hours, employing explosives and bear spray and beating people with clubs and improvised weapons.",2,1716491166.0,t1_l5b828e

1cy5s46,l5iuunb,Jean_dodge67,"Feel free to show us the ""facts"" and proof of this ""reality"" you allude to without any supporting arguments or evidence.  

As far as I can figure out the ""Jewish girl knocked unconscious"" was part of a large group of the 4/28 demonstration, this was their big day with speakers lined up, etc. and a mass of demonstrators attacked the police bike rack barricades separating the two protest groups - they were the aggressors - the ""girl"" (who almost certainly is not a minor, and therefor a woman) was part of that mess.  If she was ""retrieving her lost flag"" what the hell was it doing in the protest encampment in the first place?  

Yes, she seems to have injured her head slightly, no staples or stitches required and nothing on the scan, not even the report of a concussion, but no one can produce any video of how exactly this occurred.  I just assume she yanked on the lost flag or flagpole that was on the ground in a scrum of confrontational people after HER SISTER lost control of it from likely beating someone with the item and was dumb enough to try to get it back.  Why was she in a confrontation with her sister and her mother by her side within any proximity to the pro-Palestinian demonstrators at all?  She makes no claim that they approached her, she was supposed to be at the Pro-Israel demonstration!!  

She was spoiling for a confrontation and whatever happened, it wasn't because she was peaceably demonstrating.  

The Pro-Palestinians were all clustered there that day on their side of police barricades in THEIR permitted encampment vicinity, and they either stepped on the lost flag on purpose or just because it was on the ground in a scrum of confrontational people, of which SHE, this ""Eleanor"" person was almost certainly one of the clear aggressors, and she yanked on it and lost her grip and fell backwards as others were yanking on the bike-rack barriers and she injured her own head.  Never does anyone claim she was struck on the head and THEN hit the ground.  her mother doesn't say that either. They want to claim she was kicked but it's not on video.  

If you crawl around on a disco dance floor, you a likely to get kicked in the head.  Give me a break.  She herself in this interview seems to indicate her head was injured when she struck the ground, not that anyone struck her at all.  She does not make that claim.  Where then is the ""assault?""  She seemingly instigated a confrontation and then foolishly tried to crawl around in a shoving match between political partisan demonstrators at the height of a planned confrontation where her side were the clear aggressors. She has no one but herself to blame.  

Watch the newscast where she and her non-credible seeming mother are interviewed.  IMO they act like they went to ""beat on the poors, as one does"" and were upset that their mink coats got muddy in the process.  

Starting at around 0:45 you get a sense of what was going on.  The pro-Isreal contingent is attacking the barricades set to separate the two groups. You don't get to pretend to be the victim when you are the aggressor.

Calling the pro-Palestinian, anti-war protestors ""pro-Hamas"" is a smear designed to demonize them (and legitimate violence against them). I was in the encampment multiple times and did not see or hear a single pro-Hamas message (and I was on the lookout for that).

Let me try to appeal to your Jewish identity. What happened on 4/28 and 4/30 is akin to the hatred and violence experience by our ancestors. Several incidents of alleged crimes, blown out of all proportion, were used to rile people up and incite violence. A group was demonized and collectively blamed for the actions of a few individuals, and then subjected to collective punishment. Doesn't that sound familiar?

That it was *Jews* in L.A. being swept up in a moral panic and turned into a mob is deeply ironic. It is also deeply bizarre that Zionist Jews were acting in concert with White nationalists (some of whom are antisemites) to violently attack the encampment on 4/30.

In this video, you can see her being pulled off her feet not in an assault but in an effort to separate her from some sort of confrontation that isn't clear.

The video is also edited, such that it begins with her in distress on the ground seemingly with a head injury.  There are more than one cut to re-arrange the sequence of actions.

* Protestors demanded police left so many withdrew further back 

* Middle of the night 1-3am - meaning gathering force took even longer

Yes you can.  Yes, you should. Grab the leaders, the instigators.  ""Half a dozen officers"" was never the real number.  When Thomas arrived at around midnight he had enough PRIVATE SECURITY to back up a ""flying squad"" of UCLA PD to rush in and start grabbing instigators. And he had LAPD and three other deepartements to assist.  

&gt; 12:00 UCLA police chief John Thomas told the Los Angeles Times that when he got to campus shortly before midnight, he saw 19 officers from campus police, the LAPD and three other local police departments, but an LAPD lieutenant told him the force was too small to step in.  (Wash post )  (how many LAPD and other departments?  We do not know)

THIS IS CORRUPT.

Welcome to U(CLA)valde.  Don't forget the hand sanitizer.  Cowards protecting cowards, corruptly.  

UCLA administers and chancellors left their students at the hands of a mob, abandoned them for hours and hours on April 30th, a date that shall live in infamy. They were left to die.  GENE BLOCK LEFT YOU TO DIE.  

Had, heaven forbid a student protester, faculty member or journalist been bludgeoned to death by outsider thugs on 4/30 their body would have lain on the grass in a no-man's land until dawn on May 1st.  And that was not the failure of one campus cop.  It's the failure of UCLA Chancellor Gene Block, that much is certain already.  It's his first responsibility as Chancellor - to protect, ensure and defend the Academic Freedom and personal safety of the people who are UCLA, the scholars, researchers and professors.  

Braziel reports solely and only to Chancellor Gene Block. Anything he's done is INTERNAL. And very much so.  All of this is predictable sad and non-accountable scandal-management and not a credible transparent action where accountability can be found with student and alumni oversight and input. 

The UCLA PD will investigate the UCLA PD.  Don't get cute and pretend anything other than this is happening.  And you can be certain will be very slow in these actions.  The main action here is to remove Thomas from any position where he can be asked questions and need to provide answers to the press and the students and the public.  They are silencing him.  

What this does tell us tho is that administrators KNOW there were provable massive failures that rise to a level ABOVE that of UCLA Police chief John Thomas' own failings.  They just hope to contain it at the root level and protect his bosses.

Above him is Vice-Chancellor in charge of security Beck.  Why is he also not suspended, and for that matter why not also suspend Gene Block?  

Because that's the first principle of fluid dynamics (and institutional politics) that sh*t rolls downhill.  

Either you have transparency and student oversight into these processes or you MUST assume they are corrupt unless and until proven otherwise.  The institutional credibility and public trust was lost by Chancellor Gene Block FIRST and FOREMOST and without transparency, and I'll say it again TRANSPARENCY, there can be no return of that public trust. 

GIVE TRANSPARENCY OR GET NO TRUST

And this is currently at issue in several of the lawsuits involving Uvalde.  The letter of the law dictates hat cops have no inherent duty to protect except where a ""special relationship"" exists between the person being attacked and the police, such as when the police have you in their custody.  There the legal argument will be, if any of the lawsuits ever reach trial, that the policy for students to shelter in place creates a special relationship where the police are supposed to enact an active shooter protocol and rush to ""stop the killing,"" since children are not instructed to run of campus and fend for themselves in the streets and alleys.  I'm expecting this same argument to resurface regarding UCLA on 4/30, given time and the impending litigation.    

But the real issue here is what is the duty of the university, which, since around 1050 AD have been established to foster, protect and enshrine academic freedom, the ability to challenge the basic ideas that form the status quo.  What is academic freedom but protected free speech on campus?

You're holding up their career, their pension their raise, etc.  and they don't have to give answers, (this is a free country) but they don't have to get off of suspension soon, either.  

Cops have a very powerful union and Chief Thomas will weather all this one way or another.  If push comes to shove and they want him fired, he will be allowed to resign or retire first. And then he will go work somewhere else in law enforcement.  

Beck is in total hiding.  The supplanting of his security position with the ""fixer"" Braziel was a clever move.  He's out of the spotlight but no one has admitted fault or failure here.  Were the ""investigation"" ( see no investigation myself) credible we would see beck placed on suspension and get answers from him, as Vice-chancellor in charge of campus security and oversight of the UCLA PD.  But IMO what we see is that the administration already KNOWS the answers Beck could provide and hopes to enter ask those questions at all.  When you don't have good answers to tough questions the best solution is to never ask those questions. 

Beck and Block have no answers at all that can excuse the failure to protect students from a violent mob assaulting them for 4 hours.  They own this.  It's their failure.  THEY HAVE NO ANSWERS.  The results speak for themselves, there is no excuse for what happened, only the good fortune that there were not 25 deaths instead of 25 sent to hospital.  

I don't care for Thomas but he has the excuse that he recommended to the administration that the encampment not be allowed in the first place.  That's fairly good stuff for his side. Also FWIW the violence did gradually ramp up from 4/25 to 4/29 until suddenly a few misleading videos went viral and chancellor Gene Block gave the order that the encampment was no longer permitted.  

That's on Block because it seemingly caused the mob to assemble hoping to both aid and watch the cops shut it all down.  Many were there to be spectators and they hoped to see the protesters be arrested by riot cops on 4/30.  But Gene Block knew all he needed to do was wait and the mob would give him the political cover to ""shut it down"" the next night.  It's just that no one expected the crowd to be so large and bloodthirsty. The Chancellors  created a monster, and then lost control of it.",1,1716417568.0,t1_l58mgag

1cy5s46,l58fkto,Jean_dodge67,"Note the major difference between the NYT report and the LA Times is that the LAT has an ""anonymous source"" that carries water for the chancellors and slings mud at the scapegoat, campus cop Thomas.  Anything he did or didn't do reflects directly on the failings of vice chancellor Beck and Gene Block.  

Do we seriously think that the LA Times reporter has a deep background personal source who is willing to give such an insider account about the call for Thomas to draw up written plans, and the business about the paperwork problems in securing outside (overtime) security from LAPD?  Who knows all these details and is deeply concerned but won't come forward and just say so in the open?  Those sorts of details are exactly the sort of thing a scandal management team would be interested in deliberately pushing into the media's hands.  

The media isn't so much complicit in the problems here, they are just outfoxed by some really well-paid and clever consultants.  We've simply had the requisite passage of time to see what a committee that's terrified of its own exposure to a scandal to come up with a scapegoat and decide where to wall off the tsunami of blame that is deserved all around. 

Of course the LA Times is going to read an email or have a phone call with someone offering an inside view.  But why havent these chancellors even had a single honest-to-god press conference if the problems here rise to the level of needing to suspend the chief of police?  

They are hiding inside a bunker.  Has anyone laid eyes on Rick Braziel or Gene Block in the last three weeks?  Vice-chancellor-in-exile Beck probably has his meals slid under the door.  And where is Beck, the vice-chancellor?  Will they attend graduations?  

Braziel is a front man who won't come out the front door.  I'm not sure he isn't hiding behind HIS bedroom door in Truckee.  We have seen zero proof he's set foot in Los Angeles county and why would he?  THERE ISN'T ANY WORK TO DO HERE if the task is to make sure time passes and no pubic records are released.

1ci7uzp,l2cxgtk,aoutis,"That‚Äôs just not true. Foreign policy is where republicans and democrats overlap the most - and even on this issue, they are not the same. Trump would be full-on sending US troops to crush Gazans. His son-in-law is on record talking about what a great business opportunity all that beachfront property is. There would for sure be no humanitarian aid. 

Domestically, Trump will almost certainly pass a national abortion ban (probably in the form of a 6- or 8-week ban), which means that California would not have the ability to keep it legal. The crazy stuff Abbott is doing in Texas that is killing immigrants on the border will likely be federal policy. Trump will probably repeal Biden‚Äôs climate bill, and US climate policy would take a gigantic step backward at a time when the earth and humanity cannot afford it. 

2 out of 3 liberal justices may not make it another 4 years, so a Trump win potentially gives republicans an 8-1 or 7-2 majority for decades to come. If that happens, say goodbye to gay marriage, birth control, protection of voting rights, and protest rights (because of a particularly scary case circulating in the 5th circuit). And that will just be in the first few years.

Obama deported because he was foolish and thought republicans would deal if he demonstrated a willingness to enforce. But I have several friends in immigration law and it got so much worse under Trump.

Wikipedia was in its infancy, AI didn't exist, Youtube tutorials didn't exist,and Google was not the powerhouse it is today. If you wanted to write a paper, there was no other option than visiting the library, spending hours looking for the relevant material, and spending even more time perusing each item scanning for useful information. 

Standards have also dropped dramatically since 2004. I'm only speaking for LAUSD but have heard similar things from teachers in other districts. They are pressured to keep failure rates low (and testing scores high) by offering endless extensions, extra credit, and limiting failing grades to 50% i.e. you turn in nothing but still get 50%. Sometimes the lowest grade possible in a class is a C. If you don't believe me reach out to some teachers or visit /r/teachers. 

Therefore, grade inflation in K-12 is rampant. 4.0 students with a ton of EC's are a dime a dozen. A 4.0 in 2004 would most likely get you into some Ivies and other top schools.

We may not have had AI, but we had everything else you listed. Google was a ""powerhouse"", possibly more so than today. There were also weighted GPAs and most UCLA admits had a 4.5 or above in high school.  A 4.0 wouldn't have gotten you into UCLA, let alone an ivy. We had just as much information as your generation does, we just had to access it on a computer instead of a phone. 

What I think has changed the most is the level of competitiveness. Going to college has become more of an expectation now, and students are increasingly aiming for top colleges rather than going to a Cal State and commuting. Back then, most people might have applied for 2-4 colleges, now 6 or more is not uncommon. So with the larger number of applications, acceptance rate will go down.

I'm not sure what UCB's doing, but they're the only ones who have accepted less students this year as compared to the previous year. In fact I'll do a table like u/Lazy_Log6844 for the admits in 2023:

So most of the UCs had significant increases of those accepted in 2024 v. 2023, except for UCLA which had a smaller increase and UCB which reduced its accepted class by \~ 1,000. In 2022 and 2023, UCLA accepted \~ 2,000 less students than B.

I was just trying to figure out what B was doing. Because if they have the same yields for the incoming 2024 class as it had in 2023, which would be 48% for CA residents, 29% for OOS, and 53% for Internationals (yes, the latter yields are &gt; than in-state residents), then they would admit an incoming class of \~ 6,100-6,200, which would be significantly lower than their previous class of 6,641 for 2023.

Here are B's and UCLA's comparison of admits for 2024 and 2023 of the residential cohorts:

Reddit won't allow me to do another table.

B's differential regarding resident cohorts is

CA Students, -210

OOS, -350

Internationals, -416

UCLA's differential regarding resident cohorts is:

CA Students, +208

OOS, +109

Internationals, 75

It's possible that UCLA's yields have dropped; otherwise it could be expecting a class of 6,700-6,800, which would be its largest ever -- not a good idea. B has admitted nearly 7,000 at times in the recent past, and SD admits typically 7,000/year. \[Edit:\] Let me add that UCLA's yields for the three resident cohorts were 61% for CA residents, 33% for OOS students, both higher than B's, and 35% for Internationals (as compared to B's 53%).",3,1722717959.0,t1_lgcqsb6

As a hiring manager, I would prefer a candidate with a CS degree simply because the chance of me making a good hiring decision is higher (i.e., the variance in candidate quality is much narrower because universities already did a pre-selection for me).

Does that mean there are no good and smart candidates from boot camp? Of course not, but the variance of talent quality is much wider, and I would be more likely to make a bad hiring decision from that talent pool.

Same thing can be said about UCLA vs. other nearby universities. It's not the education quality that matters as much.

One thing that we had at that time that does not exist today was affirmative action, which made it somewhat easier for people from underrepresented and underserved groups to be admitted.

Also, applying to college was much more labor intensive. You had to write or type your applications by hand, and you could not do virtual tours via Google Earth. You had to visit colleges in person or read the brochures. The Internet as we know it today did not exist. Places like UCSB and UCSC and UCD were considered safeties for those with rather high GPAs and strong applications.
USC was 70 percent admissions rate.

Now UCLA is at the level of Dartmouth and Penn in terms of admissions, and has a lower admissions rate than West Point and the USAF Academy.

And it became just as difficult to enter as Mexico City‚Äôs  UNAM (around 8 percent admissions rate). And over there they don‚Äôt care about your extracurricular activities or hardships or factors outside grades. The only thing that matters over there is your score on its entrance exam (for those who came from high schools not affiliated with the university).

If you gained admissions to one of its 14 affiliated high schools, which are FIERCELY competitive to get into (over there you take a citywide placement exam at the end of middle school and have to select about 10 high school campuses you want to attend, and you are placed in one of them based on your performance-your place of residence is not considered), the university looks at your overall GPA and whether or not you failed any classes or if you completed HS in three years. It‚Äôs because they have what is known as a ‚Äúregulated pass.‚Äù Let‚Äôs say you want to go to law or medicine. If your GPA is near perfect or perfect, you are guaranteed admission to  these careers at UNAM without taking the entrance exam. If it‚Äôs not high enough you can take the exam.

At the end of the day the goal of the protest is not to build further sympathy with other students and the public. They already have enough of that. The goal is to make the protest painful enough for the admin to capitulate, and they are very galvanized after the encampment shutdown. I think admin is only going to get further galvanized in their position by the continual disruption though. It's a game of chicken and I can't really predict who will win at this point.

UCLA initially led with giving protestors the benefit of the doubt.  They allowed what they acknowledged were unauthorized encampments.  This bit them in the ass and got *far* worse when police intervention dragged and allowed students and protestors to be assaulted by counter-protestors.

Now, UCLA has overcorrected with stern police presence and incredibly cautious decision making to prevent the protest from once again growing.  The demands for ""WHERE ARE THE POLICE?"" from last week were *loudly* met, and now many of the same folks are saying ""There's too many police!""  That's now how this works.  They aren't a push of the button, immediate incident response when it comes to potential large scale problems.

Now it seems the ""solution"" for those who want to support the protestors and simply blame UCLA is for UCLA to make concessions.  Unfortunately, they are under no obligation to do so.  What they *are* obligated to do is try to get their functions and facilities back up and running, and should protestors continue to try to impede or threaten that, they have every right to start suspending, expelling, and/or arresting those who are non-compliant.  To argue that UCLA not meeting demands is the reason for these disruptions continuing is just willfully ignoring the protestors very deliberate actions, and intent to disrupt the lives of others to get UCLA to bend.",28,1715047836.0,t1_l2vw7f9

1clqlie,l3hzy8n,Jean_dodge67,"Sure, that's why the demands of most campus protesters everywhere include ""Divulge and divest.""    The Vox explainer on divestment covers most of this well.  It gets squishy fast with a lot of ways to see it all, but the overall political aim is to focus attention and condemnation of the state of Israel however possible since they are, you know, bombing women and children at a considerable pace here.  A protest group doesn't have to win all their demands to make a positive change.  Rome wasn't built in a day, but if you start building a cathedral, others tend to jump in to help if they are as devout as you are.  We live in a nation that condoned slavery and also banned liquor for a decade.  Many things are possible when you organize and make weird demands.  

Issues surrounding this stuff include the fact that a great many colleges DID ""divest and divulge"" from apartheid-era South Africa and more recently to move away from fossil fuel investments in deference to ""climate change"" issues and related protest demands. Then you get into, if they do ""divest in supporting Isreal"", when can they re-invest in Israel, or war profiteering, or defense industry, etc?  When wars cease, or when we get a ceasefire, a two-state solution, what?  It's possible the protesters don't yet have all these answers but that doesn't mean they shouldn't assume they might not see some progress by doing so.  

In order to negotiate, first you have to be granted a seat at the table, so a considerable amount of the protest is just concerning that. All the past times regents listened to demands to divulge and divest opens up the door for, do students have a say in where their tuition money gets parked or not?  Another deep topic, viewpoints vary.  If you bought a used bicycle from me, do you then get the right to tell me what drugs I get to spend the cash money on, (lol) or is the money now mine to do with as I see fit?  Or, is a university a group thing and we are all stakeholders, with rights, etc?  And so on. 

If I enrolled in clown college and later found out all my tuition money went to Ted Cruz's Mexico-bound vacations and that lady who shoots puppies I might not come back next semester.

You do realize you are in a dwindling minority that considers protest useless.  Clearly the administration is terrified and running scared.

I‚Äôm genuinely curious to know what you think about the destruction and blockade of parts of the school, versus a protest that was actually a peaceful demonstration? I‚Äôm 100% in alignment with you about not sitting on the sidelines while the world burns, which is actually how I ended up at UCLA myself. I changed my career because there are too many urgent needs in the world than to focus just on oneself (my passion is climate). Anyway, I love and support activism. I consider myself a long-time activist. As long as living beings are not hurt, I do not give a shit about protecting physical structures of corporations. I‚Äôm staunchly anti-violent myself, but I admit that there are certain situations/ methods of protest that I may low key support, especially against entities like big polluters (only talking physical structures here). However, (this is just my experience), with regard to UCLA, this school has been the vehicle for me to gain the tools I‚Äôll need to do my little part to make the world a better place. That‚Äôs my intention. And I see that desire in so many people on campus, including many faculty. So, when I see certain language used in graffiti which isolates or scares a separate, innocent group(s) of students, who are just trying to go to school, I‚Äôm just wondering if you believe that is necessary to achieve the desired outcome.

Society's failings seldom change without serious disruptions.  Some spray paint however was less than nothing compared to what the IDF is doing in Gaza to women, children and unarmed men.  Unless these protests pushed the Chancellor and regents and administration to the brink of decisive action, what would the result have been?  A campout, that was ignored.  Youth and passion for a cause can almost easily be portrayed from the outside as frivolous or misguided or over the line in places.  But at the core, UCLA invests heavily in defense industry manufacturing, your tuition money helps fund the bombs raining on Palestine.  You are, in that way, arguably complicit in a genocide.  The only real question is , ""what now must we do?""  Disrupt or stay silent and complicit?  Do you realize how seldom wars are stopped by a civilian population?  And how terrible war is?  Being polite is not what will accomplish this goal.  Nearly  a thousand faculty members have signed a letter supporting the protesters and their demands.  15,000 children in Gaza have been murdered and you are worrying about a gardener's paycheck for a week.

This is all happening NOW.  You can sit on the sidelines of history or you can choose a side.  The side opposing the protesters allowed a vigilante mob to beat and assault the protesters for five hours as cops from every agency stood down.  People could have died.

My support kinda faded when in person and in Reddit if you didn‚Äôt already 100% support the cause you were relegated to being *against them*.    


I literally tried to just get more information (in person at the encampment/and with classmates who are pro-Palestine) because the entire situation is very complex, tangled up in laws and treaties, and very polarising if on the inside‚Ä¶ I was not given a warm welcome to conversation in both cases‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve only witnessed on here that if you have anything to say that may not even be against the protest, it could just be a personal opinion like this post, you get downvoted to hell.    


The fact that the ‚Äúnegotiation‚Äù was just a scream fest was also a reason I started fade with support. I witnessed the entire thing, I get it‚Äôs a movement with very heavy emotional investment but negotiations are conversations that are not just yelling at the person. AND DEFINITELY don‚Äôt result in a mod mentality to forcefully hold a person against their will(I‚Äôm glad the what seem to be leaders? Of the protest shut that down hard because that would have been an even worse ending to the encampment). The vice chancellor was doing active listening which is why he would be saying ‚Äúyeah‚Äù or ‚Äúmhmm‚Äù and it drive me crazy they yelled at him for that. Active listening involves acknowledging what the other person is saying, it‚Äôs pretty involuntary, and is what good listeners do to show ‚Äúhey I am hearing everything you‚Äôre saying, I‚Äôm paying attention to your words‚Äù. But I get not everyone see active listening like that.   


I personally feel that the protestors are pushing support from fellow students away. If you genuinely want to hear what they have to say because you don‚Äôt have a fully formed stance yet, *‚Äùwell you must be against us and shame on you‚Äù*. I do not blame the encampment protesters for the violence that was attracted to them whatsoever. But even when someone said the violence towards them was bad and unacceptable, and also acknowledge what they were doing wasn‚Äôt necessarily peaceful protest(graffiti, property damage, blocking free movement, blasting police with objects/liquids/fire extinguishers, harsh language at anyone they disagree with(which btw ‚Äúfrom the river to the sea‚Äù is a phrase made by hamas indicating the desire to eradicate the entirety of the Isreal people via killing then all‚Äî- and drawing a Star of David with the phrase ‚Äústep here‚Äù on it is hateful rhetoric), stopping the purpose of the university, attempted kidnapping of vice chancellor), you get labeled as the enemy.    


Peaceful protest is what it was in the first couple days. Music, free movement of the student body, using signs and chalk, willing to let fellow student join the cause or get information. UCLA is a public school, an open campus, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there are not laws/rules/policies for what occurs in the campus. If random people came onto campus and spray painted on buildings, guess what? Thats illegal-&gt; arrests can be made.   


 I understand what happened with the counter-protesters was unacceptable and yes the police should have at least done something before they had the ‚Äúright numbers‚Äù I agree 100% and those people should have been and still need to be arrested and tried for their crime. There should not have been the allowance for that kind of violence to occur. Honestly the amount of actual police that were there before the rest showed up should have set up post on either side to ensure what happened didn‚Äôt even have the chance to happen. But even if they had done a preventative measure like that, there still would have been chants to oppose the police presence. You cannot have it both ways. You can‚Äôt demand the police to help you, but as soon as they do start chanting about how you hate them and they need to go home. Had the police left I 100% bet anything the people who assaulted the encampment would have came right back, and the cycle of ‚Äúhelp us! Wait go away‚Äù would have continued. There is no response the school could have done and it please everyone.    


There is such an entitlement and superiority complex occurring in the encampment side. You are privileged. You have the privilege to protest, to fly a pride flag, to have access to education, access to food(if you live off campus there is a very high chance for being eligible for cal-fresh), access to housing (UCLA has 4&amp;2 year housing guarantee depending on transfer or freshman entrance). You are a privileged individual in relation to those you are protesting for. Understand that there are a lot of thing you support/do, and who you are(especially those of us who are lgbtq+) would be result in instantly being prosecuted(k**led) for by the people you are protesting for. There is an air of superiority because the rhetoric indicates that only the encampment protesters could possibly stop this war. If every country that supported Isreal via aid packages stopped, the war would still continue. If there was a cease fire TODAY, the pro-Palestine crowd would take ALL credit even though the local countries to the area have been working towards a ceasefire for a long time. *A very long time*. 


I support freedom to protest. I support the pro-Palestine protestors right to protest. I don‚Äôt have to be 100% on their ‚Äúside‚Äù to support their right to protest and believe that they should be allowed to protest. I don‚Äôt have to be 100% on their ‚Äúside‚Äù to agree that the violence that was done into them was a horrendous occurrence. I don‚Äôt have to be on anyone‚Äôs ‚Äúside‚Äù to detest war and the deaths of innocent civilians.

1clqlie,l35lu8m,Bruinsamedi,I appreciate your reply to me.  Thank you.,1,1715187796.0,t1_l33evne
1clqlie,l35umlb,Jean_dodge67,"You're welcome.  Back in the 1960s these sorts of discussions took place on college campuses in person for hours and hours, often becoming all-day affairs leading deep into the night.  But everyone had a chance to speak and be heard and they then moved from consensus, not from a simple democratic majority and the strongest rhetoric of the moment that fed to passionate and upset students.  The faculty got involved, too and big decisions were made regarding the shape, intent and nature of protest.  

The universities learned to counter these protests a hundred and one ways, and to use ""soft power"" to control crowds and infiltrate student movements and to manipulate the media and use public relations techniques, and so on and so on to where we are today, when it's very difficult to use protest at all, as you are mentioning.  

A lot of the ""divest now"" talk is already accepted and understood within the protest movement that it won't lead to radical change - these giant institutions are VERY set in their ways and have seriously entrenched power that is protected in a million ways that an undergraduate will never penetrate, but the basic optics of the many student protests DOES get seen, and does affect the body politic and the overall awareness of the general public worldwide.  The basic message is, stop the War in Gaza.  By any means necessary, stop the killing.  

Let's face it the, CHP Special Operations Unit riot cops pushed the students off the lawn like they were using a leaf blower on dry leaves. And, like it or not, they didn't have to kill or main anyone too seriously to do it, which is some measure of safety achieved.  

In NYC, they stopped the occupation of ""Hinds Hall"" at Columbia and they marched over the protesters at UT and a lot of other places quite easily but it still made the news and it still delivered a message. And what didn't happen is business as usual with no pushback at all and no wider awareness that students oppose this war in enough numbers to be heard.  And a lot of important and still outstanding questions were raised about what constitutional rights to free speech and assembly mean once a student passes through a gate onto a college campus, be it private or public.  

The mass arrests in parking Lot 2 were in some ways a much bigger deal than the riot cops pushing students out of the encampment.  That was seemingly a clear case of prior restraint and over-reaction for which there can be little defense.  It took five hours to come up with at least four different excuses for the arrests, and it seems rather obvious that what really happened is that the university moved in a ""proactive"" fashion to kettle the vanguard of a planned sit in by using blatantly illegal tactics but they achieved their goal.  And this showed us all again what a university is willing to do and not do when the spotlight is on.  (The spotlight was NOT on the mass arrests in the parking lot, although that's too bad.) 

It's all very educational, for the students who haven't experienced this before and for the faculty who have, and for the public that may or may not have even been aware there was a war in Gaza.",3,1715190808.0,t1_l35lu8m
1clqlie,l361mc5,Bruinsamedi,Well written! You may want to write this to the Daily Bruin as a letter to the editor.,2,1715193209.0,t1_l35umlb
1clqlie,l369wcb,Jean_dodge67,"Thanks for the compliment but there is a reason that protesters on college campuses are increasingly NOT pandering to the local or mainstream media anymore, and opting instead to carry their message ""directly to the people"" using social media platforms.  It's a dangerous game that all sides are playing now, but it's how the game is shifting, like it or not.  

If you read the news, there has been an ongoing push to demand that president Biden sit down for an interview with the ""newspaper of record,"" the New York Times and the White House message is that Biden ""prefers to speak directly to the people."" (He hasn't done. major interview of this sort for over 4 months now and that used to not be the case for presidents, on the whole.)   Look at how his opponent Trump prefers to keep his followers ""inside a bubble.""  

It's a distressing situation but on the whole, authorities have learned how to manipulate the mainstream media because both sides need one another.  In my mind, the administration of UCLA has utterly lost the public trust and are not acting in a credible fashion in addressing the twin failures of 4/30 and the mass arrests in parking lot #2. We deserve full transparency concerning these incidents but instead get PR spin and scandal management only. It's corrupt, IMO.  

But the media will NEVER say that outright, they WILL NOT call any prominent official ""corrupt"" when it's clear they are. By carrying water for the institutions, which will likely remain institutions no matter how poorly they are administered, over listening and responding to the people or protesters they admit that they draw legitimacy from such acts.  Mainstream news has become a for profit industry as it always has been, but so much so that the sacred mission of being ""the 4th estate"" is mostly lost.  

The difficulty is, only large media orgs like the New York Times have the resources and the depth to do investigative journalism at all anymore.  But their strength and the strength of the talented reporters who forged career-long connections within government and industry are fading.  Senior reporters are given buyout and taking early retirement as newspapers and magazines fold and the hedge funds that run them demand cost cuts that reflect the loss in advertising revenue and circulation.  If people all get their news from TikTok, well, why bother with the middleman and why not just go be an influencer on TicTok, says everyone from ""save the whales"" to ""let's save Hitler's brain and hook it up to a robot dog with a machine gun and kill the lizard people, Taylor Swift fans and the Rothchilds.""  It's terrible that people like Steve Bannon recognize that it's wining tactic to ""flood the zone with sh*t"" but guess what, it's the ONLY ZONE worth visiting.  The upside argument for all this is that we are all free citizens and can decide for ourselves what is important, true and real and don't need weathermen to tell us which way the wind blows.  Sadly, I've read wikipedia entries that were more useful to me than an entire semester of classes on some topics, depending on the quality of the teaching and the materials presented.  If I sound cynical it's because the world has made so.  

There's never  been a better time to be a corrupt local or state official.  The normal channels of reporting that would hold people accountable have been too eroded to trust.  We live in perilous times, and for better or worse this social media post may get just as many views as anything carried in the Daily Bruin.  I tend to think the truth has a way of rising to the surface, not that I claim to know the sole truth of anything here.

Do the protesters hav a right to free speech or not, and where does that right end?  They see the war in Gaza as a genocide, and therefore something worth causing a stir so that it cannot be ignored. If you feel you should have the right to be able to ignore the situation in Gaza, and go about your life without concern, where does that leave the people of Gaza, are they citizens, gods or beasts?  

And what is your responsibility to others, if any?  Some would say no one is free unless we are all free.  Do you want freedom, or do you want security at the expense of other people's freedom?  

And so on.  It may not be an argument you care to have at the moment, but the University has an answer - they think students with messages they disagree with - divesting in enterprises that make a profit from the war in Gaza, for example, do not deserve a voice in this matter.  The protesters disagree.  But by doing nothing, you end up enabling the administration to shut down on dissent, and retain the power to marginalize anyone they disagree with.  So the question  becomes, are they the Gods and the students the beasts, and are there no real citizens at all?  

Of course there is always nuance deeper than such basic philophical questions but a great many protesting students who are willing to face m violence and arrest, expulsion and worse are putting their bodies on the line hoping everyone will ask themselves these questions and not remain on the sidelines of an historical moment of great importance to the nation, and of greater importance to the people of Gaza who are suffering both under the presence of Hamas and under the bombs of Israel.

The movement has changed the debate on support for Israel in the US and the wider public is much more aware of divestment as a demand than they were in the early 2010s when BDS started to take off in the US.

Many more people are aware that universities across the country have investments in weapons manufacturers, something that universities don't seem to want people to know and certainly don't want to entertain as something to be negotiated by their students, faculty, or staff. 

More people now think that the main aim of universities is not to educate students or to perform research, but to perpetuate their existence through investments and real estate purchases, to expand itself as a self-sustaining business. 

The movement is now at colleges and universities around the country, far bigger than in the start of the year when it was really only at Columbia and a few other schools.

1crg7ql,l55h3e5,[deleted],"Genocide = mass murder typically based on the ethnicity of the population being targeted but also it is further motivated by the resources that are available when said group of people are gone. An example: the Native American genocide, sure most died from small pox or being forced onto the trail of tears, but they eradicated a large amount of a specific  ethnicity so that they could lay claim to the land and resources they were living on at the time. Palestinians have been then exponentially longer and Jewish people were expelled by the Roman empire. The Jewish people that remained were a small minority of people. starting with the British mandate, Israel was established, and they continued to take more and more land from them. Cornering them into smaller and smaller reservations, continually hoping to at one point be the owners of all the land since they're are already bombing/murdering the rest of the civilians living there indiscriminately. 

There also is no limits on the amount of civilian casualties that they're allowed, doesn't matter if they kill 10+ innocent people in an ambulance convoy, it's okay bc they killed 1 (one) Hamas soldier!! They also have bombed multiple aid convoys, have weaponized sexual violence for longer than Hamas have had allegations dating back to the Safsaf massacre of 1948 I believe (it is anywhere from 1948-1952 it's been a long day and I'm not Google further information rn) 

Other than, the main reasoning is that they're indiscriminately bombing civilian targets with a response that Is extremely unproportional compared to the Oct 7th attacks, they use Hamas as an excuse to murder thousands and thousands of civilians. They could have totally taken out hamas without bombing Palestine to the ground, but they decide to go scorched earth bc it serves their purpose of eradicating all the inhabitants of the land they have been stealing over the past (nearly) 100 years. If you don't see genocidal intent it seems you are being wilfully obtuse, what Is your definition of genocide?  

You could compare it to the Holocaust tbh, a big part of blaming the jews and non-aryans was that Germany needed a bad guy/boogeyman to unite the country together against a common enemy jews (or in the case of palestine, using Hamas as a catch all for any Palestinians). The Germans also had a large amount of economic prosperity during WW2 so eliminating this population further seemed benefit them with material gains (with palestine they gain land). So it's really a genocide tbh, it's comparable to both the native American genocide and Holocaust. I would argue that massive bombing campaigns that primarily focus on civilian targets all in the name of 'defeating Hamas' (or in the case of WW2 defeating the non-aryans)  would qualify as genocide. 

Remember, Oct 7th is in response to a long long line of aggression coming from Israel, hell, there could've been a working 2 state solution in 1995 if they followed the Oslo Accords which stated that Israel would cease all operations that challenge the status of Palestine, but they continued settling Palestinian land. That would be seen as an act of aggression anywhere else in the world, if Russia started settling Florida, it would be seen as aggression, why Is it unreasonable for Palestinians to attempt to fight back when they were the target of extreme aggression, colonization, and currently extreme bombing campaigns that do not take civilian casualties into mind. They have the idea that 100 dead civilians but 1 dead Hamas soldier makes it worth it.

Edit: there also have been whistleblowers regarding the Palestinian concentration camps, where medical torture such as amputation happens, people are tortured, etc etc I

1crg7ql,l58rdiy,araja_abbado,"&gt;what Is your definition of genocide

I think we agree on the definition, but we disagree on what it means exactly. Genocide requires the intention to specifically destroy a race/ethnicity of people (due to their membership of the group). Killing a lot of members of a race/ethnicity fulfills the physical component, but not necessarily the nonphysical component (or else most wars fought against a particular race/ethnicity of people would be considered genocide). I consider the ICJ's standard of proof, which is that the evidence is ""fully conclusive"" (there is no other plausible explanation). But considering that Israel is in a war, I don't think that their actions fall into being ""fully conclusive"" of a genocide.

&gt;massive bombing campaigns that primarily focus on civilian targets all in the name of 'defeating Hamas'

Targeting ""civilian"" infrastructure is different from targeting civilians. Before the start of Israel's operation, it gave warning to civilians to evacuate, and Israel also makes use of humanitarian corridors for civilians. This would probably not be done in a genocide.

&gt;there could've been a working 2 state solution in 1995 if they followed the Oslo Accords which stated that Israel would cease all operations that challenge the status of Palestine, but they continued settling Palestinian land

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs quite true; there were a lot of issues that were around at the time of both Oslo I and Oslo II. Fatah agreed to the 1993 Oslo Accords, but Hamas rejected them. So, Hamas engaged in attacks/ suicide bombings from 1993 to 1996. Arafat (leader of PLO/PA) did not pursue the attackers .

&gt;""Israelis killed in terrorist attacks‚Äìbetween 1993 and 1996 about 300 Israelis were assassinated by suicide squads... Terrorism undermined the legitimacy and the moral foundations of the peace process. Neither Arafat nor Rabin \[prime minister of Israel\] was now in a position to give the other the minimum required to keep Oslo alive.""

(source: Scars of War, Wounds of Peace page 216)

&gt;which stated that Israel would cease all operations that challenge the status of Palestine, but they continued settling Palestinian land

I am pretty sure this is not true. It is my understanding that neither Oslo I nor Oslo II discuss the Israeli settlements even though they had planned to discuss the issue more soon after (along with many other issues) but did not due to things breaking down after the assassination of Rabin and the attacks by Hamas, I believe. For example, the 1993 Accords say:

&gt;settlements, specified military locations, Palestinian refugees, borders, foreign relations and Israelis; and ... powers and responsibilities not transferred to the Council.

(source: 1993 Oslo Accords). Similarly, to my knowledge, they didn't discuss the very contentious issue of Palestinian refugees and the right to return.

&gt;there also have been whistleblowers regarding the Palestinian concentration camps, where medical torture such as amputation happens, people are tortured, etc etc I

It is disgusting and horrifying that these camps exist, and it‚Äôs insane that this is happening. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way to argue that the stuff they do (that CNN reported) would NOT be a violation of some part of the Geneva Conventions (III or IV). With all this being said, comparing these to ‚Äúconcentration camps‚Äù of the Holocaust is also kind of disgusting in my opinion. The concentration camps were a result of the Nazis‚Äô policy of industrialized mass murder, and there is just zero evidence for Israelis engaging in a similar practice. From what I‚Äôve found, the largest estimated number of deaths says ‚Äúat least [27](https://www.972mag.com/sde-teiman-torture-prisoners/).‚Äù I don‚Äôt dismiss the possibility that we may, in the future, have evidence that Israel was committing mass murder on these prisoners, but there is zero evidence for this at the moment. In my opinion, the stuff that could be happening (but we just don‚Äôt know about) in these camps could be the most persuasive argument for genocide - but the problem is that we don‚Äôt exactly know the extent of what‚Äôs going on in there. Until the evidence comes out, it is seriously irresponsible to say that these are ‚Äúconcentration camps.‚Äù You cannot argue genocide based on evidence that we don‚Äôt have. From what we do know, these camps are disgusting and (in my opinion) a violation of international law, but that doesn‚Äôt constitute a genocide.",2,1716418665.0,t1_l58rckg

But I doubt very much that volunteer services \*alone\* are effective for tracking down rapists and putting them into custody.  You have to realize that at UCLA, there are prominent voices in the faculty and in the student body who call for the total abolition of police on campus, and who consider video surveillance systems to be a human rights violation. The UCLA campus is a hotbed of such utopian wishful thinking, completely unmoored from the realities of real public safety systems. As you can guess, I am a critic of that strand of thinking at UCLA. I believe that a fusion of community level services as exists in all human communities -- looking out for one another -- ""seeing something and saying / doing something"" is a good idea PLUS a well funded and trained police force. That is the right way forward. I am not arguing that volunteer services are not good for some tasks, or as a complement to policing. The argument I am making is this: volunteer services alone, or student-run services alone, are a bad idea, and police are needed. This is just common sense in the wider world, but trust me, this is considered a radical or even ""fascist"" opinion at UCLA. UCLA social science and humanities departments in particular are distorted bubbles of far-left groupthink, rife with social-justice / woke / ""defund the police"" ideology. There are also common sense mature adults at UCLA of all stripes (ethnicity, gender, political affiliation, religious beliefs, etc.) who feel otherwise, and understand the realities of public safety. But these voices are not unified or as vocal as the ""defund the police"" contingent whose academic identities are fused to this kind of activist ideology.

I agree they should come humbly and in a position of understanding, since we were all once sinners, but the truth of the gospel will still feel harsh to people.

And (not to say that the prideful people misrepresenting Christianity are right) in those unfortunate cases, the negative image of Christianity matters less than the person coming to a full understanding of the gospel and being able to go investigate its truth. 

So, ultimately, Christians can evangelize through a good example and actions, but it is equally important to spread it by word of mouth, the Internet, etc!",-3,1733373637.0,t1_m0hnyja

The prodigal son parable is not meant to be a message to not evangelize: it's a message of the love and comfort God will provide to those who confess and turn away from their sins and commit to Him. Jesus issued the the Great Commission to the disciples and all us believes in Matthew 28:19-20: Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,¬†baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,¬†and teaching¬†them to obey everything I have commanded you.

We dont have such experiences.

To assume that he is talking directly to us, to ASSUME we are at their level is peak pride. And when we evangelize the way the prideful do, what are our fruits? The fruit will speak for our actions.

We smear the face of jesus with feces. Jesus mocked the pharisees and accepted the prostitutes that came to him (i think a lot of us assume we are not pharisees).

That's a really interesting point of view that it's prideful to assume we're at the  level of the disciples. Like you said, they sinned as well through their betrayal and also because they were human like us. Even the great apostle Paul called himself the worst of sinners, telling us that he is in no way above us.

Yes, Jesus accepted the prostitute that came to him, but also told her to ""Go, and sin no more."" It's more prideful to think that you shouldn't spread the gospel because you think it offends Jesus; Jesus was the greatest evangelist (and more) ever!!",2,1733375468.0,t1_m0hrkth

1fbdk6m,llzr3nl,BatManatee,"TL;DR - Since like 1980, UCLA has leased land from the VA for their baseball stadium. The land must be used to ""principally benefit veterans and their families"".

Originally, there was a lot of empty space on the VA campus, so I think the argument was: money from UCLA's lease and facilities that the veterans can use is benefitting them more than an empty lot. But the West LA site has taken a lot of heat for these leases and litigation on the issue started in 2011, and has had some shady dealings in the past. 

Now with a much worse housing situation, and homeless veterans that need support, the leases are much more problematic. So, it's hard to argue with the ruling, IMO. Caring for homeless veterans of course is more important than a baseball stadium. 

It's unclear what this will mean for UCLA baseball. Will the stadium be scraped? Would UCLA try to find an on campus site for a stadium? Expand the softball stadium somehow to accommodate both teams, though there's not much space there?",91,1725734059.0,t3_1fbdk6m

Do veterans not have kids and/or grandkids? There is not one playground in the whole campus (or park-like atmosphere for people to enjoy). There is not one museum on campus dedicated to the wars our veterans fought that can employ vets and teach the public and school kids our history. 

The land around the VA hospital south of wilshire is in a sea of surface lots with a super valuable subway line terminating there connecting it to the rest of the city. The South campus is also much more integrated with the surrounding neighborhood. Why not build thousands of housing units around there to house homeless vets and provide subsidized housing as well to other vets?

The city of LA lacks a truly grand park like other world class cities have (a la central park, golden gate park, balboa park). Why not have botanical gardens, greenhouses etc (all things that are proven to be therapeutic for vets dealing with trauma and jobs to employ other vets) scattered throughout the campus to make it something people want to visit? 

LA should have its ""Veterans Park"" run by vets for vets and all city residents.

If this can be packaged into a project of beautifying the city as a whole AND providing jobs, housing, and help to vets I think there could be so much less pushback against all the NIMBYs.

1fv2exv,lq4uczs,DevelopmentRoyal4152,"Here‚Äôs some advice from an alum (Anthropology (B.A.) &amp; Psychology (B.A.)) who transferred into UCLA during the peak of the pandemic:

1. Get involved if you haven‚Äôt already. Networking, building letters of recommendation, and acquiring unique social experiences will help shape the ease of your transition into the workforce or graduate school. Don‚Äôt waste your last year. 


2. Upskill. It took me 6 months to find a job after graduating and that was working at Eataly as a Market Sales Associate making $17/hour. If you‚Äôre pursuing a non-STEM degree take coursework that you can build analytical/research skills as it is unanimously advantageous across all industries to have these as an employee. Also, don‚Äôt just take the class to take the class, but rather reshape how you problem solve. 

3. Apply to internships for spring or jobs early. As I previously mentioned, it took me 6 months to find a job w/ two bachelors from the #1 public university. I waited until after I graduated to start applying to places, of which, I received an offer for an embarrassingly low skill position.

4. Stay optimistic. There‚Äôs a lot of competition out there, but no one has your worldview and perspective on life. Use it to your advantage.

Honorable Mention: invest early and often when you graduate. Learn what a ROTH IRA is and learn what time value of money is. These tools somewhat level the financial playing field for gen z.

First of all, I‚Äôm glad that ucla is doing a much better job of handling this situation and not siccing the cops on protestors like at other campuses. And I think u/bw_throwaway has already given a great summation of the issues with these terms, but I want to say a bit more:

Calls to ‚Äúglobalize the intifada‚Äù are calls for violence against Jews, whether the speaker understands it as such or not. I understand that if you‚Äôre a non-Jewish college kid you might not intend it to have that meaning, but Jewish people are feeling tired of trying to divine what‚Äôs inside the hearts of people chanting for their death. When white nationalists and Republicans use racist dog-whistles, we don‚Äôt hem and haw over what they really mean in their heart of hearts; the only thing vulnerable minorities know is the rhetoric that is being used which endangers their lives. We listen to minorities who know a dog-whistle when there is one, because they‚Äôve lived with that their entire lives. They see the implicit biases that the majority is blind to. Why should that not apply to Jews? If the answer is ‚Äúbecause some right wing Israelis weaponize claims of antisemitism to commit war crimes‚Äù that is not good enough. As a progressive movement, you have an obligation to be inclusive of diverse voices, and listen to their concerns, and engage in good-faith. If you answer bad faith with bad faith, you are no better than the movement you are opposing. Similarly, *some* people saying ‚Äúfrom the river to the sea‚Äù might mean it as a peaceful chant, but others aren‚Äôt. Jewish people hearing it as a call for their family to be murdered are not Zionist hasbara shills (even if pro-Israel propagandists do exist). 

What I am seeing happening at these encampments is a movement that can‚Äôt be bothered to include or listen to a tiny, historically persecuted minority. When Jews speak out about this language we are accused of ‚Äútone policing.‚Äù You might call it tone policing but I call it my life and safety. A movement that can‚Äôt be inclusive of people trying to engage in good-faith, that no longer strives to universalism and containing within it diverse groups and life experiences is not ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù or ‚Äúleft-wing‚Äù in any meaningful sense of that word. 

But even worse than that: it‚Äôs not just the people saying it, but the sanctioning of it and looking the other away, and the self-righteous disbelief that ‚Äúanyone on my side‚Äù could possibly engage in Jew-hatred or do anything bad. What I see are people so certain of their own virtue that they cannot see the environment of intolerance that is being fomented. No one would ever tolerate these calls of violence against a minority at any other kind of social justice protest. It would be shut out immediately. And yet we see it sanctioned constantly. 

Being inclusive of Jews would require both a change in rhetoric and having zero tolerance for rhetoric that is outside of those bounds. But SJP refuses to adjust their rhetoric (and token orgs like JVP endorse what they say). 

Imagine how powerful it would be if campus protestors held a vigil honoring the victims of 10/7  and in memory of the 12,000 children in Gaza murdered by the Israeli government, called for the release of the hostages, and an immediate ceasefire. Imagine if the protestors said ‚Äúwe understand the fear of our fellow Jewish Bruins right now and we stand in solidarity with them‚Äù ‚Äî even the ‚ÄúZionists‚Äù ‚Äî and erased the genocidal graffiti that calls for destroying Tel Aviv and escorted them through campus and ate kosher food at Hillel in solidarity and asked them what they could do to make them feel safer.  

Jewish people feel abandoned right now. They feel alone and betrayed. The acceptable ways of being openly Jewish in left-wing spaces are becoming smaller and smaller. But I don‚Äôt see these protestors building bridges; I see them picking a side in a game. For Jews and Palestinians, this is not a fucking football game. It is our lives, and the only way forward is to uplift the dignity and safety of both communities.",75,1714156382.0,t3_1cdppxs

I see this two ways:

1. protestors dont know what they are chanting means (bad look as they should have done research on a subject before protesting).
2. protestors do know what it means, and are encouraging the uninformed to join them (even worse look).

While the protest may have a good meaning behind it, it is currently being used and abused by 100% antisemites while seemly 0 protestors are removing these people from the group and even protecting them.

‚Äúglobalize the intifada‚Äù is 100% a call for violence against Jews. ""from the river to the sea"" 100% calls for the destruction of Israel. While protestors might not ""mean"" it that way, that is what they are calling for. The ""bad apples"" and the jewish people know it.

Like, someone who takes the position that Hamas started it so they're 100% responsible would say they're 100% responsible, right? So why 95%?

Maybe this comes down to interpretations of war law.  
[Here's the International Committee of the Red Cross's page about hospitals in armed conflicts, for a summary of how they're supposed to be used and protected, and what conduct can cause them to lose that protection](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/protection-hospitals-during-armed-conflicts-what-law-says%E2%80%8B).

""Notwithstanding the lack of an agreed definition, the rationale for a loss of protection is clear. Medical establishments and units enjoy protection because of their function of providing care for the wounded and sick. When they are used to interfere directly or indirectly in military operations, and thereby cause harm to the enemy, the rationale for their specific protection is removed. This would be the case for example if a hospital is used as a base from which to launch an attack; as an observation post to transmit information of military value; as a weapons depot; as a center for liaison with fighting troops; or as a shelter for able-bodied combatants.""

So, to get that 95% number, the argument could be that Hamas, by intentionally violating IHL and the laws of war WRT co-location of military targets among civilians, using hospitals for an ""act harmful to the enemy"", etc., then the responsibility for the deaths shifts to those who are wrongfully using civilians/hospitals as shields.",4,1714160500.0,t1_l1dhygd

1cdppxs,l1ezjpp,moosh233,"Israeli Jewish UCLA student here. I believe in free speech and freedom of expression. What I do NOT believe in is the use of antisemitism to convey pro Palestinian sentiments. Some examples of this (including the ones you mention):

1. ""From the river to the sea"" - Suggesting the complete eradication of Israel and thus the millions of Jewish Israelis that live there...aka an ethnic cleansing of the Jewish people. Also note that a majority of the Jews that do live in Israel are Mizrahi Jews (Jews from arab nations). There are ZERO Jews in Muslim countries in the Middle East (besides for literally like 1 Jew in Afganistan) because we were all expelled. My family for example comes from Syria but my great-grandmother had to escape due to religious persecution. Therefore, I hope you can see how chanting this phrase makes the Jewish community feel very unsafe and threatened.

2. Anything relating to the Intifada - The intifadas refer to violent Palestinian terrorism against the Jewish people in Israel. So when you're chanting anything like ""globalize the intifada"" you're essentially saying you'd like global terrorism against Jews.

3. The red hand pin (seen at the Oscars) - Refers to the Ramallah lynching of 2000 when 2 Israelis accidentally ended up in Palestinian territory and arrested for doing so. When people found out that they were located in a Palestinian police station, Palestinians broke in and murdered/dismembered their bodies. One individual was photographed holding up his hands - which were red from getting soaked with the blood of these individuals. So imagine my surprise when I see that, at the Oscars, Billie Eilish is wearing a red hand pin in solidarity with Gaza...she probably had no idea that what she was wearing was a symbol representing the lynching of Israeli/Jewish people.

4. Telling Jews to go back to Poland -  Just... -__-
-Jews are ethnically native to Judaea (modern day Israel)...no we are not all from Poland...we are not even all white. That's just the Ashkenazi (European) Jews. My grandfather (Syrian Jew) has very dark skin. My mother is dark olive skinned. I am olive skinned. 

On our campus:
4. the pig statue at UCLA - Jews have been historically depicted as ""greedy pigs"" since the middle ages, it's an antisemitic trope. I can go into more detail if needed
5. Devil horns on Gene Block - Gene Block, our Jewish chancellor, was depicted at the encampments with enlarged red eyes and devil horns. Jews were depicted as devils by the Nazis. I don't really feel like I need to further explain how this is an antisemitic trope.
6. Comparing Jews to Nazis - Do I really need to explain?

I can go into more detail and provide more examples if needed but my basic point here is that if people would like to continue claiming that antisemitism ‚â† antizionism, then STOP USING ANTISEMITIC TROPES IN YOUR STANCE AGAINST ISRAEL! It's just completely derailing and delegitimizing ANY AND ALL of your arguments. It just looks like complete and utter hatred against Jews.

While by no means all (and there have been very legitimate instances of antisemitism), for virtually all protestors, this is a fight for the enfranchisement and liberation of of an occupied and oppressed population more broadly, and a more immediate and urgent call for the cessation of a military campaign that is killing countless innocent civilians. There isn't any intended malice towards Jews, which is why they dismiss such accusations out of hand.

The only possibly ethical way to do so, is to facilitate the creation of a viable independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This would be a painful process but a necessary one for the long-term survival of the Jewish state.

Barring that, if the current policies of the Israeli government, particularly the settler movement, render a two-state solution impossible, and only a singular political entity can exist in the region, then the continued persistent occupation and repression of millions of people, simply to prop up a Jewish ethnostate is immoral and unjustifiable and ultimately unsustainable.

1.

2.

3.

Bro, Hamas is horrific and they could be yesterday‚Äôs news if Palestinians simply wanted it. They could expel, punish, arrest or simply turn in the locations of these people and the hostages, but they don‚Äôt because Palestinians are Hamas. The popularity/approval rate of Hamas in Palestine would make any US politician or President envious.  Pretty much half of them (and almost 80% in the West Bank), support what Hamas did on Oct 7th.

Protest slogans always make the people in positions of privillege uncomfortable. We could be saying ""stop the killing"" (and we do say that) and that would be called pro-Hamas.

Don't engage with counter protestors honestly. They claim to want the hostages freed but won't protest Netanyahu - the guy who decided to bomb all of Gaza where the hostages are and likely killed most of them.

Intifada is the Arabic word for revolution. It literally means the shaking off (of oppression). Has nothing to do with Jews, there's been intifadas throughout the mdidle east. You could describe womens rights movements as intifadas, and American revolution (wow!) as an intifada.

1dfh5cx,l8ldalz,[deleted],"Yes, it is a recurring problem, but it's not recent at all. Look at the history of 1960s activism.

There's often a dogmatic faction within social movements that insists anyone who disagrees with them is a ""traitor"" or a ""liberal"" or ""moderate"", and gains clout by posing as extreme. They may believe in proselytizing to the unconverted, but they categorically refuse to work with anyone who does not share their principles and isn't willing to confirm. Then you sometimes also get a status competition for who can be most extreme, with multiple dogmatic factions forming, which can fracture the movement. All sorts of social psychological processes kick in - groupthink, manichean thinking, ritual purity, ends justify the means, etc. Then at the end of the process you have factions that hate each other more than their common enemy. To quote Monty Python's the Life of Brian, ""The only people we hate worse than the Romans is the People's Front of Judea!"" - The Judean People's Front.

1dfh5cx,l8lg4ay,vvarden,"One of the reasons the constant comparisons by protestors of themselves to the Civil Rights Movement have been so silly though was the latter took great pains to avoid that outcome. Having figureheads who were representatives of the movement instead of an anonymous collective operating a social media page helps. 

Also, the goals and tactics simply made more sense to the uninitiated. The Montgomery Bus Boycotts were directly protesting a local policy and the people arrested for civil disobedience were the same victims of the unjust policies.

That‚Äôs not the case at UCLA, where the connections are incredibly tenuous (and they had to make the antisemitic demand of divesting from the Nazarian Center to make it somewhat relevant).",15,1718379991.0,t1_l8ldalz
1dfh5cx,l8lm0ox,[deleted],"Oh sorry, I was not clear. I was not making an analogy to the civil rights struggle of the 1950s-1960s, but rather to the antiwar movement of the 1960s-1970s. The lessons of that period weigh heavily on me.

If we want to do a comparison to the civil rights movement, though, then you're right that the civil rights activists had better message discipline and they didn't do disruption for the sake of disruption. 

(I personally think going after the Nazarian Center was both tactically bad, anti-academic freedom and yes it raised my own suspicions that there was something off here, which I should have listened to more at the outset).",9,1718381984.0,t1_l8lg4ay

But these Gaza protests have perfectly illustrated why the country was against the protestors, to me. Taking a sympathetic cause and poisoning it with bigotry and terrorism is how that happens.

I think back at the soldiers who returned from Vietnam and were protested, shouted at, flags burned in front of them. They went to fight in this war unwillingly, had to face some of the biggest horrors of humanity, were chewed up and spit out by their government, and there was just zero empathy extended to them by the people ostensibly against the war.

The biggest reaction is indifference, today. People are ignoring the war in Gaza as much as they are ignoring the campus unrest.     

And the reports of Vietnam veterans being spit upon are greatly exaggerated.  Yes they came back to a huge cultural shift usually, and an indifferent public but much of that feeling of their being abandoned had to do with HOW they came back, not in their Army units and such but alone as individuals into a veterans' support culture that was either non-existent, or openly hostile to them from a generational POV.  

I reject the suggestion that those who oppose the war in Gaza have ""poisoned their movement"" at all.  You've simply seen the most extreme elements pushed forward in the mass media.  People all over the globe are against this war and Netanjahu is now an indicted war criminal.  The entire United Nations condemns Israel's actions and lack of a plan for Gaza once they finish bombing all it into rubble.  

If there's ""bigotry"" in the movement it's because Jewish people demand that their race and religion cannot be separated from their politics and national identity.

The idea that police should be brutal to all the protestors because of the actions of a few violent ones is *collective blame and punishment.* Frankly, we don't even have a sense of what % of the protestors are on board with this ""any means necessary"" crap, but I doubt it's a lot of them. They are American college students, not Nicaraguan revolutionaries (no offense to the Sandinistas). 

Victim-blaming and collective blame (e.g., ""blood libel"") are bad. I really hate having to point these things out again and again. 

Also, the worst violence that occurred on campus in the last two months (besides the actions of police) was the violent mob of ""counter-protestors"" that attacked the encampment.

On 4/30 they and all the students in the encampment, withstood four hours of unrelenting physical assaults by Pro-Israel thugs and neo-Nazis while over a hundred police stood by doing nothing.  Then, it was all papered over and even though at least a dozen of these vigilante thugs seem to have been easy and swiftly identified, only one has been arrested.  

The chancellors and police chief haven't held a single press conference and they won't answer any questions about the catastrophic failure to keep the peace on 4/30.  When people in authority who could have simply negotiated with you instead leave you to DIE at the hand of literal Nazis, it tends to be difficult to forgive and forget. 

Again, I am not SPJ nor am I advocating for any violence ever but were they to burn the Chancellor's residence to the ground I'd say UCLA pretty much had it coming.  It's a miracle that 25 people went to hospital on 4/30 and not to the morgue, but if they had, UCLA demonstrated fully that the police were unwilling to stop the NAZI assaults, and only interested in protecting themselves and the counter-protesters, none of whom were arrested.

1dfh5cx,l8lkvwu,[deleted],"Yeah, I do think there is a rising problem of antisemitism in American society. I don't think this post or the post Monday are manifestly ""antisemitic"", although that might very well be what's lurking underneath the surface. What they do seem to explicitly indicate is

1. support for violent means, which is greatly at odds with my observations of the movement's emphasis on civil disobedience and de-escalation (at least prior to this week at UCLA)
2. An adherence to an Islamist ideology (by saying the movement for Palestinian liberation has an ""Islamic foundation"", disregarding the Christian Palestinians entirely and disregarding the whole 'this is a multi-religious movement' thing SJP has said previously)
3. Clearly eliminationist rhetoric - putting Israeli in scare quotes as if the country does not exist, suggesting that there are no good Israelis, comparing Israelis to slaveowners, and saying brute force is the only way Palestinian liberation will be achieved.

Frankly it sounds like Hamas has taken over the SJPatUCLA instagram account. If the students don't support this bullshit then they need to do damage control ASAP. For their own sake and for all of our sakes I really hope they denounce this and make amends right away.

P.S. We still disagree about the encampment checkpoints. I don't think they were antisemitic or anti-Zionist because - and share evidence if I'm missing something - the checkpoints were applied to everyone.

That's ""space laser"" level anti-semitic nonsense, and yes DLAM confirmed they were bought from a pet store, probably feeder mice for snakes.   And yet pro encampment undergraduates reported this narrative as fact in faculty meetings, the story made it into the Islamophobia task-force polemic (which is shamefully bad), and the mice became rats for Ilham Omar when berating Block.

Yes, that I kinda agree with; regardless of whether or not the firebombing actually happened, SJPatUCLA's Instagram is seemingly endorsing it. That to me is a huge problem.

No, I have not been following events at CSULA. I've been slightly preoccupied with Gaza and with the crisis here at UCLA (sarcastic understatement).

You wrote, ""They need to disavow all violence and shake up their leadership. We‚Äôve both agreed what‚Äôs happening in Palestine is a humanitarian disaster."" Yes, precisely. There's no way a violent left movement will achieve anything in the US in 2024, especially because (last time I checked) the right is so much better-armed than the left.

What happened is possible bad actors took over their encampment on Wednesday and they marched over to their Student Services Building where their admissions, records, accessible technology, EOP office, and a bunch of other stuff. Now, CSULA is a commuter school and serves the underserved community and many students there will now not get support for their upcoming semester until things get fixed and sorted. They essentially held people hostage in that building for hours. One of the people trapped in that building is their chancellor. The encampment there told the people stuck that ‚Äúthey will escort them out and won‚Äôt harm them‚Äù but when they started vandalizing floors 1-4 and creating a barricade, how can you trust that?

And how easily they fall prey to spokespersons who won't answer questions.  Public trust and institutional credibility should be earned, not given.  And IMO all trust and credibility for the entire UC system's administrators has been lost since the mob attacks of 4/30 where pro-Israel thugs alongside known Neo-nazis were allowed to assault students with more than a hundred police from multiple agencies standing on the sidelines doing nothing.  One arrest, no answers. It's corrupt. 

Like the Berkley administrators, the UCLA admins and chancellors won't respond to reporters' questions because they truly have no answers.  And they are using their power in corrupt ways to let various ""narratives"" drive public opinion rather than provide transparency and accountability.

1dfh5cx,l8ojt0g,Jean_dodge67,"""Pics or it didn't happen.""  Fireworks are not ""arson.""  And claims are not proof.  There's nothing here that proves anything at all happened but the social media messages and an ""investigation"" that's not announced by the cops or the fire department, who won't answer questions from the media.    

That doesn't mean I think this is a wise tactic or that nothing happened.  It means, don't jump to conclusions.  Have we not learned anything from seeing how little it took to bring a vigilante mob, including Neo-Nazis onto campus ready to commit violent assaults for four hours on students?  

This same single post could say, ""we've robbed Fort Knox of all of its gold and are going to levitate the Pentagon next.""  It's bullshit, essentially.  As far as I can tell, the fire department didn't even respond, and the cops didn't know about it except from the social media post that was reported at noon the next day.  That's some arson attack.  These are unproven claims.  Even if there were some scorched bushes and a smoke smudge on the side of the building, someone would have posted it by now, wouldn't you think?  

Did you ever hear the story of Chicken Little, or the little boy who cried ""Wolf?"" Or see the viral video of the cop who had an acorn fall off the roof of his car?  

edit: I hate to admit that I also jump to conclusions but I wrote this above part before googling all the latest ""news"" about this and sure enough, none of them say ANYTHING that could be called definitive about any fire anywhere on the UC Berkeley campus.  But it was such obvious ""vaporware"" that I could tell from what the University spokesperson was saying that they haven't got any proof, not one clue. They haven't even said the fire department is investigating, either.  THEY WON'T ANSWER QUESTIONS from reporters because they have no answers, just like Gene Block won't answer questions either about the failures of 4/30.  

NOTHING, or at least nothing obvious or discernible to anyone with a cell phone camera happened here except a lot of people like to hear themselves talk on subjects they know nothing about.   If you truly want to burn a building down, it's not hard to do.   If you want to start rumors on the internet that are just as inflammatory, or worse, you don't even need a match.

Also, childish downvotes are not proof, or cogent arguments.  The only thing they ""prove"" is that someone has nothing good to say to refute what I've said here.",-4,1718423351.0,t3_1dfh5cx

Also, I totally get that I wrote a shit-ton, so I don't blame you if you don't want to read and continue. It‚Äôs split up in 3 comments

Firstly, regarding point 1 about bombings, just to preface with things we agree on:

&gt;that is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for violating the Geneva Conventions. Two wrongs don't make a right.

Absolutely, no doubt. I would be pretty appalled if anyone tried to claim that Israel hasn‚Äôt committed war crimes (violating specifically the Geneva Convention about civilians).

&gt;The scale of destruction IS unusual:... This mixed-media report from NBC News shows how Israel destroyed ALL of Gaza's universities: ...

Agreed again, and this definitely goes hand-in-hand with some dangerous rhetoric by politicians (one of many examples is ‚Äú\[w\]e need to deal a blow that hasn‚Äôt been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza,‚Äù and they seem to have decently followed up on this specific kind of rhetoric.¬†

&gt;This Amnesty International report details several incidents that appear to be illegal attacks on civilian targets: ...

I can agree about tragic deaths of civilians of the conflict. But, at least in this case, I don‚Äôt agree that Israel bombed a ‚Äúsafe zone‚Äù (because to my knowledge, Rafah was not a mutually agreed upon safe zone in the war), and I don‚Äôt agree that this is a reflection of Israel forces targeting civilians (I‚Äôll talk about this later.)

&gt;The pace of killing of journalists and media workers in Gaza appears to be unprecedented, and it strains credulity to think that all these deaths were just accidents:[ https://niemanreports.org/articles/with-dozens-dead-and-more-wounded-journalists-in-gaza-have-faced-deadliest-six-months-ever-recorded/](https://niemanreports.org/articles/with-dozens-dead-and-more-wounded-journalists-in-gaza-have-faced-deadliest-six-months-ever-recorded/)

Yeah, this is super gross and should absolutely not be acceptable.

&gt;This article from 972, an Israeli publication, offers evidence of indiscriminate bombings and is one of the scariest things I've EVER read. 972 alleges - with testimony from soldiers - that Israel has used AI to expedite and automate mass murder:[ https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/)

Obviously, I agree with the facts regarding Israel using AI tech to expedite murder. However, I disagree with the fact that this reflects indiscriminate bombings (or genocide). As that article explains, that system still only (is meant to) target ‚Äúoperatives of Hamas‚Äô military wing.‚Äù Obviously, as the article also explains, this results in a decent number of ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù in the form of civilian lives, and also the system can mistakenly identify civilians as targets. But the fact is that Israel does distinguish between civilians and combatants, and that they don‚Äôt have intent of targeting civilians.

It has been seen that typically in urban combat (which is what the Israel-Hamas war is classified as), the civilian-combatant casualty proportion is around[ 9:1](https://civiliansinconflict.org/our-work/conflict-trends/urban-warfare/) . In the present conflict, this proportion is likely somewhere between[ 2:1](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-officials-15000-likely-killed-in-gaza-since-start-of-war-5000-of-them-are-hamas/) (IDF‚Äôs report) and[ 4:1](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-six-week-drive-hit-hamas-rafah-scale-back-war-2024-02-19/) (Hamas‚Äô officials report. Hamas did officially deny this, but they didn‚Äôt provide their own count). Instead of getting into the weeds about efforts taken by Israel to avoid civilian casualties, I will pose these statistics to you as evidence for Israel doing so.",2,1716155757.0,t1_l4ne8nv
1cuk4q7,l4skc9c,araja_abbado,"&gt;2. The statements of high-level officials are a key piece of evidence, because the definition of genocide includes genocidal INTENT.¬†

I agree (and the ICJ agrees). These statements were brought forth to the ICJ by South Africa, and it resulted in the ICJ giving a warning that Israel needs to take measures to avoid a potential genocide. But in the same way that the US‚Äô actions against Japan are more relevant than the statements of generals, I again think that we ought to examine the actual actions taken to see if Israel has followed up on crazy statements (like Herzog saying all of Gaza is culpable, and some other official likening Israel‚Äôs response to the Nakba, which are insane things)

&gt;Statements from Netanyahu, Herzog, Gallant, etc. show that the Israeli state blames all Gazans for the actions of Hamas, believes that collective punishment is justified, and want to make Gaza a place that is inhospitable to human life.

I agree with the part about collective punishment (which is illegal under Geneva) and some wanting to be super aggressive against Gaza, but I don‚Äôt think that most of their statements indicate that they blame all of Gaza. (The exceptions are Herzog‚Äôs statement about the entirety of Gaza, and the other official‚Äôs statement about the Nakba). Even Netanyahu‚Äôs really problematic rhetoric about ‚Äúchildren of light vs evil‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem to be referring to all of Gaza. I think most of the statements are either clear about blaming Hamas or ambiguous.",2,1716155766.0,t1_l4skbf5

1cuk4q7,l4jyjop,[deleted],"There's the usual extreme perspectives that people have. And the Israeli-Palestinian debacle is a particularly heated topic for both sides, so already otherwise reasonable folks seem less willing to appreciate nuance.

But on top of that, more sinisterly, there is this whole added layer of people who are payed to promote pro-Isreali propaganda. One of the PR methods is paid shills on reddit. These accounts often created in past 6 months and they are NOT UCLA affiliated - though they often pretend to be. They often write inflammatory posts, usually accusing anything pro-Palestinian as being anti-Semitic or as pro-Hamas. This is not unique to UCLA, but is happening on college reddits and other forums that get a lot of eyeballs. There's huge money going to this to influence regular media and social media.

1cuk4q7,l4o8562,External-Praline-451,"Hi Professor Speer,

I am not a student or alum, in fact I live across the pond and the protests have been in the news, which I know protestors wanted. I find it interesting to visit subs about news topics to read what people's experiences are, because the media always has biases.

You're obviously very knowledgeable about stuff that also concerns me, so I hope you don't mind me chiming in. I usually try not to comment on subs like this, just read what people say, but it seems like a good opportunity to interact with someone involved.

You mentioned trolls and brigading. Living in the UK, I am all too familiar with them influencing politics, namely Brexit and [Russia's involvement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Security_Committee_Russia_report#:~:text=The%20report%20describes%20the%20United,had%20affected%20the%20Brexit%20referendum.) in that! Bots and trolls are certainly not just an Israel issue.

It is admirable that students are protesting the situation in Gaza and feel so passionate about it, but I worry about what they are not paying enough attention to what's happening in the US.

Democracy in the US is seriously under threat with Project 2025, reproductive rights being stripped away, the attacks on LGBTQ folk. Trump is openly saying he'll be a dictator! The far-right is rising globally, and if Democracy falls in the US, I feel it will be like a stack of cards in western democracies.

I'd love to see the same passion in your students in standing up for their own freedom and future. Do you have plans to raise awareness of these issues and help your students fight for their own freedoms and future?",8,1716078644.0,t1_l4n9ksx

1cuk4q7,l4rxddo,Fresh_Plastic6006,"Correct. There is nuance, something officially missing from this conversation 90% of the time. This is how it often goes, at least on Reddit: 1) someone says something I disagree with, violates my sensibilities or makes me feel uncomfortable, 2) I immediately reference my catalogue of reasons to dismiss that person or their comment, 3) I pick one, e.g., ‚Äòpaid shills‚Äô, 4) I defend that position with circumstantial or anecdotal evidence, 5) I smugly sit back confident I have proven my point. 

The problem is that you can find a piece of circumstantial or anecdotal evidence to support nearly anything and this is only getting easier with the explosion of social media. Sure, I‚Äôm willing to believe that Israel has paid some people to advocate for them online, yes there are bots, agent provocateurs and false flag operations. All these things have happened and will continue to happen at some non-zero rate. Usually they exist on both sides of any issue. 

 When it becomes a reason to dismiss anything and everything one doesn‚Äôt agree with, it is effectively a force driving black and white thinking. In my mind, this is the single largest problem our society currently faces. Black and white thinking is also something that the internet and youth culture are especially susceptible to. As faculty, I would hope you consider it your job to challenge black and white thinking when you encounter it, encourage debate and constructive consideration of alternative viewpoints, etc. rather than feed into them and  rile them further. 

Being more quantitative could help here (and ought to be up your alley). Is there data on what percentage of individuals are actually paid a stipend to engage in protest/anti-protest activities? Or paid wages to hold a specific opinion which they champion on Reddit? My very strong suspicion is that number is quite low and that if I were Israel or Hamas or Jerry Seinfeld‚Äôs wife or whatever that my money would be much better spent advancing my politics in other ways than paying individuals.",1,1716146894.0,t1_l4n9oe9

It's not a false characterization at all to say that the pro-Palestinian protesters violently resisted on 5/2. It wasn't just the firing of extinguishers in cops' faces. They were pushing into the cops with plywood boards, shields fashioned from trash cans and umbrellas, the latter two of which were there expressly for that purpose, correct?

Also, the campers would surround, block and push into people who tried to photograph inside the encampment. Blocking a person's path in a public place is illegal. Stopping them from photraphing in same is a violation of their rights. Pushing into them in that manner is assault and battery.

I never justified the actions of the counter protesters who instigated violence on 5/1. But the pro-Palestinian crowd is forever using their violent acts to excuse and paper over their own illegal and violent acts.

There is also a Center for *Jewish* studies called the [Alan D. Leve Center](https://levecenter.ucla.edu/) that is separate from the Nazarian Center for *Israel* studies. From the perspective of a Chinese person, it sounds like the equivalent of a Nazarian Center would be like if UCLA had a *CCP* Studies instead of a *Chinese* studies center. And we kinda did have one covertly pop up, but backlash successfully made that go away, btw: [http://www.confucius.ucla.edu/](http://www.confucius.ucla.edu/) is a dead site.

If you support Israel and a person of the Jewish diaspora, I wouldn't recommend comparing it to what China is for the Chinese diaspora btw. Most people of the Chinese diaspora DO NOT LIKE the Chinese gov, unless your family just moved from mainland China in the last 2 generations or so. Even then, people are scared of getting disappeared by the CCP lol

Also, 90% of the academic work that American universities do on China (the country, as opposed to Chinese culture) is about how to counter its growing influence. Rightfully so, as a Chinese American poli sci grad. You making this comparison is like saying you want the Nazarian Center to study if we should stop letting US universities accept grad level stem students from Israel because we are scared of Israeli spies getting advanced tech (a real talk I once attended about Chinese grad students btw)

Everyone would be fine with it, except actual antisemites.

But in the current reality, that genocide is happening and has been happening at a growing scale for decades. Meanwhile, the Holocaust is long behind us. Not to say that we should readily forget the lessons of history, but persecution against Jews is not exactly on the top 10 list of global problems today, in 2024.

So there is a troublesome situation now, where the government that has historically marketed itself as a protector of a marginalized group is now committing war crimes against another group. And to complicate things further, a militant terrorist organization has gained power within the walls of the occupied area. So yeah, there are going to be a variety of perspectives and it's very hard to label anybody as the clear cut ""good guy"" in this conflict. Yet innocent civilians die in the thousands as casualties of war.


The most important thing to consider in all of this is the historical context. The ACTUAL history, not the propaganda. Many people take issue with the idea that the Israel/Palestine region ""belongs"" to Jews because of some ""ancestral birthright"" granted by a religious text of a religion that not everyone believes in. This has clear callbacks to several ugly parts of history, such as the ""manifest destiny"" that was used to justify the displacement and genocide of Native Americans, or the Crusades, for example. Further, it is a narrative that was constructed in the 20th century by the British, not a widely held belief of Jews prior to then. Religious ""birthrights"" as justification for violence against a group of people usually ends up on the ""wrong side of history"" by today's standards. 

And any way you look at it, the formation of a Jewish state in a land that is already occupied by another people is going to inherently lead to some conflicts. Because of this, some people perceive the entire implementation of the state of Israel in the 20th century to be illegitimate and an example of imperialism. This has nothing to do with antisemitism.

Another annoying aspect to this is the widespread idea that ""the middle east and its various religions have been at war for millenia"" in order to justify war. This is provably false, and it is known that Jews, Muslims, and Christians all lived relatively peacefully in Palestine prior to the formation of the state of Israel.

It is important to understand the formation of the state of Israel as a result of the 1917 Balfour Declaration. 1917 is the year when the British Empire decided that it had the right to carve up the middle east as a strategic move in order to maintain power and also convince British Jews to leave the island to satisfy their domestic antisemites.",44,1714850918.0,t3_1ck66g9

I'll take that as face value since I am just an American Jew.

OP defines:

&gt; Zionism just means ‚ÄúThe right for there to be a Jewish state‚Äù

And that's the definition I've long believed in.

If you don't mind let's call that Definition A.

What definition of Zionism do you have? Let's call that B.

So if Jews in Israel are not Zionist, presumably by def'n B, what are they?  Do they believe in definition A?

If they believe in neither A nor B, why are they staying in Israel?

1ck66g9,l2lxha4,kayanube,"Indeed, the underlying point you're making about the generalized targeting of entire ethnic or national groups in protests is a critical one. Such generalizations can indeed lead to illogical and unfair conclusions about individuals based solely on their ancestry or ethnic background, which is inherently problematic.

When protests focus on condemning a whole country or ethnicity, it inherently imposes a stereotype on all individuals from that background, expecting them to behave or respond in a certain way due to their ancestry. This is not only an oversimplification but also can veer dangerously into discriminatory territory. For instance, expecting all Palestinians‚Äîor individuals of any other specific nationality or ethnic group‚Äîto hold the same beliefs or behave uniformly due to their national or ethnic identity does not account for the vast diversity of thoughts, feelings, and actions within any group. This approach undermines individual agency and obscures the complex mosaic of human identity.

Such expectations can indeed be seen as a form of racial or ethnic prejudice because they reduce complex individuals to mere representatives of their group identities. This is what makes certain protests based on these generalized notions so illogical. It is essential to target specific policies, behaviors, or actions that are objectionable, rather than attributing blame to a whole group. This approach not only fosters a more accurate understanding but also upholds the principles of justice and individual responsibility.",4,1714861445.0,t3_1ck66g9
1ck66g9,l2lcy1d,[deleted],"You do know that you are trying to deflect blame on China and a lot of us can see right through it. And according to the Zionist, if you criticize Israel, you are Antisemitic. Using the same logic, if you criticize China, you must be Sinophobic. If we must ask ourselves how the Zionist Jews feel, then we must also ask ourselves how Chinese mainland students at UCLA must feel about the constant anti-China rhetoric from the media and from fellow classmates like yourself. See I can play this game as well.

Also, equating Judaism to Zionism is antisemitic since not all Jews believe in Zionism. There are Jewish students who also participated in the encampments and are against what is happening in Gaza. How does it feel for them that they get labelled as anti-semitic? Why aren't we asking about their feelings as well but pander towards people who believe that the state of Israel should exist (which sounds a lot like nationalism to me) even though Palestinians have been living in that area for centuries. Why is it that people who believe that a Palestinian state should exist gets labelled as Hamas terrorists and how come we don't ask about their feelings especially since outside agitators literally threw fireworks at them the other night.

See thats the great thing about the US. You can dunk on people for their political views. Be it Democrats and Republicans love to shit on one another.

I think accepting any offer entailed a finality that they weren't really willing or ready to accept - i.e. giving up completely or mostly on ""the right of return"" etc.  And I think a lot of people in their leadership were insecure about maintaining their positions of power if a peace deal were ever signed - like they derived their power from the struggle for a state and would lose it if the state ever came to fruition.

Edit:  Also its hard to fathom why people are surprised by what's happening right now.  What's happening right now is very much in the realm of possibility when peace doesn't exist between two groups.  Refusing to make peace opens the door to the current situation.  People act as if there's just supposed to be some de facto peace or informal truce between the two sides in the absence of a formally agreed to peace.

1ck66g9,l2maevc,Ramen-Naruto,"When we're mention Zionism at least in the context of the Israeli-Palestine conflict, we're mainly referring to Israeli nationalism, which is totally different from the wish for the existence of a Jewish state.

Nationalism as a political movement strives to expand a nation's own interests, especially to the exclusion or detriment to others. Note that this nationalism starkly differs from the historical nationalism in which peoples advocated for self-autonomy from larger powers. I won't advocate the comparison, but think about German nationalism as an example of what some people consider what Israeli nationalism equates to.

Also, nobody is taking attention off of China or Russia for their criminal deeds, and American foreign policy has reflected that. The reason why so much attention is on the war in Gaza is because America actively supports these actions.

Also, to flip the claim, why is it that when Western countries starkly criticize or impose sanctions on China or Russia for their crimes, the media and Congress don't invoke the question of anti-Chinese or anti-Russian racism, but when pro-Palestine supporters make similar criticism of the Israeli state, it is then considered antisemitic?

I can't deny that among the pro-Palestine crowd there are antisemitic bigots, but similarly there are likely Islamophobes among the pro-Israel crowd as well. One shouldn't take the most radical cases of bigotry and extend them to the full movement.",-1,1714866903.0,t3_1ck66g9

The United States made Iran its enemy when the CIA overthrew a democratically elected leader because the western oil conglomerates were worried they wouldn't be able to continue exploiting Iran's resources since he was a socialist. And then the CIA pushed and funded every right wing radical they could find and put them in positions of power. 

The USSR asked to join NATO after WW2. The United States declined. Why? Because socialism and communism is scary because god forbid there's a threat to US capital. Never mind the fact that Putin was basically ""our"" guy who was liberal (in a classical economics sense) and wanted to open up the markets. 

And China is the even better one because during their civil war, the ones that fled to Taiwan, were the fascists but the US took their side because they were anti-communist.

And the even funnier thing is, the United States is literally currently arming and supporting a fascist state in Israel who wants to maintain an apartheid ethnostate.

1ebjwwq,lf0jf2n,Lu-Tze,"I am going assume that you are genuinely curious and answer as such.  There are several things to consider so I would encourage you read up more about it on your own. (apologies for the wall of text but I am going to try and address your main concerns as directly as possible).

*Meritocracy*

The current situation where there are more Daves than women (the Dave rule) in positions of power in academia and industry is **NOT** because of meritocracy.  Moreover, there are several studies that show that merely changing a gender- or race-specific name in a resume has a significant impact on whether you get an interview ‚Äì suggesting that minorities are discriminated against.   DEI in hiring is trying to fix this current bias.

*Forcing Diversity*

DEI in hiring does not mean quotas ‚Äì I do not know of a single company or University that has quotas to decide the final hire.  DEI in hiring means *interviewing* a more diverse pool of candidates.  This might include reaching out to more diverse candidates and encouraging them to apply, it might even mean forcing hiring committees to at least interview a minimum number of ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù candidates.  For instance, look up the Rooney rule.

*Hiring the best for the role*

I have spent a couple of decades hiring people in academia and industry.  It is rare that there is a single person that everyone agrees is the only candidate who will succeed in the role.  It often comes down to 2-3 people.  There are studies by Google and other big organizations that have shown that it is very hard to predict the probability of success in the career at the end of the interview process.  Having DEI mindset, ensures you are not just defaulting to the ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù candidate that shares the background with the hiring committee - which may mean gender, race, cultural/academic background, etc. Again, look up the Rooney rule.  The average black coach hired right after the Rooney rule came into effect outperformed the white coaches and now black and white coaches are roughly at the same level.  There is no evidence that the quality of coaching was worsened. Furthermore, reaching into a pool that is under-represented in the hiring process might get you even better candidates.

*Other advantages*

Diversity also has other non-tangible advantages.  For instance, I was once in a graduate department where we had 12 faculty members and all of them were men.  Looking at our candidate pool, we could see that not many women were even applying to our program.  This was especially worrying because a majority of our students were women. As we sorted through the mess, we realized big things (like how much female students yearned for role models for how their careers would look like) but also mundane things (like we did not have a women‚Äôs toilet on our floor). Moreover, the three women who have been hired in that department in the last decade are just as good as any other researchers they have ever had.

Also, diversity can be as broad as you want. For instance, a recent conversation we had was how to attract veterans to certain roles in our company.  We are a biotech company so most of us are a bunch of PhDs.  The thought was whether BD, Finance type of roles would benefit from tapping from a different pool of candidates.

&gt; Respectfully, this is either disingenuous or uninformed. Given (1) the particularities of what makes someone a Jew and (2) the ways in which anti-Jewish hate is experienced in different ways by different kinds of Jews throughout the diaspora and in Israel ‚Äî when someone makes the choice to speak ‚Äúas a Jew,‚Äù questions about their Jewishness become fair game.

&gt;Standpoint epistemology tells us that Jews whose grandparents or great-grandparents came to the US a hundred years ago and have long ago assimilated into American whiteness cannot tell us anything insightful about the lived experience of say, an Iraqi Jew who fled anti-Jewish violence for Israel, had a parent or grandparent who fought in an Arab-Israeli war, and maybe lost a family member during the Second Intifada or on October 7th. A Jew speaking ‚Äúas a Jew‚Äù in order to speak over those voices ‚Äî as earnest and well-meaning as they may be ‚Äî forfeits the right to shut down questions about the lived experience of their Jewishness.

&gt;To be clear, there is nothing wrong with Jews who are for the first time interested in and exploring what it means to be Jewish (that‚Äôs great!). There is also nothing wrong with being a Jewish person who is against a morally indefensible war of revenge (I happen to be one myself). What is unacceptable is wielding one‚Äôs newly discovered Jewish identity as a cudgel, and only as a cudgel, against the Jewish state writ large and Jews with different experiences than one‚Äôs own (eg ‚ÄúZionists‚Äù).

&gt;Rediscovering one‚Äôs Judaism means approaching it with humility and curiosity, not with the self-certainty learned over a weekend of TikTok explainer videos ‚Äî and doing so would result in rhetoric markedly different than the kind of propaganda put out by JVP.

To be clear, if I am engaging in conversation with a non-Jewish friend in good-faith about the issue, I will make clear that Israel does not speak for me, but I refuse to make that the *basis of my political identity* because Israel is not actually acting in my name, I am not an Israeli citizen, and my Judaism is more than just Israel, which is to say that I am genuinely interested in decoupling Israel and Judaism, to the extent possible (though I would say that‚Äôs remarkably difficult given Jewish people‚Äôs spiritual, historical, and familial ties to the place and that half the worlds Jews live there). 

How deeply and unconsciously internalized is one‚Äôs sense of Judenhass that they move through the world guilty until proven innocent? And how long before one starts actually believing in their own guilt? I refuse to move through the world wearing a sign that says ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù for the remainder of my days.

Given (1) the particularities of what makes someone a Jew and (2) the ways in which anti-Jewish hate is experienced in different ways by different kinds of Jews throughout the diaspora and in Israel ‚Äî when someone makes the choice to speak ‚Äúas a Jew,‚Äù questions about their Jewishness become fair game.

Standpoint epistemology tells us that Jews whose grandparents or great-grandparents came to the US a hundred years ago and have long ago assimilated into American whiteness cannot tell us anything insightful about the lived experience of say, an Iraqi Jew who fled anti-Jewish violence for Israel, had a parent or grandparent who fought in an Arab-Israeli war, and maybe lost a family member during the Second Intifada or on October 7th. A Jew speaking ‚Äúas a Jew‚Äù in order to speak over those voices ‚Äî as earnest and well-meaning as they may be ‚Äî forfeits the right to shut down questions about the lived experience of their Jewishness.

To be clear, there is nothing wrong with Jews who are for the first time interested in and exploring what it means to be Jewish (that‚Äôs great!). There is also nothing wrong with being a Jewish person who is against a morally indefensible war of revenge (I happen to be one myself). What is unacceptable is wielding one‚Äôs newly discovered Jewish identity as a cudgel, and only as a cudgel, against the Jewish state writ large and Jews with different experiences than one‚Äôs own (eg ‚ÄúZionists‚Äù).

Rediscovering one‚Äôs Judaism means approaching it with humility and curiosity, not with the self-certainty learned over a weekend of TikTok explainer videos ‚Äî and doing so would result in rhetoric markedly different than the kind of propaganda put out by JVP.

I'd love to see that doxing attempt.  

And I'll be the first to admit: Israel's treatment of Palestinians over the past ~80 years is on par with all but the worst examples of apartheid and genocide in modern history.  Pol Pot did manage to kill significantly more people...so far.  Not a high bar.  

As for what we can do to help Palestinians...it's difficult.  Many want to return to their homes.  They don't want to abandon their homeland.  Many are trying and fighting to stay, despite the ever-increasing checkpoints, walls, abuse...  

It's not anyone else's place to tell them they have to leave, and Israel's not going to stop encroaching, walling off land, bulldozing homes, and building illegal settlements.  

From an ethical standpoint, the support needs to stop.  The US government has been trying to leverage military aid to mitigate some of Israel's more extreme policies, but, to be frank, it hasn't been working and doesn't make sense.  At best, the US is *slowing* the genocide, while supporting it.  Israel has made it clear at this point that they're never going to stop.  I think the BDS movement has the right idea.  Cut Israel off from access to outside education, resources, and technology.  If it wants to be an apartheid nation, it can do so on its own, without our help.

Restrictions on Police

Police officers may not use their powers in a way that has a ‚Äúchilling effect‚Äù on ordinary people who wish to express their views. However, they can break up acts of civil disobedience or gatherings no longer observing reasonable time, place and manner restrictions.

You have the right to film the police:

‚Ä¢ In public spaces, you can photograph or film the police and police activity.
‚Ä¢ The police cannot demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, but they may be able to seize your phone while they get one. They should return it (or a copy of your data) within a few days. The police cannot delete your images.
‚Ä¢ The police may order you to cease activities that interfere with law enforcement. In private spaces, the owner can limit photos.
‚Ä¢ NOTE: The police can also photograph or videotape events that are open to the public, including protests. However, California‚Äôs right to privacy prohibits maintaining unnecessary information.
‚Ä¢ Even though you have a constitutional right to film, you can‚Äôt interfere in an investigation, and you might be hassled if you appear to be doing so.

Police Dispersal Orders

‚Ä¢ Shutting down a protest through a dispersal order must be law enforcement‚Äôs last resort. Police may not break up a gathering unless there is a clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic, or other immediate threat to public safety.
‚Ä¢ Individuals must receive clear and detailed notice of a dispersal order, including how much time they have to disperse, the consequences of failing to disperse, and what clear exit route they can follow, before they may be arrested or charged with any crime.
‚Ä¢ If you are subject to a dispersal order that you believe is unlawful, comply. But when you can, write down everything you remember, including the officers‚Äô badge and patrol car numbers and the agency they work for. Take photographs. Get contact information for witnesses. And please call the ACLU intake line at 415-621-2488.

I wonder what the rhetoric was when Carrie Lam and the HK government started shutting down and arresting protestors who were using much more violent means of protests. You guys think the people like _compiled who just love jerking it to ""rule of law"" were going ""yeah well if you break the law you 100% should be arrested"" or if they were going ""wow look at the government squashing dissent using police violence and mob violence against the protestors instead of listening to what the protestors have to say.""

Because a consistent application of their logic would have them 100% supporting the police and government arresting over 10,000 protestors. 

Or like to you bootlickers, is it okay if America does it but definitely not okay in other countries.

No one gave two shits about the protestors actions because they were protesting against the extradition clause that the CCP wanted to change. No one was pearl clutching about the way they were protesting nor were there people like you going ""wow look at that property damage - won't someone think about the poor workers."" 

The mainstream rhetoric was ""wow look at the CCP expanding its ""authoritarian"" reach over Hong Kong."" Which sidenote, for a country that passed the invade the hague act in 2002, we sure are doing a lot of virtue signaling about authoritarianism. 

When people were saying down with the CCP, people weren't going ""wow how dare they threaten the Chinese right of existence. Hmmm weird.

For me when I got a roommate that was horrible, I immediately went to the student housing with another friend who wanted out of their roommate situation too. They had a swap day and we took advantage of it. It improved the viewpoint and vibe by 180. 

If it‚Äôs a class or instructor, always have a backup plan beforehand. Usually over register for classes knowingly that you will drop one of the worst classes. 

But realize this negative feeling has to go. Even if you transfer out, this feeling might follow you to the next campus. If you need to talk to someone for your mental health, goto health services and get your head right. 

You need to take the initiative to make these changes for yourself. No one else will do that for you.

As a professor of sociology, I know how to spot a moral panic when I see one.

Protestors don't want to talk with ""counter-protestors"" or the media because they are afraid. They are afraid of being doxed, harassed, or even physically harmed by the rightwing ""counter-protestors.""",18,1716669714.0,t1_l5npnv9

1d0e85g,l5oh9ky,[deleted],"No, I don't need to check twice. We can have a civil conversation if you're interested.

Here is where I'm coming from. In the past couple of months I have watched a moral panic unfold. I am a sociologist and this is something I've learned about extensively, and I know what it generally looks like.[ Goode and Ben-Yehuda (1994)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2083363.pdf) outline the five following elements of moral panics:

1. a period of heightened concerned over a specific category of people and their behavior (e.g., college students, college professors, student protestors)

2. heightened hostility towards said group(s) of people (e.g., lawsuit alleging there are ""Hamas-leaning faculty"", Congresswoman Steel calling student protestors ""terrorists"")

3. a consensus amongst certain parts of society, or in society as a whole, that ""something must be done"" (see https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-10/how-social-media-rumors-sparked-a-night-of-mayhem-at-ucla)

4. the reaction is disproportionate to the actual threat (e.g., afaik there are no openly pro-Hamas faculty, UCLA students are definitely not terrorists, and the college students I've talked to are not anti-semitic)

5. the episode suddenly happens and then subsides (we will see on this one)

This was all quite frightening. What scares and hurts me the most was seeing UCLA students and employees attacked by a mob proclaiming to be defending Jews and/or Israel, inflicting violence on *my community,* *in my name.* It's also quite scary that some of this ""pro-Israel"" mob were known antisemites! Fear of antisemitism was weaponized by the far right to attack my community, in my name. 

Maybe after reading this you can understand why I'm pushing back more on the ""pro-Israel"" side on this subreddit. If a ""pro-Palestinian"" mob had attacked UCLA for four hours I would be furious. If people start posting things on this subreddit praising Hamas or calling for Israeli Jews to be murdered in their houses, then I would angrily type long replies to their posts.",10,1716681537.0,t1_l5nru2z
1d0e85g,l5o3nox,Jean_dodge67,"Do you have any insight or solutions to propose?  The person who sounds less than professional here is you.  Most of your critique seems to be about how social media is an imperfect realm, and that people use obvious ways to sway any given argument in their favor other than with a structured debating society's rules and guidelines. That's hardly breaking news.  

The topic, as I see it is the faulty's no confidence vote in UCLA chancellor Gene Block, who can and will and has ignored this vote.  It's non-binding and that to me is a worthy topic, one I view as, what is a university, what does it stand for, who is it and ""who is driving the bus here?"" 

If you were to possibly address some of this we might have a lively discussion. Because I really see you saying here is, ""gosh, you only advocate for your side!""  

What the pro-Palestine side is ""promoting"" is the basic concept of academic freedom, where free speech and free assembly are fundamentally integral to that.  The foundational purpose of a university is to promote and provide a place for academic freedom, and of course to confer degrees upon those who complete a course of study under that umbrella of having ideas challenged and such, peer review, academic scrutiny, etc etc.  At present we are not even sure from what you are saying that you are even interested in the purpose of a university at all.  I just see you carping and complain on the sidelines.  State your credentials and present your argument.

We eagerly await your thread, and a rigorous academic peer-reviewed abstract on the scope and margins of possible error. 

I think the topic here is, should Gene Block continue as Chancellor or is what happened in the last few weeks proof the man is out of his depth and making extremely bad decisions or not.  The wider questions are, what is a Chancellor and what besides being an overpaid apartment manager who looks over a collection of rooms that are not all slept in should a chancellor be doing with his time and energy?  

Because I can tell you what a university is - it's a place founded upon the principle of Academic Freedom where students researchers and professors come together to enact that concept pf free speech, free study, free assembly.  What it shouldn't be is a hedge fund with a funny mascot and a gift shop.  It's a place to see ideas set forth and challenged in an academic environment.   The rest is facilities management. That's Gene Block's job.  

If it is said or thought or advocated or argued on a university campus, a chancellor should basically have no input or opinion upon it.  Short of people trying to set one another ablaze WHICH HAPPENED ON 4/30, a chancellor shouldn't concern himself with it.

Excellent topic. Check out the book mentioned in the article above for some background on cops on campus, and all the serious issues this raises.   Then ask youself what level of concern students should have when an armed vigilante mob is allowed to assault students for four hours with chemical and incendiary weapons while beating them with improvised clubs and blunt objects in front of HUNDREDS of peace officers standing behind and beside the throngs of masked thugs?  If they won't intervene in a fist fight (and it was way worse than that) where was the line to be drawn?  If they wouldn't have stepped in if it was a knife fight, then it could have also soon been a sanctioned attack by arrows, or a sword and bayonet and lance attack, or a mass shooting. They actively demonstrated that it was open season on UCLA students.  FOR FOUR HOURS.  The coward cops egged the mob on, all night long.  Had, heaven forbid someone been bludgeoned to death their body would have laid there on the  grass until sunrise.  

At least, at Kent State they let the ambulance carry away the four dead.  Not so the case at UCLA on the next night with the riot squad replacing the mob.  
 
As to the FBI investigation, that is what we call a big fat fib when I was a child. When the Department of Justice sanctions an investigation, they issue a press release and hold a press conference where we meet the pertinent players and are given the scope and tenure of the matter.  When cops want to distract from the idea that they alone will be left to investigate their latest and most egregious failures, they drop the name of the FBI, who, by the way will take your phone call, too.  Or that of your landlady.  It means less than noting to float that idea because the main point is to push a lie, to create a false narrative.  There is and will be no federal investigation here.  If you doubt me, spend an hour looking for the press release announcing it, as I have.  You won't find it.  

LAPD is NOT the lead investigating body on the 4/30 mob attacks on students, either. The only investigation supposedly underway there is led by UCLA PD, whose chief is on suspension and whose vice-chancellor has been sent to virtual Siberia. and supplanted by a highly paid consultant known as a scandal management expert ""fixer"" who answers solely and only to Gene Block.   Get your facts straight. 

Don't let someone pee on your head and tell you it's raining.  

A ""policy review"" by 21st Century Policing Solutions was commissioned, it will likely take at least a year and has zero subpoena power.  Anyone who talks to them or gives them a single public records does so voluntarily with zero incentive for cooperation.  What it does and has accomplished is to provide an immediate excuse to stonewall and sequester all public records and recordings in an Open Records Act state.  ""We cannot comment on an ongoing investigation"" is such a sad cliche that they aren't even bothering to say it anymore.  They simply hold no press conferences and answer no records requests or respond to any reporters inquiries.  Nor will they present themselves in public where they might be asked questions in a public forum.  

Yes there is one detective on loan from LAPD supposedly helping look for these vigilante thugs.  But from the last 24 hours of statements from UCLA PD and consultant Rick Brazil we see that they are only investigating REPORTED assaults, not looking at the many live streams and online articles that clearly identify dangerous outside attackers and developing cases from that.  They are instead seemingly only going after people whom the victims of attacks are willing to come forward with witnesses and insisting on prosecution and pursuit of the cases.   Many of course are terrified of such actions, for fear of further armed assaults.  Plenty of the violence is clear but the victims may not be - none of those cases will go forward.   It's disingenuous to the point of being corrupt.  

Vital public trust and institutional credibility was lost on 4/30 and the ONLY path to a return of trust to administration and the police is through a process of RUTHLESS transparency and public oversight and accountability when in truth the admisntrataiton puts on a brave face but is running in the opposite directions. Each conviction of a mob member shines a light on a Uvalde sized failure of cops to protect students.  In west texas, two years ago yesterday hundreds of cops stood on the sidelines while a score of children when to the morgue.  On 4/30 in Westwood, hundreds of cops stood on the sidelines while a score of students went to the hospital.  In Uvalde, the assault went uninterrupted for 77 minutes. At UCLA, for four hours.  

What do we want Gene Block to do?  We want him to face his many failures and resign. We  want the same from vice chancellor beck and UCLA PD chief of police John Thomas.   And we demand a transparent student and faculty-overseen outside investigation leading to accountability and major police reform.",-6,1716682104.0,t1_l5o53x5

The so-called ""investigations"" are a sham.  Either we have transparency NOW or we do not an will not, ever. Gene Block won't hold a press conference because he cannot afford to answer questions truthfully for the last four weeks.  Empty promises are not answers. The necessary questions do not take a month to discover answers to.  The answers are already known by those who hide them.  

The only law enforcement agency investigating the unfettered mob attack on 4/30 is the UCLA PD.  Gene Block removed the chief of the UCLA PD and installed a new ""security czar"" from a professional class of police scandal managers.  The man controls the UCLA PD now and answers solely and only to Gene Block.  It's corrupt.  Police who failed students are investigating themselves, yeah right.  

Separately there is an ordered policy review.st Century Policing Solutions is supposedly conducting it, but we've had no transparency from them, nor will you ever get much until they publish whatever worthless twaddle they amass in a years time.   A review is NOT an investigation and they have no subpoena powers.  Given that the administration and the UCLA PD will not give PUBLIC records to the media, in an Open Records Act state, it's extremely unlikely they will cooperate fully and openly with this so-called policy review, either.  Such. review does two things.  It stalls, for at least a year.  Then it ensures the actual records are not produced, by merely forming an opinion paper on the events without publishing the primary documents that were examined.  And it takes a year to complete itself, giving the authorities the immediate and LAME excuse to say, ""I can't comment on an ongoing investigation,"" even thought a review is NOT an investigation.  Here at UCLA they know this is such a sham they havent even hardly worked up to the excuse stage, they simply don't even give out any response at all to reporters questions.  None.  

What we actually have is a corrupt stall and a paid team of spin doctors and scandal managers running a coverup.  Ask Uvalde how the ""investigations"" panned out there.  Every second of video you have seen about that tragic day was LEAKED, not released by any law enforcement agency.  We only know what we know because inside whistleblowers were so disgusted they leaked the truth to the press.  Administrators and authorities there admitted NOTHING and are still fighting the press by appealing the case they lost to give up the public records in an Open Records Act state.  It's corrupt, and openly so.  

These are the ""you want the truth?  You can't handle the truth"" type of people we see in the movies. Brittle, defensive, powerful and GUILTY enough in their own minds to demonstrate they are unwilling to ""play fair.""  I can't prove they are responsible for deliberate terrible acts. I can only see the results.  This is the nature of corrupt power. 

Rick Braziel is the scandal management fixer who is the new ""security czar.""  He performed a similar act for the Uvalde, another instance where police failed to protect students in West Texas and a score of them went to the morgue.  In Westwood, police failed to protect students and more than a score of them went to the hospital.

1d0e85g,l5mz7hz,Jean_dodge67,"When you have lost the confidence of the librarians, that's when it it is time to leave. 

Rather than get off in the weeds of what should have been done or could have been done better, or differently we need to face the fact that on 4/30, Chancellor Gene Block, vice Chancellor Beck, and UCLA PD chief John Thomas left their students for dead, essentially for over four hours.  Had, heaven forbid, one of them been bludgeoned to death by members of a vigilante mob, their body would have lain in that no-man's land until dawn while over 200 law enforcement officers and several platoons of private security guards stood on the sidelines doing nothing.  

Its not the intensity of the attacks that is in question, it is the fact that no matter what was happening on a field of dishonor, there was no response from the administration or the police, none. And the police were there the whole time, in ever increasing numbers, which essentially egged the mob on to see that no reprisals were forthcoming when they increased the levels of violence to the mob's content. (At 1 AM when the LAPD arrived, the thugs chanted ""USA, USA"" as thought the cavalry had arrived - at Sand Creek, at the Washita, At Wounded Knee.)  

If they won't break up a fist fight (and it was way worse than that from the very start) they wouldn't have broken up a knife fight, either.  And if they wouldn't have acted to quell a knife attack they most certainly wouldn't have moved against an attack with firearms.  And that's the only real difference between 4/30/24 in Westwood and 5/24/22 in West Texas at Uvalde's Robb elementary school.  Again, it's not the level of violence, it's the refusal to oppose any of it, it's the principle of whether to move against a mob or to allow a mob free reign for even a moment, much less four hours. It's coward cops protecting themselves first, and students never.  BY THE HUNDREDS, coward cops. 

As the student body, the press and the world saw (through multiple live-streamed videos) if the administration's police force won't protect you from furtive cowardly assaults with improvised clubs, chemical sprays and incendiary devices, they wouldn't have intervened if the violence had drastically escalated, either. These authorities collectively somehow made the decision to let whatever mob violence was happening should continue unabated, and they did so for four hours.  This indicates these authorities are either dangerously incompetent or dangerously incompetent AND complicit in the violence.  

Either way, they have demonstrated they are unfit for the positions they occupy, and that if given the chance they would do it again.  

They must not be given that chance. 

Now, were they to resign forthwith and immediately that would help, but we also must know what went wrong, why they failed.  UCLA PD chief John Thomas has been placed on suspension.  Vice Chancellor Beck has been supplanted with a new head of security. Chancellor Gene Beck refuses to hold a press conference and all the m are refusing requests for records and information regarding the evening of 4/30 from members of the press, including the student newspaper's reporters.  This is not a roadmap to preventing a similar (or worse) disaster.  It's scandal management and corporate slanting via public relations and a coverup. Thus far the main efforts in the wake of this disaster have been to protect Gene Block and vice-chancellor Beck from exposure and accountability.  Hiding in an ivory tower bunker is not what responsible leadership looks like.  

Not to get hyperbolic, but a real university chancellor would have been standing out in that gun smoke and bear spray no-man's land on 4/30 with nothing but his gold-plated stapler from his mahogany desk, protecting his students with his very life, if that was needed.  Instead we see what we have seen - a petty bureaucrat hiding behind his hedge fund and consultants. A coward and a danger to the lives of his students. When leader exemplifies not the best qualities of humanity, but it's worst, it's time for new leadership.     

Gene Block must be suspended pending a transparent and student and faculty supervised investigation.  He can no longer be afforded the public trust and institutional credibility he has squandered.  

Trust and respect are earned, not given.  The ONLY road back for rehabilitating this lost trust, credibility and respect is through ruthless transparency leading to public accountability.  A systemic failure of public safety administrators cannot and will not be fixed by the same system that built it.  It will only be perpetuated, excused, swept under a rug and corruptly allowed to cover itself up. Weeks ago we should all have been openly examining police dash cam and bodycam recordings, public records in an Open Records Act state, and pouring over the text messages and phone logs of the authorities from every agency and department involved.  Instead, it's all hidden, embargoed, walled off.  A stonewall is not an investigation.  It's a stall, a ruse, a doge, a CYA, a bait-and-switch.  There's no mistaking what transparency looks like.  

Gene Block and his new security czar have yet to hold a single press conference.  I've seen no physical proof that newly appointed vice chancellor in charge of security Rick Brazil is even in Los Angeles County, his presence is so guarded from press and student scrutiny and questioning. We've had no updates that were followed by Q and A, none.  Only slanted statement from an ivory tower issued by a committee of professional consultant scandal managers.   I know a snow job when I am getting one and this is a High Sierra blizzard.  

This is the very nature of why a no-confidence posture exists.  We cannot trust Gene Block and his administrators to fix what they do not admit was a grievous and catastrophic failure of student and campus safety and the biggest threat to academic freedom the university has seen in this century.  

A ship captain who abandons his post in a violent storm is no longer a ship's captain, he's simply and obviously a danger to all the crew and passengers, and the ship's mission at sea.  When a token barbarian is arrested at the gate to Rome, that's hardly shutting the gate, it's an admission the invitation is set out for the Goth hordes.  

The proverbial horses have fled and Gene Block won't even admit he's removed the barn doors. UCLA cannot afford to be led by such a figure.",-10,1716658578.0,t3_1d0e85g
1d0e85g,l5n59a2,[deleted],"Yeah, I think a lot of people are significantly underestimating the level of danger here. There's three weeks of the quarter left, hardly any of the members of the violent mob have been held accountable, and Congress has made UCLA a target.

1d0e85g,l5n9rxz,Jean_dodge67,"I agree, but again it's not the individual thugs that are the true danger, it's what they represent, and that's the spectacle and specter of unchecked violence against what were in essence peaceful protesters.  What I witnessed on 4/30 was an opening of a back door to hell.  What came out was, thankfully, only enough ""demons"" to send 25 students to hospital and not the morgue but that was a happenstance completely out of the hands of the relevant authorities charged with student safety.  They abdicated their most basic responsibilities and not for a moment but for an entire evening.  

Gene Block left his students to die on 4/30 and then capitalized on the heinous violence he sanctioned on students to call in the riot squad the next day, and now he hides from the truth and stonewalls the public records in an Open Records Act state that we all need to see made transparent as he awaits accountability from suspension.  **When you cannot hold a press conference it means you have no answers.** 

A leader without answers, without principles leads little but his own interests and does so illegitimately and for corrupt purpose.

Withhold his pension until we have student and faculty oversight, or else assume he will continue in his unchecked power and open failure of duty for selfish gain.

I really must say that millionaires live in different worlds from us. Decimillionaires moreover. Centimillionaires and billionaires are arguably criminal were justice real. 

We are class allies. Humans are not built to work 40-hour workweeks from 22 years old till 65+. What a sad life while the rentier class gets vacations half the year. Half days during winter used to be expected; now we just get seasonal affect disorder. Employers used to pay for our food and allow us midday breaks to eat with family and to nap; now we eat at our desks or skip lunch because we need to pay rent. We are class allies. I think a ~$100k/yr income is less a factor in someone‚Äôs politics than where they were born and went to school.

But neither they nor the people that are middle class remotely understand what it‚Äôs like to live off $20k.",1,1733850360.0,t1_m1cnz97
1harjvy,m1ho7o8,JellyHops,"Sorry you had to deal with such awful behavior. Bullying isn‚Äôt inherently tied to class‚Äîthose people probably just suck in general.

The lack of empathy we experience is a broader feature of societal systems, like capitalism and feudalism. These systems are built to highlight the material differences between classes, making it hard for people to relate or unite. But when you look past these apparent material divides, the human differences among the laboring (non-owning) classes aren‚Äôt that vast.

At the heart of it, our time and happiness are held hostage by the owning class on pain of homelessness and starvation. Our employers pay our landlords, and we‚Äôre just delivery‚Äîwe‚Äôre the extras to the owning class‚Äôs main-character syndrome. They have the police, courts, and lawmakers on their side to uphold their hereditary aristocracy.

The stress of stretching funds to meet both needs and wants can be inarticulable and isolating because of stigma, shame, or the difficulty of explaining its impact. People often dismiss the negative mental health effects of being unable to pursue passions or indulge in creature comforts. We fear seeming vain, vapid, or out-of-touch for wanting things they don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed.‚Äù But some of those ‚Äúwants‚Äù are actually essential.

Whether it‚Äôs struggling to afford makeup, art supplies, or streaming subscriptions, people often get shamed for expecting handouts (from the top) or privilege-checked for not appreciating what they already have (from the bottom). This fosters self-loathing and compounds frustration. Boredom, stress, and low self-esteem are each lethal alone, but our economy seems designed to maximize all three. Shaming people for just wanting to taste the excess fruits of our country‚Äôs economic production isn‚Äôt just cruel‚Äîit‚Äôs actual evil, the kind of villainy writers couldn‚Äôt invent in a million years.

Still, something incredible about people is our minds‚Äô natural bias toward positive memories, which is helping us persevere until we finally get enough people to want to do something about all this.
