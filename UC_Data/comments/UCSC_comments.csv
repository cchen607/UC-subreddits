Not surprising. What, do people think Hamas would suddenly hang up their AK-47s and rocket launchers, restart elections, and allow equality for everyone if Israel and Jews suddenly disappeared? 

Hell no! They'll just move onto a new target. Perhaps a different country in the Middle East, or more likely, the US or another western nation. Their goal, beyond eradicating Jews and destroying Israel, is focused on tearing apart the west.

So far, Hamas is doing a fairly good job of that, sociologically-speaking. It's managed to galvanize hundreds, perhaps thousands of easily swayed (brainwashed?) America, Canadian, British, Australian, and European teenagers and 20-somethings into allying with an organization that'd restrict their rights, freedoms, and likely kill them for any perceived slight.",2,1714935331.0,t1_l2libwa

I think there is a related institional failure at play here too though, in that UCSC doesn't directly provide a Jewish cultural space or resource center on campus.

Hillel and Koret may do plenty of other stuff too, but I do think they are explicitly Zionist:  
- ""Hillel is steadfastly committed to the support of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state"" [https://www.hillel.org/israel-guidelines/](https://www.hillel.org/israel-guidelines/)  
- ""Ensuring a bright future for Israel is one of the Koret Foundation‚Äôs original priorities."" [https://koret.org/priorities/u-s-israel-bridge-building/](https://koret.org/priorities/u-s-israel-bridge-building/)

I'm troubled by the call to cut ties with the Helen Diller Institute, which is a program founded at Berkeley Law with the ""goal of providing a rich academic forum for students and faculty to explore the breadth and complexity of Israel and contemporary Jewish issues."" Pairing a demand to cut ties to an academic institute like this with a demand to ""end academic repression"" and ""protect free speech"" feels particularly odd to me.

The source of their entire movement is really resentment that stems from the weaker or ""oppressed"" group in any situation is morally justified and therefore violence, forced censorship, forced reallocation of wealth and power from the stronger or ""oppressor"" group is justified.  Ultimately this is what they want to do and the same sentiment has been seen on the left across the entire political platform from BLM to feminism.

In other words they will not be satisfied until jewish peoples in general are sufficiently poorer and lacking in power than most seemingly ""oppressed"" groups.

The Hellen Diller foundation is managed by the San Francisco Jewish federation once funded Canary Mission, which is a secretive blacklist of anti-Israel students. This makes them a proIsrael organization not a proJewish organization. 

The Koret foundation Koret Project on Arab-Israel Relations ‚Äúis committed to providing America's policymakers with timely analysis on issues of critical concern to Israel and its Arab neighbors‚Äù. This makes them a lobby group for Israel.

I draw the line at intentionally targeting civilians. Blowing up schools, buses, caf√©s, music festivals, etc. I draw the line at slaughtering women and children in their homes and burning the bodies. I draw the line at rape. That is not resistance. That is barbaric terror. 

If a Hamas rocket were to hit a Jewish daycare and kill 30 children, would that be considered a good thing? Would Hamas get on Al Jazeera and say, ""we are horrified by the loss of life. Those poor children! We meant to hit the army base."" No, Hamas would celebrate. They would consider that to be the most successful rocket fired of all time.

1d0gf4k,l5nzdq2,Persianx6,"1. 60 years? Israel has essentially ruled over what we call Palestine now since the late 1970s. Prior to that, the West Bank belonged to Jordan -- an arab country -- and Gaza belonged to Egypt -- another Arab country.
2. Palestine's current position is a result of Arafat attempting usurpation of the Jordanian crown in what we call Black September. But on the Gaza side, the result is because Islamists killed Anwar Sadat after he negotiated the Sinai peninsulas return to Egypt. One understands that the current Hamas political isolation is due to actions taken to immediate, friendly neighbors, who are now not friendly anymore. 
3. Palestine is hardly poor, but Palestinians are. Bunkers and tunnels cost millions of dollars to construct and Hamas brags, openly, about how much they've made. It comes at the expense of other infrastructure and with money raised from outside Palestine. Hamas has chosen war over and over, why do we act shocked when their choices result in retaliation and a degradation of the peace process?
4. Hamas' resistance would seem noble if Fatah hadn't already recognized Israel as an entity, thereby resulting in the birth of the PA. 
5. PA already has an observer status at the UN and would likely gain full state status, if the PA could negotiate on behalf of Gaza and the West Bank. Since 2006, Abbas has never had this power. Nor has Netanyahu decided to honor this. So in terms of international legal status, the result is a stalemate. Moreover, Abbas has never considered splitting the state into two divisions. So he simply sits and waits for power transfer or for his power to cease. 
6. Non-Hamas Palestinians would kill for peace talks. Considering that the vast majority don't support Hamas, whether living in Israel or in the West Bank, you would actually realize many more want peace -- though are wary of such -- more than historic retribution.  It should be noted that Hamas' army is 50,000 people out of a reported population of 4 million, in the territories. If you add in 2 million more Arabs in Israel, whom are counted as ""Israeli Arabs"" and whom are even more moderate and often more secular leaning than Hamas and Fatah, you begin to understand why Hamas' call for Palestinians to universally join the war, has resulted in very few doing so. Hamas is on an island unto itself. 
7. If Palestine is united under the PA rather than split between the two parties, the highest likelihood is that there would be peace talks with the framework for a state -- the 1967 borders -- as being generally agreed on.
8. Hamas' unilateral rejection of even the 1948 borders is why they keep fighting wars and dying in stupid fashion. They do not have the power to maintain their war, there is no reason for the wars besides being stubborn.",14,1716673443.0,t1_l5nutr6

The Bureau of Indian Affairs was literally formed to systemically genocide the native peoples here. 
 So yes, if you are settled in the states and are not indigenous to here, you have benefitted from the genocide of the Native Americas in the same way Israel benefits from the ongoing genocide and displacement of the Palestinian people. The United States did this to the Indigenous Americans way before Israel as a country existed. WW2- Hilter himself literally drew inspiration from Eugenics tactics the United States was using on Black and Indigenous peoples (not to name many other marginalized peoples).

So it doesn‚Äôt deserve the right to exist much in the same way the U.S, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, much of Latin America, etc. shouldn‚Äôt exist in their current political forms. That‚Äôs not saying the entire population that‚Äôs there will be sent back to their ancestors homeland (I.e none of these Zionists from the State of Israel are ‚Äúnative‚Äù to the land, their ancestry is mostly Europe and the West in general) they‚Äôd exist in a different capacity similarly to how Russians in the Soviet Union just continued living in Russia.  A lot of people are commenting about how the Hamas Charter states the extermination of all Jews, but not the context. Yes that was during its creation in 1988 and even Hamas leaders acknowledge that should‚Äôve been specified and clarified with the times. Since then, it‚Äôs been rewritten and clarified in 2017 to specify Zionists as the primary enemy.    

The point about number 2: you try having your home, homeland and people subjugated and stolen for close to so much of your existence. Of course it‚Äôs going to state ‚Äúunder any means necessary‚Äù.

I do care, but I also understand that war is not genocide, and Hamas instigated this war. Israel is fighting against the racist, sexist, homophobic, terroristic, authoritarian dictatorship that will stop at nothing to destroy it. Its end goal (stated) is the complete eradication of Christianity and Judaism. And if the region returns to the status quo, Hamas will remain in power in Gaza, and has claimed that they will commit more terrorist attacks in Israel. Therefore, Israel MUST, and WILL win this war. It is the only liberal democracy in the Middle East and is easily the freest country in the entire region.

Hamas should stop hiding military operations underneath schools and hospitals and launching rockets from extremely populated areas to guarantee civilian casualties. They should also stop stealing aid and fucking off to Qatar where they live lavishly while their civilians die.

1cfk82i,l1t4gdr,willardTheMighty,"At the same time, colleges are stewards of public funds and if they can make stickers/posters without paying artists then it‚Äôs a responsible decision in that sense. 

It makes me think of the example from the first chapter of Karl Marx‚Äôs *Capital*. A sweater may cost ¬£10.00 because a worker could make one in a day and they need to charge that much in order to survive; you‚Äôre paying for the labor. But upon the invention of the garment factory, where a worker could make 10 sweaters per day, the cost of a sweater dropped to ¬£1.00! The seamstress making the sweater by hand might still need to charge ¬£10.00 in order to survive, but the *market value of her labor* has decreased because machines can do it much faster and at lower cost. Similarly, the market value of an artist‚Äôs labor in making a sticker or poster has decreased since the emergence of AI art. It‚Äôs not fair to insist that we only buy sweaters from the seamstress and not the factory; to insist that we pay more when we can get the same product at 1/10th the price.

The only difference is that wealthier people have options outside of dining halls because they can spend more to get around the city and eat out at pricier places.

As for stealing, is the university's greed not the same? Does sending a message that hurts the dining hall and not the students not directly tell the university to get their heads out their asses?

By playing the role of the world police, the US has an immense influence on‚Ä¶ well everything. Simply put, the US has a seat at every important table. The US has a say in every major world event. This means the US gets the better end of a foreign trade deal most of the time. Why do you think the US dollar is THE universal currency? By maintaining a powerful influence world wide, the US dollar becomes a very strong currency. A strong dollar means imported goods from outside the US (basically anything that says ‚ÄúMade in not-USA‚Äù) would be cheaper for YOU, the consumer, while US exported goods would be worth more. 

Generally speaking, capitalism works best in stable, democracy-led countries, which means by playing the world police, the US can shape the world to its desired state to do business with. That kind of impact on a global scale is invaluable. 

TLDR: The money the US uses to buy influence and allies around the world pays off, by a lot. ‚ÄúMoney buys friends‚Äù they say, and having friends all over the world makes for a good economy.",3,1716277450.0,t1_l4z5ugr

Well you‚Äôre still proving my point correct. Good for you for helping high school or younger students. Jobs don‚Äôt care about your tutors/mentors from before university. College internships are important for getting a job, and that‚Äôs what these defense companies provide. 

&gt; it‚Äôs interesting to see how many people comment in bad faith like they think I‚Äôm trying to start an argument

It‚Äôs no so much people think you‚Äôre starting an argument but they are countering your statement. It‚Äôs one thing that there‚Äôs a military industrial complex it‚Äôs another to make up a term like ‚Äúmilitary industrial academic complex‚Äù just bc the university helps student connect to internships by companies in that sector or pursue joint research endeavors. Schools also connect students with internships and do partnership projects in a variety of sectors, such as tech, medicine, teaching, and government. Do private schools like Stanford cease to be private universities bc they collaborate with the government in research and job opportunities? No, and no one makes up a bogus phrase for it like private-government complex schools. Universities just try to provide their students with career experiences and grow their research output, and that will include military weapons companies bc there‚Äôs plenty of people that get degrees in physics, engineering, etc. and it would be incredibly pathetic to not support those students or industries bc some other people are upset military weapons get used in wars they disagree with it.

He was busy, and in addition to the regular academic work, he asked a TA for one of his classes to do some extra work for him.  The understanding was that Ben was going to be moving and did want to take his older car with him when he left.  He was going to give the car to the TA when he moved in exchange for the work.  When the time came for him to move he decided that he didn‚Äôt want to give the car to the TA and also didn‚Äôt compensate the TA for the additional work for him.

This meant you could get up to the treehouse from a 5-6 foot ladder, and on the other side of the circle it would be about a 40-50ft drop off (anyone please feel free to check my estimations). In the middle of the circle on the ground there was a small area cleared of brush that would be used as the arena.

One source of internal conflict for me has been the awareness that similar atrocities (and worse) are occurring every few years all over the world, yet we take almost no notice of them: South Sudan, Darfur, the Tamils in Sri Lanka, it goes on and on. The more educated I get, the more I feel I should be doing, and yet the more powerless I feel. What I have landed on is that we, as Americans, bear more responsibility for Palestine because our government is funding it and supplying a lot of the weapons. But even with Palestine, the amount we can directly affect is so limited. Even if we can pressure the UC Regents to sell off all their S&amp;P 500 index funds and their T-bills, I don't see any path by which that affects Israeli military policy even slightly.

1d5r4c9,l6nt477,OhNothing13,"Yeah that's one point the pro-Israel crowd does correctly make: what's happening in Gaza is happening all around the world on a fairly frequent basis. Maybe not with the number of bombs or the level of military tech Israel has access to, but there are ethnic massacres happening all the time that major news networks completely ignore. That's one thing I've found Al Jazeera to be good for, they tend to mention conflicts and violence that CNN and FOX would never cover. 

In addition, the US also funds other countries (like Saudi Arabia in Yemen) that are committing war crimes very similar to Israel's, but Israel consistently gets more attention. Personally, I think that's more a function of how loudly invested many Jewish Americans are in Israel vs. how Yemeni Americans don't have that kind of voice, but antisemitism probably also plays a part in it. 

The whole divestment thing though...I just don't get it. Asking for that really IS like asking the universities to reject capitalism and the United States military. Israel is so intertwined with the military industrial complex at this point, and the military industrial complex is so baked into our economic system that meeting SJP's demands is never gonna happen. I think what you suggested, reaching out to representatives to influence US foreign policy, is much more effective.

Glad to clear that up.

&gt;You are cheering on Hamas just because they are losing.

Oh, pal...a coupla things:

1. I am not ""cheering on"" Hamas, but I can understand how the zionist tunnel blindness might make you think that way.
2. By every single metric, Israel is losing. Let's do the numbers:

* Is Hamas destroyed? In October BB stated it would take ""6 or 7 months.""  How's that working out? Fun fact: Hamas membership is BOOMING.  Apparently they have more applicants than arms.  Gosh, who coulda guessed that if you wipe out a whole family, the survivors might turn to ever more violent responses in increasing numbers?
* Have the hostages been returned?  Hamas tried to offer a deal WAY back in October 9th.  But isn't it great how Israel's invasion is proceeding...aCcOrDiNg To \*(cough) PlAn?
* How's Israel's rep as a fierce sabra in the desert, doing?  Oh wait, that's right.  IRAN attacked, and Israel responded...by hitting a radar installation.  LMAO!
* How about Israel's international rep?  How's that...heh...hahah...ahahaha! Sorry, I just can't finish the sentence.  Pretty obv how they're doing on the world stage.
* And Israel's economy...it must be BOOMING. I mean, war generally stimulates economies.  Right?  Nnnope.
* And how about Israel's core purpose--to provide a safe space for Jews?  Well gosh: I think about 100,000 Israelis' having to evacuate the North b/c of Hezbollah, might have something to say about that (to say nothing of the rise of antisemitism, overall)...

&gt;It is a very terrible thing they started a war, but it is a very good thing they are losing.

You remind me so much of Saddam Hussein's Chief of Staff on the day the US invaded...offering assurances to the reporters that everything's ""under control:"" even as the US bombs are rattling the State buildings in Baghdad with ""Shock and Awe.""

I am in no way attempting to minimize the events you mentioned. I made sure to word it as ""amongst the worst"" and ""one of the worst"" for this very reason since there have unfortunately been many horrific world events that I am both aware and even unaware of (something that id be happy to be informed or educated about). However, if my comment came off in a way that did in any way make you or anyone else feel like I am speaking down on or minimizing other world tragedies then I truly apologize. I was mainly focused on this event since this is directly related to what I've witnessed and discussed on campus recently. The purpose of my comment was not to create arguments over what is more tragic (tragedy is tragedy I don't believe it should be a competition over what was worse), and I am open to and appreciate any discussion on events and points of view in which I am not fully educated on.

Your second point about being foolish to believe that people will set aside their differences to understand one another‚Äôs opposing beliefs is not necessarily foolish.

1d5r4c9,l6poihk,Beardmanta,"And it makes sense. 

There's a narrative that Palestines in Israeli prisons are unjust

The Gilad Shalit afair tells a very different story. The 1,027 Palestine prisoners released for him included Sinwar who orchestrated the October 7th attack. Dozens of other prisoners released that day have engaged in other terrorist attacks killing 6 Israeli civilians in July of 2015 for example, multiple have participated in the development and firing of unguided rockets into Israeli cities. It also led to a $1m bounty funded by various Arab states for the live capture of Israeli soldiers. All for the release of 1 man.

You do NOT give the tantruming child the candy unless you want more tantrums. (Replace tantrums with brutal murder, kidnapping, and rape, if the analogy isn't obvious enough.) Negotiating with terrorists just encourages more terrorism.

If I was the family or the hostages I'd want them back at any cost, but it's the duty of the government to think of the lives of the country as a whole. Massive prisoner exchanges (especially when Hamas insists on insane ratios like 1,000 Palestinians to 1 Israeli) should be rejected. It will just lead to hundreds of not thousands of more deaths/kidnappings. 

Hamas needs to be removed before any peace can be achieved. If the hostages can be freed along the way that's ideal, but there's no version of a peaceful Middle East that can exist with radical jihadist in control of Gaza.",1,1717294862.0,t1_l6pajkh

My issue is 100% with the actions of the Israeli government not the Israeli people themselves. I believe they are also suffering immense pain over the attack and ongoing hostage situation and the ongoing situation in general. My heart goes out to all the people suffering from the war right now,  including the Israeli people. I am also not at all empathetic to Hamas AT ALL and wanted to clear that up. I do believe the Israeli government deserves blame as well, but if my post came off as putting blame soely on Israel for what happened or used language that suggested that I do apologize for that was far from my intention. As I stated previously,  I cannot align myself with SJP in part because I cannot align myself with or support an organization like Hamas cause they are also committing horrible atrocities as well. I hope that doesn't get lost in the dialogue as the evil perpretated by both governments must be acknowledged. As I stated several times in my post,  immense violence does not justify immense violence.

However, if I failed to get that across in an effective manner I do apologize.

Just wanted to say thank you for the responses. I don't use Reddit very often and was a little nervous about posting my feelings. I was honestly a little uncomfortable at first when I saw how many people were responding but I've been happy with most of the comments on here and if like thank everyone who has and is partaking in civil discussion on the ongoing situation in Gaza. If also like to thank people for offering their different point of views and knowledge on the matter and I've been very appreciative of being able to build upon my own views and knowledge on the matter. 

One of the things is like to address is regarding the reference of the events in Gaza as a genocide. I've come to understand that as of right now it is not currently a responsible way to refer to the events as such,  though in no way does that minimize or downplay what's currently happening as it's still a incredibly sad and horrifying situation regardless of what we choose to refer it as. There's a lot of weight to that word, and I understand the sensitivity to it, so until the powers at be  declare it as such, I will be refraining from referring to the events as such. I will not be editing my current post since it's already very long to include this comment and since I believe in being held accountable for my statements and editing them to reflect this change in view may be taken as misleading or dishonest.

Previously, hundreds of thousands of Jews were living relatively peacefully among other residents of the area. Jewish Zionists either destroyed or stole the homes of their neighbors, and literally renamed their cities to Hebrew names.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba

&gt;The Nakba (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÜŸéŸëŸÉŸíÿ®Ÿéÿ© an-Nakba, lit. 'the catastrophe') was the ethnic cleansing[1] of Palestinians in Mandatory Palestine during the 1948 Palestine war through their violent displacement and dispossession of land, property, and belongings, along with the destruction of their society, and the suppression of their culture, identity, political rights, and national aspirations.[2] The term is also used to describe the ongoing persecution and displacement of Palestinians by Israel.[3] As a whole, it covers the fracturing of Palestinian society and the long-running rejection of the right of return for Palestinian refugees and their descendants.[4][5]

&gt;During the Nakba in 1948, approximately half of Palestine's predominantly Arab population, or around 750,000 people,[6] were expelled from their homes or made to flee, at first by Zionist paramilitaries through various violent means, and after the establishment of the State of Israel, by the Israel Defense Forces. This occurred in the wake of dozens of massacres targeting Palestinian Arabs and the depopulation of 500 Arab-majority towns and villages,[7] with many of these being either completely destroyed or repopulated by Jews and given new Hebrew names. By the end of the war, 78% of the total land area of the former Mandatory Palestine was controlled by Israel and at least 15,000 Palestinian Arabs had been killed.",0,1717342439.0,t1_l6qjjmk

Nobody is disputing that 700,000 Palestinians were displaced in the decade following WW2. But it was from a combination of voluntary relocation, encouragement from Arab leaders, and (yes) persecution by Jews in what is now Israel.

As to whether it will be engaging at UCSC, that's a different matter - bachelor's degree in math can be achieved just about anywhere and UCs tend to cater math programs more toward post graduate research. 

If you wanna go into private equity, a bachelor's in math is a less likely path to get you there. Private equity jobs look for business or analysis skills and math might help in an indirect way, but getting a job in private equity depends more on your connections than the undergraduate degree you earn. Undergrad is minimum just to get your foot in the door for tech and especially private equity (tech jobs prefer candidates have a bachelor's, but don't necessarily require it whereas the vast majority of private equity jobs will require an undergrad degree if not 99% of the time)",1,1717490787.0,t1_l719hop

Intifada: shake down/uprising literal translation. Use in Palestine/israel: references a multiple of violent terrorist attacks against Jews over the span of decades. People in your school community literally have family members killed during these intifadas.

Intifada revolution / globalize the intifada: do the above everywhere!!!  Now couple this with all of the white supremacists who hate Jews manipulating well intended college kids into furthering their cause and literally creating violence and disorder for college students across the country.

There is only one solution: blatant reference to Hitler ‚ÄúThe Final Solution‚Äù
If it wasn‚Äôt, then why on earth was this the choice of words? Why is this even a sentiment? Some people I have talked to (and know in person) who are super pro Palestine have told me (a Jewish person) that their cause does not go against a two state solution. A Palestinian acquaintance of mine from school actually specifically told me this. 
 
So logically, why is this anti-Israel activism the only solution? The only solution to what? A free Palestine? Free how? Who is leading each? Who allowed to live where? 

Does anyone in Palestine/israel agree to a 1 state solution at this time? Does either group feel they‚Äôd be safe in a country that consisted of full integration of both groups??? Obviously there has *not* been one solution figured out or it would have already been enacted. 

So what exactly does this phrase mean??? To me it sounds like it is very specifically designed to be intimidating and reference hitlers slaughter of Jews. For me personally who also has a disability, I‚Äôm double triggered by this since Hitler also killed, experimented on, and effectively tortured all kinds of disabled people and allegedly it‚Äôs a progressive cause to encourage lawful eugenics (facilitating ‚Äòlegal suicide‚Äô for treatable disabilities)

Just the other week I read an article written by a person with the same mental illness as me published in a reputable source saying her life was so miserable she should be allowed to die because treatment doesn‚Äôt help her. Was this my one solution to my medication resistant bipolar depression? It‚Äôs not. I fought for 3 years to try a seizure medication I read about that‚Äôs explicitly approved to treat bipolar depression which 3 prior incompetent doctors either refused to consider or prescribe for reasons that equated to nothing more than they were uneducated about this option for me. It isn‚Äôt a new drug. It isn‚Äôt newly approved for this problem either. And Guess what? It works amazing  for me and now I have felt fine for 2 years after not feeling normal since I was 12. 

The answer to all of this horrible rhetoric and ideology is more compassion, more understanding, and more respect for people who have problems you don‚Äôt understand. For example disabled people. 

For a more relevant overall example, many of your Zionist Jewish student peers who are offended, intimidated, and scared, to whom being a Zionist means absolutely nothing beyond believing in the existence of a state entitled to Jewish self determination.

Actually my takeaway, and same with my brother when he went, was that damn it sucks here thank god I was born in America. Too much racism and too many bombs flying from both groups.

Some of us actually have analyzed everything about the situation and yet your comment indicates and insinuates that only you have analyzed the situation and that anyone who holds a different analysis than you is in the wrong. If you hold the belief that students marching and occupying buildings on campus is wrong, power to you. IDF agrees with you and even bombed universities in Gaza (in addition to many buildings apart from universities) to prove it.

There's a high sense of irony I sense in the retort that ""y'all (aren't analyzing anything and are) doing this (futile activity)"". I don't disagree that some tactics and actions could be better executed; but the premise of this specific thread of comments insinuates that any action on campus which disrupts regularly scheduled activities is bad simply because one student posted that it makes them feel anxious. Inducing anxiety upon those who will be affected by actions is absolutely a point of consideration that organizers and ""activists"" should always consider. Ultimately, the call to still make and take action in spite of a few anxieties of a few people is one that organizers and activists should take responsibility for. But the voices that should be centered in any actions should be the voices and experiences of the most marginalized. In this case, the most marginalized voices are those of Palestinian people who are being targeted and murdered by the IDF (which is brazenly giving the middle finger to the entire world with regard to human rights and international laws). If students and faculty don't agree with the idea of respect for basic human rights and laws, then maybe they shouldn't be learning or teaching at a public institution which holds such values.",-1,1716326408.0,t1_l52qo9d

&gt; Born a Crime is an autobiography and details Trevor Noah's personal struggle with apartheid. Not sure what it has to do with student protestors in America.

His memoir is about more than just that. He was born and lived through the fall of apartheid. It wasn't divestment that took it down. It was the people that stayed at the table. College students protesters did nothing but write glowing articles about themselves and then moved on to their next cause de jour.  Meanwhile, native Africans ended up starving and fighting each other in the streets over limited resources, which prolonged Apartheid. 

Read *Sanctions on South Africa: What Did They Do?* by Philip Levy. He was working at the Economic Research and Analysis Unit in Geneva at that time. The divestment erased decades of work done by the people in South Africa to take down Apartheid. It was already coming apart when the student protests began.

The issue is they have no incentive to do this because for every UCSC student that gets on they bill the school, regardless of where they get on or off.

Individual students similarly have no incentive to self regulate because it doesn't cost them anything directly to ride a METRO bus between two campus stops. They're already paying for unlimited rides through fees.

In other words, rational self-interest all around. The incentives need to change to really make a difference. I graduated from this school 10 years ago and this was already a major issue then.",2,1715230807.0,t3_1cnehq4

Thing is, the University actually runs a more limited loop bus schedule specifically because it's understood that the Metro buses should also be used for the same purpose. If people stopped using the Metro's as loops, the loops would be overflowing at peak times.

Also, the cost of the Metro buses is baked into student fees. With very few students actually using them to regularly go on and off campus, this is those students literally just using the bare minimum of a service they've paid for.

Before someone chimes in and says they should just add more loops, that isn't exactly a good solution either. That would just mean an excessive number of buses on campus, more environmental/traffic impact, increased student fees, and money being wasted on the UC's massive contract with Metro (which basically subsidizes the entire Metro operation BTW, it would be insolvent if it weren't for the UC contract).

All that said, I always tried to be cognizant if a bus was full and people looked like they were trying to head off campus. That is a courtesy message worth spreading IMO.

1cxipqs,l53se1n,Ok_Patience_167,"Well i agree with this sentiment to an extent. However we are  a democracy and the leader of the free world and that does come with some responsibility and strategic incentive to support our democratic allies globally. I don‚Äôt claim to know exactly what form and amount that aid should take and exactly to which allies.  I don‚Äôt think anyone can answer that question perfectly and it‚Äôs a dynamic situation.  

There is an extreme divide on the issue of aid to Israel and divestment right now although I am not sure if we really know how many Americans feel one way or the other.  It is likely that many fall somewhere in the middle but like so much of US politics right now we have been a fractured country with extreme positions taking a lot of the limelight.  

On the one side you have those who would immediately stop every penny of aid to Israel immediately and divest every dime.  This is based on the current situation on the ground in Palestine with the immediate state of conflict, injuries, casualties, malnutrition, need for medical supplies etc that the Palestinians are suffering.  
No one I think is in any dispute of the current situation and how horrible it is.  There have been some serious questions raised as to exact numbers and it seems as if the UN had been able to verify half the amount of deaths at this point that were reported by the authorities in Gaza.  

A big difference is whether it is phrased as a resistance to genocide or another stage of war in a long long war.  
In the other end of the spectrum is Israelis stance in how it claims it needs to defend itself at the moment and to be proactive in rioting at Hamas which is in control in Palestine and literally hurried underground in tunnels, shelled to a large extent by design behind schools and hospitals which makes the avoidance of innocent bloodshed nearly impossible in Israel‚Äôs attempt to eradicate Hamas.  For a long.time the mainstream consensus was that Hamas were clearly bad actors and basically evil terrorists that would stop at anything.  However now I would say that there is some softening of that position at least by certain extreme Pro Palestinian tropa like the SJP who has been leading this protest.  Or in any event they do not care to focus on that so much as they wish to focus on the fact that the atrocities and state of ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù of Palestinian lives is to a point where Hamas is somehow besides the point.  

Which brings me to the final divide between the two factions : the very right of Israel to exist .  As mentioned SJP sees this as a rightful resistance answer some characterize it as an apartheid (which brings up other pints of debate).  Israel does not basically see this conflict as a ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù but rather as a war and the very fight for the existence of Israel.  SJP has in its central mission that Israel is a colonial white supremacist state that should never have been created and should cease to exist.  They call Zionism, the support for a Jewish homeland nation,  evil and wrong. They have not stated where exactly they think that Israelis should relocate which many find puzzling.  However the Jewish have been there historically in this region thousands of years ago before exiled various times and persecuted across the globe etc.  After WWII there were negotiations between Egypt and Britain to enable Jews to return to this region, to buy land and repopulate it.  This repopulation began to a large extent in late 1800s and early 1900s as well with so much persecution of Jews in Europe.  Well long story short for the past 70‚Äôyears they never really did get the kinks out in terms of who has the exact right to what region.  It was always supposed to be a two state solution and in an ideal world it would have functioned much better than it has with Palestinians having autonomy and the ability to thrive as a people in their own land.

However there is also a real question over whether the Muslim world or at least extreme factions of the Muslim Arab world ever really wanted or would ever agree to allow this to happen.   Hence the failure of something like 5 attempts at two state solutions to enable peace over the past 70 years.  Botched attempts of diplomacy with extremism on both sides, attacks, bombings.  It appears that SJP feels that a two state solution is just impossible and therefore Israel needs to go.  On the other hand there are extremists in Israel who feel the same about Palestine .  There are however many Zionists like myself who want to see all hostages returned and ton alleviate the suffering of innocents on both sides and who want nothing more than a two state solution, for these two nations to somehow miraculously do-exist.  Both extreme sides would likely call me a dreamer .   I know have left out a lot of the exact detail of the exact force used at different times and how one side would call it defensive and the other oppressive etc  also there is a broader context of countries and players that surround and complicate this conflict .  but I do hope that anyone could read this and see that I did try to be objective in my overall characterization of this whole still communicating my individual opinion..",16,1716339751.0,t1_l5387jg

1cxipqs,l53g83y,BananaSloots,"Thanks for your genuine question, and I'm glad to see at least a few helpful responses. I try not to waste my time responding here because this Reddit leans towards folks who complain or argue in bad faith. To the people reducing the protests to ""virtue signaling"", I'd point out that many, many folks said that about BLM protests in 2020, yet that did result in changes across many cities and police departments (though not nearly enough) across the country and sparked important conversations that continue to today. Anyway, I've hyperlinked a bunch of things I mention here to sources, some of which are behind paywalls, which you can find your way around using [https://12ft.io/](https://12ft.io/), and many sources vary from the Times of Israel to Al Jazeera.

To your question, [the protest is due to the involvement and investment of several American universities](https://www.timesofisrael.com/at-heart-of-protests-sweeping-us-universities-is-demand-they-divest-from-israel/), including the UC, [in American and Israeli companies and organizations that are supporting the current Israeli military campaign (now recognized as a genocide) in Gaza](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/13/usuniversity-ties-to-weapons-contractors-under-scrutiny-amid-war-in-gaza). As some have pointed out the UC invests money directly (only about $54 million) and indirectly (billions) into these companies. [One point of the protests is to divest this spending, and instead work with the fund managers to set up socially responsible funds.](https://apnews.com/article/california-regents-university-divestment-israel-a10e121cfa68badab77efc65d8ea1925) At the very least, many UCSC protestors are asking for **funding transparency at the very least** (as was done in UC Berkeley) and **various levels of divestment and re-investment** as options for moving forward.

The bombs killing women and children are sold by the US and despite calls to not supply the genocide, the [US still sells weapons and technologies to the IDF](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/03/06/us-weapons-israel-gaza/) though most recently, there's been a [pause](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/which-bombs-has-the-united-states-stopped-shipping-to-israel), but not cessation. [The algorithms and tech of these weapons, military technologies, surveillance technologies, and other offensive tools were developed by American universities and partnerships.](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/bird-hls) On our campus alone, many of our departments' research is funded through DARPA (the military) and [the advancements made in that research can be used in the military for their own purposes, including trading or giving that knowledge to other militaries in deals.](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/expanded-agenda-us-israel-partnership-new-technologies-new-opportunities) At the moment, none of this is transparent to the researchers and graduate students working on our research.

Will this protest be effective? I don't know. Is it useless? I don't think so. UC Divest has been trying to call attention to this issue for literal decades, through discussion and arbitration and yes some protesting, and it's resulted in some change but not enough. Are the protests anti-Semitic? With many Jewish supporters for the protest (including many of the organizers in the undergrad and grad movements), it's hard to make that claim, but that'll be up to each member of the Jewish community. Hope this helps!",29,1716334591.0,t3_1cxipqs
1cxipqs,l572i3v,commissionersgordons,"A few fact checks:

Israel's actions have not been [legally found to meet the threshold of the legal term ""genocide.""](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g9g63jl17o) This is why journalists and other objective observers continue to avoid the term (despite all of the criticism of media bias, you cannot simply parrot powerful accusations like this without factual basis). Israel has committed war crimes, as has Hamas. Hence, the International Criminal Court's [issuance of arrest warrants for top Israeli and Hamas leaders](https://apnews.com/article/icc-khan-netanyahu-070941d21ccd1f2b9611032b88527575). Obviously, scale is important to consider when judging the depths of the atrocities, and the tens of thousands of innocent Palestinians who are now dead because of Israel's bombardment of Gaza is enormous in comparison to the 1,200 dead after the Hamas attack. Neither are excusable, but scale does matter when it comes to human life.

The [BIRD program](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/bird-hls) you linked to is hardly a reflection of overarching complicity by American universities in war. The program issues $2.5 million a year in research grants. That is quite small.

That's not to say there isn't federal funding linked to DoD in American universities. But, for instance, the Army Corps of Engineers is part of DoD, so a project related to infrastructure might be receiving DoD money ‚Äî there isn't a direct line between DoD funding and pro-war complicity.

The other part of all this that is conflated, as pointed out elsewhere in this thread, is endowments and investment portfolios, which is distinct from research funding, or food/housing costs. Does the National Science Foundation, one of the largest government funders of research (including climate change, conservation, medical, public health, and all that good stuff) also have an investment portfolio that includes weapons and military? [Yes](https://new.nsf.gov/news/8-ways-national-science-foundation-supports-our). Does your retirement fund? Yes. Do most of the companies whom we purchase from? Yes.

The fundamental issue here¬†‚Äî and the reason [why divestment often isn't effective](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248088063/divest-divestment-university-college-protesters-campus-israel-gaza-invasion) ‚Äî is that the global economy is incredibly complex, and is reflective of all the good and bad human behaviors that exist.

I know there‚Äôs a lot for OP to take in and process, but I‚Äôll try to cover a few view points, but these are just my opinions and I can‚Äôt speak for others.

UC school system has investments and research intertwined with Israel.

Israel is not a real democracy because it displaced and killed those that opposed it along the way while importing like minded thinkers till it had the votes to call itself a democracy. Gerrymandering on the most extreme side.

Apartheid. It‚Äôs no secret if we talk about the double standards. One should acknowledge the standards of living of Israeli Jews to Israeli Arabs. There are laws in the books favoring Jews in Israel. Then there is the Palestinian Arabs standard of living. They can‚Äôt even collect rain water because it‚Äôs considered property of Israel.

What does it have to do with the US and us?
There are laws in the US that support Israeli interests which is weird to support a foreign government.

I believe the creation of Israel was a mistake that needs correcting. A 2 state solution is not a good one in my opinion. I recommend the Millet system under one Palestinian state while returning the land stolen during the creation of Israel.

1cxipqs,l54r2ed,Accomplished-Card239,"Your statement reflects two fundamental misconceptions. The first is that it asks what the Palestinians want, as if those in a position to negotiate peace represent the will of the Palestinian public. The Palestinians have never had a true representative democracy. The average Palestinian deals primarily with his or her own day to day existence. They accept without question or dissent the rhetoric and propaganda fed to them by their leaders whose agenda was fixed, in the case of the Palestine Liberation Organization, by the Arab League, which founded the organization in 1964, three years before the Six Day War left Israel in control of the Jordanian occupied ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù, led by the Egyptian born Yasser Arafat, and in the case of Hamas, by their parent organization, the Moslem Brotherhood, also based in Egypt.
The second misconception relates to the term Peace. It is a word with a wide variety of subjective meanings. Peace to some is simply the absence of war. To some it is a state of mind. Israelis see peace as what will exist once the conflict has been resolved and put behind us. For Palestinians that is not possible because Israel's very existence is an affront to them. No one wants to be subjected to the horrors of warfare, but no one wants peace at the price of unconditional surrender, either. Their claim to Palestine can never be resolved as long as Israel exists. At best they can be mollified and set aside their aspirations of restoring what was.
The Palestinian public and the international community have been bombarded by decades of propaganda of Israeli atrocities and repression, which has been used to justify Palestinian violence from suicide bombings through rocket barrages on Israeli cities and neighborhoods. While these are not acts of people who desire Peace, the support by the Palestinian public of these acts reflects a sincere belief on their part that they are legitimate reprisals for what they have been brainwashed to believe Israel has done to them.
So to argue that Palestinian violence against Israelis prove they do not want peace is not necessarily accurate. It could simply mean that Palestinians want peace but only a peace that in their view addresses their perceived grievances.
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes Palestinian are at peace as long as they want to be. They are nearly all governed by a Palestinian government, hardly different in practice from what would exist had they achieved independence. Conditions are not significantly worse than in other Arab countries, and for some they are better. When they initiate hostilities against Israelis that peace is shattered, but it is by their own choice, and ultimately peaceful conditions are restored whenever they decide to end their hostilities, because for Israelis there is nothing to be gained by prolonging the state of conflict.
So really the parties who do not want peace, those who are responsible for sustaining conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, are those involved in disseminating propaganda against Israel, in a clear effort to prevent the Palestinian public from moving forward towards a mutually beneficial negotiated solution. Those are the people who are unwilling to tolerate the existence of a non-Arab entity within what they would like to be an exclusively Arab Middle East.
Those of you who accept at face value allegations against Israel by sources with an interest in the vilification of Israel, those who don't question the veracity of the claims used to incite violence and prevent reconcilliation, are allowing themselves to be manipulated to prevent the Palestinians from achieving peace. If you support Peace don't allow yourself to be used as a tool to prevent peace. Don't parrot the lies of apartheid and genocide and the progressively more absurd claims of Israeli atrocities. Learn the objective facts. Use your intelligence. Open your eyes and see the true agenda of the people you are supporting. Do they promote cooperation, compromise, coexistence?

Our (American people) vision reflects two fundamental misconceptions. The first is that it asks what the Palestinians want, as if those in a position to negotiate peace represent the will of the Palestinian public. The Palestinians have never had a true representative democracy. The average Palestinian deals primarily with his or her own day to day existence. They accept without question or dissent the rhetoric and propaganda fed to them by their leaders whose agenda was fixed, in the case of the Palestine Liberation Organization, by the Arab League, which founded the organization in 1964, three years before the Six Day War left Israel in control of the Jordanian occupied ‚ÄúWest Bank‚Äù, led by the Egyptian born Yasser Arafat, and in the case of Hamas, by their parent organization, the Moslem Brotherhood, also based in Egypt.
The second misconception relates to the term Peace. It is a word with a wide variety of subjective meanings. Peace to some is simply the absence of war. To some it is a state of mind. Israelis see peace as what will exist once the conflict has been resolved and put behind us. For Palestinians that is not possible because Israel's very existence is an affront to them. No one wants to be subjected to the horrors of warfare, but no one wants peace at the price of unconditional surrender, either. Their claim to Palestine can never be resolved as long as Israel exists. At best they can be mollified and set aside their aspirations of restoring what was.
The Palestinian public and the international community have been bombarded by decades of propaganda of Israeli atrocities and repression, which has been used to justify Palestinian violence from suicide bombings through rocket barrages on Israeli cities and neighborhoods. While these are not acts of people who desire Peace, the support by the Palestinian public of these acts reflects a sincere belief on their part that they are legitimate reprisals for what they have been brainwashed to believe Israel has done to them.
So to argue that Palestinian violence against Israelis prove they do not want peace is not necessarily accurate. It could simply mean that Palestinians want peace but only a peace that in their view addresses their perceived grievances.
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes Palestinian are at peace as long as they want to be. They are nearly all governed by a Palestinian government, hardly different in practice from what would exist had they achieved independence. Conditions are not significantly worse than in other Arab countries, and for some they are better. When they initiate hostilities against Israelis that peace is shattered, but it is by their own choice, and ultimately peaceful conditions are restored whenever they decide to end their hostilities, because for Israelis there is nothing to be gained by prolonging the state of conflict.
So really the parties who do not want peace, those who are responsible for sustaining conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, are those involved in disseminating propaganda against Israel, in a clear effort to prevent the Palestinian public from moving forward towards a mutually beneficial negotiated solution. Those are the people who are unwilling to tolerate the existence of a non-Arab entity within what they would like to be an exclusively Arab Middle East.
Those of you who accept at face value allegations against Israel by sources with an interest in the vilification of Israel, those who don't question the veracity of the claims used to incite violence and prevent reconcilliation, are allowing themselves to be manipulated to prevent the Palestinians from achieving peace. If you support Peace don't allow yourself to be used as a tool to prevent peace. Don't parrot the lies of apartheid and genocide and the progressively more absurd claims of Israeli atrocities. Learn the objective facts. Use your intelligence. Open your eyes and see the true agenda of the people you are supporting. Do they promote cooperation, compromise, coexistence?

1ciqilk,l2dh37h,kalimba218,"Yes, because using an inverted red triangle (explicit symbol of supporting Hamas) instead isn‚Äôt genocidal or violent at all üòê

‚ÄúThe symbol first appeared in propaganda videos promoted by the al-Qassam brigades, the military wing of Hamas, which showed footage of Hamas terrorists attacking Israeli military targets. In these videos, Hamas would point out the target using the inverted red triangle. Though it can be used innocuously in general pro-Palestine social media posts, the inverted red triangle is now used to represent Hamas itself and glorify its use of violence in many popular anti-Zionist memes and political cartoons. For example, individuals will place the symbol over an image of Israeli soldiers or overlaid on a Star of David as a way to call for further violent resistance.‚Äù

Often you'll see on people's bios or social media the inverted red triangle to represent support for Hamas and violent resistance that targets Israeli civilians. Like let's just be real about it.
Even Al-Jazeera reports it as a symbol supporting ""resistance fighters"", aka Hamas, although Al-Jazeera does pretty openly support Hamas so it's viewed positively in their eyes.

If they just want an end to the occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, great, I support that, but it should be noted that the reason Israel is so restrictive is because Palestinians kept deliberately targeting Israeli civilians with suicide bombings, shootings, stabbing, and rockets and that just ending the occupation won‚Äôt end the violence unless Palestinians accept Israel and decide to stop waging war.

It is also excluding non-Jews from that national self-determination. A representative democracy that claims to be equal yet seeks to maintain a majority Jewish population, don't you see the irony in that? Israel is supposed to be this bastion of liberal democracy in the Middle East, so what Arab country are you comparing the self-determination clause to, Saudi Arabia?

""Special status"" doesn't mean protected. It means special. The same way Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan have a ""special administrative status"" in relation to China. The end result is that the intentionally Jewish majority, by law, can regulate the use of Arabic.

&gt;‚ÄúJewish settlement‚Äù is distinct from the illegal ‚ÄúIsraeli settlements‚Äù in the West Bank, if you click the link in the Wikipedia article you shared

I was under the impression it's an umbrella term. Israeli settlements in the west bank are, after all, a type of Jewish settlement. The Nation-State bill makes no distinction, and Israel's [actions](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-approves-new-parcel-west-bank-land-settlement-2024-03-22/) certainly show that they want to promote settlement in occupied territories. [This page from Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2019/01/chapter-3-israeli-settlements-and-international-law/) summarizes, referencing policies about urban planning, road use, etc",1,1714574850.0,t1_l23ek6h
1cfhd44,l23xx80,Empyrion132,"""National self-determination"" means the right for a group of people with a collective identity (a ""nation"", like Jews or Kurds) to form a state (a territorial government) where they, as a nation, can govern themselves through the state, in contrast to being governed by a different national group. 

An example of this is [the Latvian constitution](https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/57980): ""The State of Latvia... has been established by uniting historical Latvian lands and on the basis of the unwavering will of the Latvian nation to have its own State and its inalienable right of self-determination in order to guarantee the existence and development of the Latvian nation, its language and culture throughout the centuries, to ensure freedom and promote welfare of the people of Latvia and each individual."" Latvia was ruled by a series of foreign empires for hundreds of years before achieving independence after WWI. Latvia is also about 24% ethnic Russian.

Granting national self-determination to other nations within a state would mean that those nations have the right to secede and form their own states. Latvia does not grant ethnic Russians the right to secede and form Russia Jr. Similarly, Israel does not grant Israeli Arabs the right to secede and form a separate state.

France is also a representative democracy with equal rights that is 86% ethnic French and seeks to maintain a majority French population, if its immigration laws are anything to go by. Its [constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/France_2008) says ""The French people solemnly proclaim their attachment to the Rights of Man and the principles of national sovereignty,"" and ""France shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic."" It's not granting national sovereignty to the minority ethnic Italian population. 

The Nation State law literally says ""This clause does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect."" It technically removes Arabic as an official state language, but doesn't allow for any effective demotion. 

After doing some more research you might be right that the ""settlement"" term is broadly construed and often applies to the illegal settlements in the West Bank. 

I personally wouldn't have made Arabic a ""special"" language or supported settlements, and I think the Druze brought up valid complaints about wanting to be included in a national identity of Israeli, not excluded for not being Jewish. None of this makes Israel either an apartheid or an ethnostate, however, at least any more than other countries with a majority ethnic group and language.",1,1714579272.0,t1_l23l6b7
1cfhd44,l24b52k,--A3--,"""Jewish"" is a religion and an ethnicity. When Israel is founded for the purpose of being a Jewish nation, and the Nation-State bill defines national self-determination as something unique to the *Jewish people*, Israel is by definition a Jewish ethnostate.

The Latvian constitution does not say that self-determination is the unique right of ethnic Latvians. Ethnic Russians who live in Latvia are still ""The people of Latvia and each individual,"" nobody seems to be excluded.

I'm not familiar with other politics of Latvia, but I do know France has its own xenophobia problems. Anti-immigration is generally a goal of white nationalism and white ethnocentrism, and there is definitely a contingent who say ""France is for The French"" e.g. Marine Le Pen, who believes multiculturalism has failed and that France should [ban ritual slaughter](https://apnews.com/article/sports-france-europe-paris-marine-le-pen-d77606f09df17415b94c273eb71be489) and [public displays of religious clothing](https://www.jta.org/2016/10/18/global/le-pen-says-as-french-president-she-would-ban-all-religious-symbols-including-kippot), functionally banning kosher/halal diets and headscarves/kippahs.

On the other hand, the U.S. sends $10 Billion dollars per year to Israel. It doesn't matter if they are military credits. Why do we send that money to a first world country that can seemingly defend itself year after year? Especially now, when it would be far more help in Ukraine.

1) The nature of Gaza ‚Äî bombings of hospitals, executions of bound prisoners, denying food aid, killing journalists ‚Äî these are all incredibly incendiary acts, the fact that they provoke outcry makes complete sense. 
2) The recency of Gaza ‚Äî as you said, one crisis has been going since 2013, the other since 2023. Do you expect people to be protesting for Palestine in a decade? 
3) There‚Äôs far less reporting out of Xinjiang. Regardless of why this is the case (suppression) I‚Äôm sure you would agree that fewer reporters means less international exposure, which is necessary to generate momentum for protests. 
4) International outcry. The majority of UN nations are in favor of a ceasefire, this cannot be said about Uighurs. Of course that would indicate that people are more likely to protest.

UC uses OUR money to fund g3nocid3 and everyone here doesn‚Äôt even seem to care about that? Okay someone lit a car on fire which is obviously not good but where is the same energy and anger for the students who have paid tuition and were brutalized by police? If UCSC did it to them it could very well happen to you if you protested or speak out about anything you feel is wrong with the school. Also consider the fact that none of our loop buses are fully functional or safe?! or the fact that housing is a nightmare here? or the fact that TAs have never been paid enough? UCSC has so many problems it doesn‚Äôt seem to start with these protestors‚Ä¶ 

Seems like these comments are just showing peoples true colors. Clearly people don‚Äôt care to protest or understand the meaning of it. Protesting is to cause a disturbance/bring attention to a pressing issue and none of them were violent until pd was called on students BY OUR OWN CHANCELLOR AND VP. I know we‚Äôve all seen the pictures of her walking her dog and smiling as students get arrested‚Ä¶.

This anger you see from protestor‚Äôs is not only anger at the g3nocid3 but it‚Äôs also pent up anger from all the racist incidents ucsc never addresses, violent, dangerous incidents that UCSC has put students, teachers, and bus drivers in. Don‚Äôt forget a bus driver literally D1ED because UCSC refuses to get new loop buses and spend money on students. instead they spend it on funding a g3nocid3‚Ä¶

UCSC has historically been a UC that is outspoken if you go here and are mad or surprised at the protests i‚Äôd encourage you to do further research about the schools you‚Äôre apply to next time you do apply cause it‚Äôs just a given it‚Äôs bound to happen at this UC with in the four years you spend here. 

The problem is clearly not protesting it‚Äôs the UC system perpetuating a cycle of constant issues by choosing to ignore the root causes (money hungry individuals that are in power) and refusing to use student money on students to keep them safe and protected‚Ä¶.

And for all the people that are calling this an act of antisemitism I think you should consider not being such a sheeple. The government has time and time again weaponized religion against people of color and minorities. At first it was Christianity  against Judaism/AA/Asians/Latinos/POC and now it‚Äôs Christianity/Judaism against AA/Asians/Latinos/Palestinians/other Poc. Judaism as a religion is not inherently Zionist but the people who practice it have fallen into the trap of America and Israel  making them believe they are better than other people (Palestinians) because they are closer to whiteness. The only time America will accept you is if you are close to whiteness and accept capitalism (bc you benefit from it to an extent but you‚Äôre still a cog in the machine). Not all Jewish ppl are Zionist and not all Zionist are Jewish. But if you are Jewish and a Zionist think about why you feel that way and who has brainwashed you and fed you lies and information that keeps you complacent and encourages you to have mindsets that reinforce white supremacy.",-5,1717425967.0,t3_1d6mszx

1gg03gl,lum2ghg,violetferret04,"as an abled person who's noticed this as well, just a couple of notes for other abled people:

\- if there are free seats further down the bus, take those first, even if you have to sit next to someone (ooh so scary, i know). the entirety of the bus seats should be full before you consider taking the disabled/elderly designated seats as an abled person.  
i've seen so many people walk straight on to a near-empty bus and take the ADA seats because they want to sit with their group of 3+ friends -- if that's you, you're being childish, just move to other seats man. i promise you'll survive a 20 min bus ride

\- IF the entire bus is full and you sat down in the ADA seats, and you either 1) see a visibly disabled person board the bus, or 2) are asked by a disabled person if they can sit, YOU SHOULD MOVE. everyone will inherently think that someone else will move, ending up with nobody giving up their seat (and blankly staring, like OP mentioned). for psych nerds, remember the bystander effect -- if you don't act, others won't either

edit: also not everyone has visible disabilities or mobility aids but still need the disabled seats! it is not your job to screen people if they're actually disabled! just give up the seat if someone asks",82,1730332235.0,t3_1gg03gl

If you‚Äôre having difficulty with getting that reserved seating, let the bus driver know. It‚Äôs part of their job training to make seating for you.

1gg03gl,lum58fw,FoiledFeline,"This sucks and I'm sorry you have to deal with it. You probably have to just directly ask a specific person for their seat. Don't say generally ""hey I need someone to give me their seat"" or expect someone to notice your mobility aids and proactively give you their seat. It would be wonderful if that worked, but unfortunately it doesn't. You sometimes need to make someone a little uncomfortable and have a little bit of confrontation to get what you need, and that's ok. Make sure to sincerely thank the person when they stand up for you. Try to ask someone who isn't wearing headphones or talking to someone else, but don't be afraid to gently tap someone's shoulder to get their attention if no one is an ""easy target"". I kinda tune out everyone else on busses because I find them to be sensorily a little overwhelming (loud, smelly, hot), so I probably wouldn't notice that someone needed a seat unless they directly asked. But if you directly asked me I'd definitely give you my seat. If directly asking a few different people doesn't work or you get a hostile response from anyone, I'd turn around and tell the bus driver that you're disabled, need a seat, and having trouble getting someone to cooperate to give you a seat and ask if they could help you.

1994: Israeli extremists bomb palestinian civillians. Hamas retaliates with suicide bombers, causing Israel to back out of the two state solution negotiations. Israeli extremists assasinate peaceful palestinian leaders, further slowing progress.

""In 1994, during the overlap of the Jewish festival of Purim and the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Jewish extremist Baruch Goldstein opened fire on Muslim worshippers in the Sanctuary of Abraham above the Cave of Machpelah (also called the Tomb of the Patriarchs) in Hebron, a holy site frequented by both Jews and Muslims. The same year, Hamas, a militant Palestinian organization that likewise rejected a two-state solution, began a campaign of suicide bombings. On November 4, 1995, Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist while attending a peace rally""

2008: Hamas wins election by popular vote, Israel backs out of solution immediately despite Hamas asking for peace.

""Although some leaders of Hamas now indicated a willingness to accept a two-state solution, as well as the bilateral agreements between Israel and the PA, Israel was unwilling to negotiate with a Hamas-led government.""

2014: Palestine initially refuses to negotiate after Israel builds settlements on Palestinian terrirory, but eventually accepts. Israel ends talks shortly after because they change their policy. During this few-week time period both sides cannot come to an agreement. Leaked documents suggest this is not the fault of one side or the other specifically.

""Netanyahu implemented a freeze on settlements in the West Bank from November 2009 to September 2010. Because a freeze was not implemented for Jewish neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem, which Netanyahu insisted were not settlements, Abbas refused to meet until the last few weeks of the freeze. When the freeze ended, negotiations ceased. Direct talks did not occur again until Livni was appointed to resume the task in 2013‚Äì14. The talks fell apart after relations continued to falter and negotiators failed to make significant progress within the set timetable.""",20,1714877175.0,t1_l2mvouw

Of course some people in this thread have attempted to say the same thing I said, but in a much more mean way.

Instead of assuming that anyone who says the phrase is genocidal - which is not true - maybe try to see who is saying it and where they are coming from. Remember, its just like how you don't agree with the Likud party. One faction doesn't represent everyone's views.

1ckargl,l35lg83,[deleted],"I think you read me wrong. I don't think protests were harmful to the civil rights movement (and never stated so). In fact, protests were very much needed. Likewise, student protests have been necessary for changing university rules concerning segregation (not that those are perfect now). 


This is just one man's opinion, but... location, location, location. 


If you want a change, and you want to protest, you should protest where the change-makers are. No one on any university campus has the power to change the Israel-Palestine conflict. Now if they were protesting administrative policies of the university, sure, protest away on campus, but they're protesting the administrative policies of D.C., and they're doing it on an unrelated campus. 


Again, just my opinion, but a university is pretty clearly an ineffective location for a war protest when the war isn't about something university has control over. At that point, I start seeing protestors as less ""trying to enact change"" and more ""happy to follow the crowd into pepper spray.""


As for the protest itself, I agree with Friedman's NY times article from today: 


""First, they (the protests) are virtually all about stopping Israel‚Äôs shameful behavior in killing so many Palestinian civilians in its pursuit of Hamas fighters, while giving a free pass to Hamas‚Äôs shameful breaking of the cease-fire that existed on Oct. 7. On that morning, Hamas launched an invasion in which it murdered Israeli parents in front of their children, children in front of their parents ‚Äî documenting it on GoPro cameras ‚Äî raped Israeli women and kidnapped or killed everyone they could get their hands on, from little kids to sick grandparents.


Again, you can be ‚Äî and should be ‚Äî appalled at Israel‚Äôs response: bombing everything in its path in Gaza so disproportionately that thousands of children have been killed, maimed and orphaned. 


But if you refuse to acknowledge what Hamas did to trigger this ‚Äî not to justify what Israel has done, but to explain how the Jewish state could inflict so much suffering on Palestinian men, women and children in reverse ‚Äî you‚Äôre just another partisan throwing another partisan log on the fire.


By giving Hamas a pass, the protests have put the onus on Israel to such a degree that its very existence is a target for some students, while Hamas‚Äôs murderous behavior is passed off as a praiseworthy adventure in decolonization.""

I'm surprised how much good it's actually doing. I stand corrected!

&gt;DOHA/TEL AVIV, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday rejected Hamas' latest offer for a ceasefire and return of hostages held in the Gaza Strip, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was still room for negotiation toward an agreement.


&gt;Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza, proposed a ceasefire of 4-1/2 months, during which all hostages would go free, Israel would withdraw its troops from Gaza and an agreement would be reached on an end to the war.


https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-mediators-search-final-formula-israel-hamas-ceasefire-2024-02-07/


He's had plenty of opportunities to release some or all of the hostages and has refused each time. From November:


&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a deal for a five-day ceasefire with Palestinian militant groups in Gaza in return for the release of some of the hostages held in the territory early in the war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.


&gt;The sources said the Israeli prime minister rejected the deal outright in negotiations soon after Hamas militants staged an unprecedented incursion into Israeli territory on 7 October, killing an estimated 1,400 people.


*rejected outright*, goddamn that's nasty work.


&gt;According to three sources familiar with the talks, the original deal on the table involved freeing children, women and elderly and sick people in exchange for a five-day ceasefire, but the Israeli government turned this down and demonstrated its rejection with the launch of the ground offensive.

It was bulldozed during summer break under huge amounts of controversy. I consider it a huge act of vandalism on the part of the school, but they were concerned with the ""hippie"" image of the school and wanted to ""become the college of Silicon Valley.""

Elfland occupied most of the space between Merrill and the science buildings, thousands of art pieces, incredible ""trip"" spaces, incredible talent involved for decades. All gone in a few days of clandestine bulldozers.

For more context, this was one year before ""mandatory grades"" were initiated instead of the narrative evaluation system. We lost a lot when UCSC sold out.

They demanded that UC Santa Cruz divest from and boycott companies affiliated with Israel, a demand that the¬†[UC Office of the President has already addressed and deemed unacceptable](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-divestment). Most worryingly, they demanded that we curtail the foundational right of academic freedom by condemning the use of funding from select federal agencies. Functionally, the encampment wanted to prevent our researchers from pursuing research related to topics with which they disagree. This is a dangerous precedent and to give in to it would undermine academic freedom and make our academic community vulnerable to the values of whatever political force seeks to prevent free inquiry.""

Seems like the cops aren‚Äôt doing anything which is probably helping fuel resentment. the cops should be arresting people and breaking it up ( or at least I would expect them to). Seems intentional to draw up more criticism of the protest since now innocent bystanders are being affected. I remember almost 10 years ago a bunch of people blocked highway 1 in protest of a bunch of stuff (too many messages wasn‚Äôt a good look for them at the time), they stopped traffic for a few hours before ultimately being arrested and expelled. 

Im pretty sure the cops COULD arrest and break up these protests if they wanted to, but it probably helps the cops to keep em going since then it looks like the protesters are making things worse by just doing what they are doing.

No agreement was broken, except on the UC's side. This is a clear example of the law failing the workers and unions and giving even more power to those who already have it.

The power of a union comes from their ability to collectively strike, not the legality of it.

American laws are not the end all and be all, and your historical ignorance of that fact is showing.

You look absolutely ridiculous.

2.) I show a historical example of unions working outside the law to accomplish their goal, the same goal you based your entire initial condescending argument on believe it or not, and you ignore it completely. Typical.

3.) Believe it or not, workers do not have to tell their employers that they belong to a union. Workers can also form unions within a company so they hold power over that company. Companies looking for hires should *not* know if a worker belongs to a union, that only negates the power of that union. 

If your employer knows that you're in *any* union they will just hire someone else if they can. It's easier that way for them. And if they can't hire someone else, then it doesn't really matter if your union has any ties to organizations at all now does it?

Ultimately, organizations serve only as an employer for union members who willingly admit they belong to a union. By entering into an agreement to specifically sign a contract with such an employer/organization, unions therefore hurt their own power to strike--it's completely expected and can be overriden by their employer even if the grounds to strike are legal. This can be seen in UAW's case, where their contract forced them to end their strike despite it being found legal in multiple courts. This is a clear example of the law failing UAW despite their ""legal"" protest.

Your view on unions is so surface level it's astonishing. The smallest amount of in depth analysis reveals that your entire view on unions is makes no logical sense. You're so condescending yet so completely unknowledgeable about the actual events that caused UAW to strike in the first place.",-3,1717866588.0,t1_l7ox1fv

1daokgw,l7pu82p,bautdean,"1) People at the encampment were given numerous warnings to disperse as the encampment had been declared illegal. If I recall, they started telling people to leave around 3pm and the raid didn‚Äôt start until 3am. That‚Äôs roughly 12 hours for them to say ‚Äúoh shit gotta go‚Äù. I‚Äôll have to check the videos I have as it‚Äôs been a while. 
  
People with clearly pro-Palestinian attire and keffiyehs tried breaking into the SAC by pulling in doors, trying to sneak in when someone authorized was entering, and rushing in. I know a few students were kicked out when they tried to get onto the roof when it was clearly marked as ‚ÄúDo Not Enter‚Äù. People were also found to have been trying to take over a building. 
  
There is a student code of conduct that needs to be followed and those were clearly violated. There are also CBAs, disciplinary measures, grievances, etc laid out in the contract. 
  
Students fought back with umbrellas, fire extinguishers, and other objects. The UCLA SJP telegram group gave out messages on fighting, defense classes, and how to fight the police. 
  
With any mob, they‚Äôre going to clear them out. They were prepared to fight. Again, I‚Äôll have to look at MY videos starting from 3pm when police starting showing up at Wilson Plaza - 5am when the raid was about finished. 
   
Last time I checked, the people at the encampment went there at their own time, while not working. Why should my union protect me if I decide to barricade the buildings I have access to just to make a point? I‚Äôll get arrested, charged, and face disciplinary action for what I did.

2) Precedents have been set about unions and the union I am currently in will be fighting an uphill battle due to this strike. It took them 2 years to TA and amend the current contract to get what we wanted. Bargaining is about to begin for a new contract and this just places a whole load of shit on the bargaining team. Who‚Äôs to say UC won‚Äôt call this out and won‚Äôt make concessions because of this? I know how some of the bargaining team at the UC works seeing as I‚Äôve been to every single meeting we‚Äôve had with them and how they like to say ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre following the contract and that‚Äôs what it says in the contract. Why should the UC change what it says?‚Äù
  
3) We are talking about the unions at the UCs. Other unions have different rules. When you apply for a job at a UC, most of the listings clearly state what union you are in such as TX, BX, CX, etc. If you are not in a union, it will say Policy 99. 
  
When I joined, it clearly said that the role was union, the manager said union, HR said union. The union has clearly made progress with all the campuses as a vote was recently ratified by the members. 
  
Also, what are you talking about? The strike was NEVER found legal by PERB. They declined the injunction and said that the UC did not meet the really high bar of serious business harm. In fact, PERB gave UAW 4811 a complaint for the strike since they didn‚Äôt try to bargain with the UC in good faith. Not long after, PERB gave the UC a complaint too.",4,1717875724.0,t1_l7p6hc7

1daokgw,l7pi2ag,Ill_Radish6965,"Here is a response from the university of Michigan to UCSC: 

Dear Members of UAW 4811, 

We, the members of the Graduate Employees‚Äô Organization at University of Michigan, write to you to salute you in leveraging your labor power toward justice from California to Palestine. The University of California, like the University of Michigan, funds the apartheid system and genocide in Palestine, and we support your strike action for divestment in line with the Palestinian BDS call. At a time when universities and other institutions rely on the state to repress pro-Palestine activism and distract from the massacres unfolding in Gaza, we see that the UC has made attempts to secure an injunction, and now secured a TRO, as yet another tool to repress the struggle for divestment and amnesty. We write to you as trade unionists who have navigated the terrain of injunctions and TROs in the hope that our experiences can be instructive. 

Graduate workers at Michigan have gone on strike twice in the past four years, and both times, the University filed requests for injunctions. In 2020, we ended our strike immediately after the University filed an injunction due to a lack of preparation and fear-mongering within our union that prevented a grounded understanding of the process and risk involved. This premature conclusion had implications not just for us, but for the local labor movement; empowered with the knowledge that the threat of an injunction alone could break a strike, UM continued to employ this tactic against other labor unions.

In 2023, we did not back down so quickly. Even facing the threat of another injunction, we knew that our power came from our commitment to fighting for each other. Collective conversations about the risks ‚Äì on the one hand, legal fines and potential arrest of union officers, and on the other hand, the cost of not winning our demands if we were to end our strike prematurely ‚Äì kept us grounded. After UM filed for an injunction, we prepared to hold department meetings and vote to continue striking in the event the injunction was granted. Ultimately, a judge denied UM‚Äôs injunction, and we wielded our strike power to win serious contract gains. From West Virginia to Newton to the University of Michigan, education workers in the U.S. have shown that we can strike in violation of the law and win. 

UC wants you to think that you cannot possibly win. That is why they have filed their requests for injunction and now a TRO; not because they sincerely believe their legal arguments but because they want to zap your fighting spirit and break your political will. They want you to think you have no space to maneuver, that our struggles are not connected and the costs of standing up for yourselves and the Palestinian cause are simply too high, and that real power lies in the hands of lawyers and judges, instead of your own. Only you can determine what is actually true ‚Äì what power do you have and are you willing to exert it towards divestment? 

Your decision to take strike action in pursuit of divestment and in solidarity with Palestinian workers is a testament to the possibility of building a global labor movement in the U.S. that does not stop fighting when anti-labor laws are mobilized to serve American imperial interests, but instead dares to pursue justice for all, across geographies. As Palestinian workers lead the way for all of us, you are laying a path for a global material solidarity in line with their call. We know that victory in this strike means a victory for the Palestinian liberation movement, and for all of us. Strike to win!

In Solidarity,

‚ÄúThe octets were the most radical of the three types [of apartments offered in Kresge], featuring a split-level plan with bathrooms located downstairs and a sleeping-living area upstairs. These units were intentionally left almost completely open, with limited opportunities for conventional ideas of privacy and only a bank of downstairs lockers for securing personal belongings. Students were given the unusual opportunity of partitioning the space themselves with curtains, furniture, and other design interventions. Only a couple of years after their completion, the university transformed the octets into sextets as the repercussions of such cohabitation became evident.‚Äù¬†¬†

It is not true that ‚Äúmost‚Äù people have ‚Äúgenital‚Äù herpes. HSV1 commonly causes cold sores (50-80% Americans) and HSV2 commonly causes genital herpes (Only 1 out of 6 Americans). HSV1 can also cause genital herpes, but it is still more commonly caused by HSV2. 

There is vast difference in management depending on clinical presentation (cold sores vs genital).  So, yes, the OP has the responsibility to tell whoever he/she will be intimate with if he/she already knows he/she has genital herpes.

https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/herpes-hsv1-and-hsv2

I want to emphasize that it is not the end of the world to have genital herpes, but disclosure and transparency is very important since it is still a lifetime of clinical management/ treatment. 

The symptoms can ‚Äúclear‚Äù but the virus will remain latent in your body, meaning there is no cure for it, but outbreaks and symptoms can be managed, especially with current treatments. People with genital herpes can still have perfectly normal lives.

1dopvls,lacc5vq,SantaCruzKush,"You‚Äôre a mod?

The statement ""most people have herpes"" is not accurate when broken down by specific types of herpes infections. 

Let's address this line by line:

1. ""An estimated 491.5 million people were living with HSV-2 infection in 2016...""
   - This translates to about 6.6% of the global population, given that the world population in 2016 was approximately 7.5 billion.

2. ""An estimated 3.7 billion people had HSV-1 infection during the same year...""
   - This means about 49.3% of the global population had HSV-1.

3. ""World population in 2016 was about 7.5 billion. So saying 'most people have herpes' would have been accurate in 2016 and it probably is accurate today if herpes rates haven't gone down.""
   - While HSV-1 is highly prevalent, combining both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections still does not mean that most people have genital herpes (HSV-2), which is what is typically of concern in discussions about disclosure to sexual partners.

Given these points, it is correct that HSV-1 is widespread and that a significant portion of the global population has some form of herpes. However, for HSV-2, which is the primary concern for genital herpes, the majority of people do not have this infection.

HSV2 still predominantly causes genital herpes and HSV1 type genital herpes is increasing, however, more recent studies have also shown that HSV1-type genital herpes has reduced recurrence and viral shedding than HSV2-type genital herpes, so management/treatment between the two can also differ (example CDC recommendation: suppressive therapy for HSV2 type genital herpes for both frequent and less frequent recurrences vs suppressive therapy only for HSV1 type genital herpes with frequent recurrences).

HSV1, which more commonly causes cold sores and which most people have or have had is more common and does not need clinical management compared to HSV2, which more commonly causes genital herpes (only 1 out of 6 Americans). HSV1 can also cause genital herpes, but HSV2 is still the usual cause of genital herpes. 

There is significant difference in clinical management between cold sores and genital herpes. So, the OP has the responsibility to disclose the infection to anyone he/she would be intimate with.

History Lesson:

The Waffen-SS unit known as the Arab Legion was founded by Palestinians in 1941/42.

They were later joined by Lebanese, Iraqi, Iranian, Syrian, Saudi, Egyptian, and other Arabs.

These same Arabs went home after the Second World War. They joined their national armies or various subunits in the case of the Palestinians. And then intended to drive Jews out of the region a second time in 2,000 years.

Unfortunately for the Arabs, the Israelis won.

And because they had so many known Nazis among their Military and Government bodies, France and Britain helped the Israelis initially. Since they were killing Nazis and doing the world a service. It was very Patriotic for their citizens. 

Of course, France eventually wanted good ties with their former colonies, and the British were struggling with financial troubles.

Eisenhower putting his foot down on the issue of the Suez Canal was a convenient means of getting out of dodge for them.

Then, the USA backed Israel out of need to allow the West to maintain an outpost in the Middle East that could and has been trusted to stay with the West.

Having been purged, the remaining Arab Nazis got together and founded the PLO, and eventually, the diehard remnants and descendants formed Hamas.

Now Hamas gets supplies and resources from Iran and Russia. The former also included Arab Nazis when the Islamic Revolution ousted the Shah, and they would go on to found the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.

As for Russia... Where else do you think Hamas got stockpiles of legit Strumgewher 44 Assault Rifles?

When KGB Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Putin fled East Germany, he took trucks loaded with Stazi resources and East German Military Resources, which included StG 44 Assault Rifles.",6,1716887652.0,t3_1d28j0n

I don't have the specific dimensions, but u/1sunday 's post below has a picture of the wardrobe open, and that can give you an idea of how much space you are going to get. I suggest folding your clothing since it will offer much more versatility with the space, but if you need to hang shirts and stuff, just note that there won't be all too much space if you get the clothes hamper I suggested. 

  
Hope that helps!

1gse5ct,lxi4t37,OppositeHyena7070,"So, I'm first really sorry you're going through this. I think you are very brave and strong to even seek help here. So please know that. 

I can almost guarantee you that you are not alone, not trying to invalidate how you're feeling, more or less trying to comfort you in the sense that you are not alone, and there is nothing wrong with you. I'm no therapist but I've been to MANY sessions at my past CC. Which truly helped me work through a lot of my pain, hurt, anger, trauma, and things that were really hindering my growth personally and academically. I can assure you that by HIPPA laws your parents would not get notice of you seeing a therapist through CAPS. That's law mandated. The only thing they mention to you when you start a session is that if you tell them you are hurting yourself or want to do so they have to by law seek out other medical teams to better support you. But by law they can't tell your parents or send them anything if you see CAPS. I'm not sure about outside therapy though, if you use your insurance then yes, they might see it come up on a statement. Also, not sure how old you are or your situation but look into state insurance (medical). It's flipping time consuming but if you are wanting to branch off from the toxic/unhealthy family dynamic start looking into that. I wish I could help more with that but I don't want to overstep or make you uncomfortable. 

  
All I can say is maybe journal, I know writing for me personally even if it's a 3 sentence entry, does help. In time you can also use your journaling as a positive reflection or tool to see how far you've really come. Knowing that you had past struggles you overcame and seeing where you're at now kind of lifts things up. You're at a UNI. Not many people can say that, I hope you know how much of an accomplishment that is in itself. 

  
I'm not always on so my responses might be lagging but I'm more than happy to share what I know if you have any follow up questions. :)

  
Also, talk to your professors about this. I know when I went through similar periods I communicated with my professors and one of them was actually the one who guided me to therapy. School therapy. So, just know they are there to help. Don't give up. If they say they're busy explain to them you need this as you are not in a good mental space and your mental health is a priority. I hope all goes well. Reach out if you want to chat more, I felt this in my bones and I know the feeling. Sending you warm hugs and strength friend.",2,1731796210.0,t1_lxgh4yh

But, I‚Äôm super lucky to have a support network, even though my brain convinced me at the time I didn‚Äôt.
Even if you don‚Äôt think you do, there are people watching out for you!

Have you tried therapy? It‚Äôs not for everyone, and it‚Äôs not the be all end all cure, but it definitely could help you get out of the mindset that you are disconnected.

I think the main thing is, you don‚Äôt have to force yourself to feel better, it absolutely sucks but it usually stems from something we aren‚Äôt addressing. I see you like to take walks so maybe walk around one of those trails tomorrow and make a voice memo of what you‚Äôre feeling and put effort into understanding why you feel this way. Or if you want to walk with someone, specifically a very poor conversationalist, I‚Äôm down :D 
What helped me most of all was to first chat with some people about what I was feeling and then sing my heart out in the forest, which I am 100% sure other hikers heard, but who cares. If I was ready to disappear, why would I care what other people thought about my Frank Sinatra impression.

But regardless, you are absolutely noticed, you‚Äôre not a blank space, and I, at least, think you‚Äôre a great person. I do hope you keep going :)",11,1731742148.0,t3_1gse5ct

I was sick for a few days earlier this quarter as well as last year and no one commented when I was better and returned to classes and activities. Even people I talked with every time in a section or club meeting didn't say anything about missing me or how they were glad I was feeling better although I would always notice them missing and comment when they were back in attendance. My family is pretty critical of me and told me I have no reason to be unhappy the one time I said I was a few years ago.,3,1731776700.0,t1_lxefzlm

- I think your family was quite rude to invalidate your feelings like that &gt;:( but if you‚Äôre feeling like this, then clearly there‚Äôs a reason to be upset. Nothing your family thinks will change that.
- I think people tend to ignore classmates unless you hang out outside of class and help them with classwork. I live right next to my classmate. A foot away, we have no talked for more than a combined 3 minutes. The man was literally bleeding and moaning in pain (had a crash on asphalt), and I was the only one who asked if he was okay and if I could help in a crowded area?
- Which I think is the final thing here, I‚Äôm from a small town in SoCal and I‚Äôm constantly told that the normal things back home, are way too nice and seen as something saint-like here. Like saying hello to everyone you see, making care packages, checking in on people, giving them food just because? It‚Äôs an interesting culture shock even though I‚Äôm only 7 hours away. There are of course people who are different, shoutout to the people working at the Porter/Kresge dining hall who give compliments as freely as they give food. But, I‚Äôve noticed a general trend of people here acting a little more stand off-ish in the socially polite zone.

I guess, I don't remember anyone specifically caring about me. One of my strongest memories is throwing up in elementary school and my parent being called to take me home.

As much as I've found students don't wanna talk about it (white guilt or wtvr other reason), I think the school's white/white-passing majority just means that people dont know how to act around BIPOC.",3,1734260615.0,t3_1hdu91d
1hdu91d,m335d9b,Puzzleheaded-Lie1634,What‚Äôs white guilt?,1,1734752988.0,t1_m25ioo1
1hdu91d,m38a2mm,jinmy50,"assuming you‚Äôre genuinely asking, it‚Äôs a belief where white people feel they bear the responsibility for the harm that‚Äôs been done against POC throughout history just because they are also white. awareness of your own privilege as a white person and acknowledgement of how racism is still imbedded in our structures is a good thing. White guilt however, can can cause some to distance themselves from POC, feeling overcome with the guilt of their ancestors actions. it does nothing to help but instead worsens the problem.

For some, white guilt also causes them to distance themselves from their white identity. This means people refuse to acknowledge their privilege or may think of themselves as ‚Äúone of the good ones‚Äù. 

This can also lead to what‚Äôre known as ‚Äúwhite saviors‚Äù, who believe that they are champions for POC struggles. This continues to take POC voices out of the spotlight.

All of these examples exist around UCSC in my opinion",1,1734834928.0,t1_m335d9b
1hdu91d,m26wfzc,SilverUnicorn44,"I lived there two years as a transfer student and during that time heard some of the most racist comments many from my landlord who was Korean and spent his whole life in the area, he would say the most dehumanizing things about people and it made it very difficult to be civil. I would ask certain locals about it that had grown up there and they said it‚Äôs always been that way but ‚Äúyou get used to it or just ignore those people‚Äù. On multiple occasions I ripped ss stickers off of crossing posts and various other public spots. The racism is one of the main reasons why I was so disgusted with the idea of staying there permanently when people asked if I would want to stay after graduation.",2,1734282373.0,t3_1hdu91d
1hdu91d,m24m0ei,Sharpes_Sword,"I was a student recently and dealt with a lot of racism here, purposeful and accidental. 

Some people were just full racist, like that was their normal routine even if I was there.

Some people just hadn't interacted with Black people too much and it showed. They talked about Black people more as ideas than people.

Some people just wanted to stay within their culture and didn't seem to want me interacting with their friend group (happened a few times in the case of hanging out with a mutual friend and another group).

Honestly, in everywhere I've lived, I feel like UCSC had the most racist stuff going on, though I feel like in part that is because most people here are young adults who are open about talking about stuff vs suburbs/cities where people keep to themselves. I'm sure if other places were as open about their social/political views it would be worse.",3,1734239971.0,t3_1hdu91d

1dcualz,l81r274,quarrelreef,"Isn‚Äôt israel holding several thousands of palestinians as political prisoners, many without any charges? Many of them children under the age of 18? Wasn‚Äôt that the reason hostages were taken on Oct. 7th, when in the past one Israeli hostage has been exchanged for dozens of Palestinian prisoners? Haven‚Äôt israeli news sources been proven to, and even admitted to have published unverified and false reports of ‚Äúbeheaded babies‚Äù in order to justify their aggressive response? Haven‚Äôt numerous reports shown that many lives lost on Oct. 7th were from reckless firing by IDF helicopters? Haven‚Äôt several freed captives described a scorched earth response from the IDF in which their fellow hostages were blown to pieces along with militant targets by the forces supposed to save them? Haven‚Äôt hundreds of civilian casualties, including children, been repeatedly deemed collateral in bombings to target numbers of Hamas operatives in the single digits? Isn‚Äôt israel indiscriminately flattening hospitals, universities, and refugee camps in Gaza? Aren‚Äôt they also increasing illegal expansion and settlement efforts into the West Bank, a region not under Hamas control, resulting in numerous civilian casualties?

I‚Äôm not trying to devalue one human life in comparison to another by posing these questions in retort to yours. I‚Äôm trying to illustrate with the same line of questioning as you that the Israeli government is inflicting, and has always inflicted, violence several orders of magnitude greater than has been inflicted on them. If you justify the violence used by Israel because it is in response to the violence used by Hamas, then shouldn‚Äôt that violence itself be responded to with an even greater violence? Shouldn‚Äôt Hamas have been justified in their violence because of the violence and repression inflicted on the Palestinian people since the inception of the Israeli state?

I‚Äôm not trying to argue that justification because I don‚Äôt believe in endless cycles of humans crushing each other and erasing countless innocent families from existence because it was done to them before. I‚Äôm trying to say that if you ARE arguing that force justifies force, then the force is far greater and more destructive coming from the Israeli side, so why wouldn‚Äôt that beget force such as hostage taking and rocket firing (at the world‚Äôs most advanced rocket defense system) in response? 

I don‚Äôt believe that violence and war is the solution to achieve peace between differing peoples. The quandry here is that without responding forcefully to violence, you risk being wiped out along with your families, and never living to see that peace occur. But violence with no end is cruel and in many ways turns your struggle, in the eyes of your enemy, into the exact thing you are trying to avoid for yourself and your family. 

Israel has refused several ceasefire requests from Hamas in exchange for releasing hostages. If ‚Äúall they cared about,‚Äù as they often claim, is the release of the hostages, why would they refuse numerous offers to return them? Why would they result to artillery tactics against buildings they know have hostages in them? A dead hostage benefits Israel more than a living one. A living hostage can show the world that negotiations ARE possible. A dead one is just a casualty of war and another thing to pin on Hamas. I encourage you to listen to stories of hostages that have been released, if you can. Not from those of them that describe humane and respectful treatment by their captors, but from those who describe seeing their neighbors and family members blown apart as collateral by the IDF forces who had supposedly come to rescue them. This isn‚Äôt about hostages. This isn‚Äôt about rockets. They‚Äôre already starting to plan beach resort developments on the leveled coastal neighborhoods while people starve and are killed in REFUGEE CAMPS. In addition Israel is destroying foreign human aid workers aiding refugee camps. 

The point of this isn‚Äôt to shake my fist and curse the nature of war and the violence of humans. It‚Äôs to explicitly accuse the state of Israel of using this invasion and ‚Äúwar against Hamas‚Äù as a convenient excuse to annex Gaza, and ultimately the West Bank, and clear out the civilian population that lives there, dead or alive. This is blatantly obvious when you look at the civilian death tolls in comparison to the number of Hamas militants that have actually been killed. The fact that Mossad could likely erase anyone from the face of the Earth and yet widespread annihilation of hospitals, aid trucks, universities, residences, and known hostage sites is somehow the only way to eliminate Hamas operatives. The genocidal rhetoric of the Israeli government comparing Gazans to vermin that must be exterminated. The fact that Oct. 7th was even able to happen. The intentional exaggeration of the violence that was inflicted in order to justify a scorched earth response. 

It‚Äôs the same way that I can‚Äôt understand how an attack that killed 3,000 Americans, despite the horrific nature of that attack, justifies an invasion of Iraq (a country not involved in the attack) that results in ~500,000 (some sources claim a million) civilian casualties because ‚Äúthey have WMDs‚Äù (a claim the US government issued knowing there was no proof of this). Except I do ‚Äî propaganda. We have all been conditioned to accept the indiscriminate deaths of countless thousands of people from across the world as an ‚Äúacceptable loss‚Äù in order to further the military ambitions of Western nations. It‚Äôs the same in Gaza right now. Don‚Äôt let them sell you that",15,1718067020.0,t1_l81me4m
1dcualz,l8233n6,NoNewPuritanism,"Don't worry, Israel does not want to annex the west bank and gaza. Much like the surrounding middle eastern countries, Israel does not want accept millions of palestinians into their territory. Nor does Israel want to perpetrate a genocide. If they were they wouldn't have allowed the population to increase in the last 20 years leading up to this war. Israel simply wants to be left alone.

You have clearly swallowed the propaganda from Iran. You see the reports about humane treatment. I've seen reports about [beatings and death threats](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/freed-israeli-hostages-tell-families-beatings-death-threats-2023-11-29/). Hamas is an unorganized collective, so maybe there were some groups that treated the hostages they were responsible for humanely. It doesn't discount the fact that they were fucking kidnapped and removed from their daily lives, and that's not mention Stockholm syndrome. 

Mossad isn't made of super soldiers, and neither are Israeli special forces. Look at Grozny, Look at fallujah. Soldiers die in Urban combat. Israel simply does not want to let Israeli soldiers die, so they do everything by air. This leads to more collateral. There is not higher or deeper meaning to Israel's tactics. 

Hamas has never requested a ceasefire solely for releasing hostages. Hamas asks for nearly 10 times more Palestinians to be freed from Israeli prisons (many of whom undertook terrorist attacks on Israeli soil in the past). If Hamas solely asked for a ceasefire in return for all Hostages, Israel would accept immediately.

The only thing I wanted to justify with this post was the strikes and protests as the only tangible way to achieve change in institutions like ours where the Regents are protecting their pockets while us students are seeking dignity and to represent an establishment that they can respect and feel represented by in return.

And then you say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre justifying Hamas‚Äô actions! You‚Äôre anti-semitic!‚Äù Bro I am part Ashkenazi Jew please don‚Äôt make me laugh. I am not trying to justify the actions of Hamas.

And if you can justify Israel‚Äôs use of this amount of deadly force against civilians because it is in response to Hamas‚Äô violence against them, I fail to see how that does not justify more, even greater use of force from Hamas in response to Israel‚Äôs violence.

(This is a ridiculous analogy, but imagine if 100 terrorists had just killed 25 people, wounding 30 more, in downtown SC and now were hiding out in porter B. Now imagine the national guard bombs the building, killing 80 of the terrorists. Now imagine 250 students were also killed from the blasts, including 50 children from FSH being crushed by rubble, and 300 more were injured in the damage. Is that an appropriate response? Is the reckless and wanton loss of civilian life on this scale worth the execution of military goals? Worth avenging the innocents who died? If I was killed by a terrorist I hope to whatever God there is that it doesn‚Äôt become a justification for warmongers to wipe out a dozen families just to get my killer. Maybe those who kill others do deserve death. But how many more must be killed to deliver that punishment to them? At what point is it not worth the cost of human life?)",2,1718138056.0,t1_l82o9mn

Netanyahu allowed Hamas to rise to power in order to cut off the Palestinian Authority from Gaza and weaken their attempts at forming a Palestinian state. This is generally known policy in Israel, who had known about Hamas‚Äô plans to act on Oct. 7th for months in advance, with official reports saying they dismissed the attack as impossible to execute. Hamas‚Äô aggression has always been used as justification for stripping Palestinians of rights and essentially imprisoning them in Gaza, which the Human Rights Watch and dozens of other organizations label as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs largest open-air prison.‚Äù It is politically convenient for the Israeli government to allow Hamas to remain in power.

They will tell the world ‚Äúwe are simply taking back what is ours.‚Äù And the world will nod and we will tell each other that it doesn‚Äôt matter how many thousands of mothers and fathers and babies and lovers and friends and families must be blown apart in order to defeat the Hamas devils. And the world will not ask Israel how it is that Hamas came to power, and what instigated the lasting conflict that has culminated in this destruction today. They will not ask why the United Kingdom and United States are allowed to build nations on top of existing ones, and crush the people underneath for a hundred years until they are all squeezed out. They will simply cheer on as the terrorists are killed, not noticing the tears mixed into the rivers of blood they now stand in.",2,1718146682.0,t1_l86ovr1
1dcualz,l86xukj,quarrelreef,"In august 2023 there were over 1,200 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons without charges, ability to hold trial, or release dates. As well as 3,000 additional prisoners facing charges, some just for protesting peacefully. The hostages taken were a bargaining chip for the release of Palestinian political prisoners. Israeli military reports claim that 20 of these are between age 16-18. 70% of Gazans are refugees, and 50% are under the age of 18. For every 2 civilian casualties in Gaza, one is likely a child. Of the 1 million projected to be starving in Gaza by July, 500,000 will be children. So for me the outcome where half a million kids starve and 10,000 more are burnt to a crisp isn‚Äôt the one I can support. But you go ahead and cheer on as Hamas is destroyed, with only the cost of every human being in Gaza being displaced, wounded, starved, or killed. 

Look up Yasmin Porat. She was held as a hostage in Be‚Äôeri in the Oct. 7th battle, and a Hamas soldier released her and surrendered to the IDF, who had the neighborhood they were in surrounded. IDF soldiers ‚Äúrescued‚Äù the 12 other hostages held captive by Hamas by firing a tank into the building they were in, killing nearly all the hostages. 

Look up the Hannibal Directive, in regard to Israeli prisoners being taken by retreating enemy fighters: ""the kidnapping must be stopped by all means, even at the price of striking and harming our own forces."" Supposedly this policy ended in 2016. 

IDF Air Force Col. Nof Erez claimed that Oct. 7th was a ‚Äúmass Hannibal‚Äù where the directive was ‚Äúapparently applied.‚Äù 

12-year-old Liel Hastroni was one of the Israeli hostages killed by IDF tanks in the Be‚Äôeri massacre. Her burnt body was shared on social media along with claims that Hamas had done this to her for being Jewish. These kinds of reports helped to drum up international support for the coming scorched Earth response, and to dehumanize Palestinians in the public eye.",2,1718148155.0,t1_l86u61a

Hell my Grandpa served in Vietnam and he even says we should never have gone. To go even further the Vietnam protests were very unpopular when they were occurring while today they are seen as absolutely necessary and have high support so the only explanation for the 180 in public opinion is that the protesters were eventually vindicated as many see the Vietnam war as how the protesters saw them at the time. What was once marginalized is now mainstream opinion much like how the civil rights era was eventually vindicated.

This reminds me of the time almost 10 years ago now when students chained themselves together to block highway 1 to protest literally a bunch of stuff at once like blm, UC grad student stuff, conflicts in Syria at the time, and whatever else all rolled into one. Reason I know it was so broad was because I knew one of the people who chained themselves and was one of the organizers and when I asked them why they did it they listed those things.

They ended up blocking highway 1 from ocean st for several hours during morning commute traffic and all they did was make the already strained relationship between the town and the school even more strained while getting themselves arrested, expelled and I believe some court ordered community service and probation. No one gave a crap about what they were there for, they just wanted to get to work and thought that a bunch of people who chained themselves to each other and then to cement blocks was the dumbest reason for being late to work by several hours.

All those causes are just and shouldn‚Äôt be confused with the actions of a bunch of main characters who want media attention at the expense of their fellow students or bystanders. All that‚Äôs happening here is a valid initial reaction of ‚Äúwhy is this happening to me? Why am I being dragged into this? I got blah blah blah to do!‚Äù That‚Äôs all fair, these protesters should be punching up not down or sideways. 

There are other things they could be doing that affects the regents rather than the students and staff who for the most part agree that what‚Äôs happening in Gaza is a historic atrocity but feel that there isn‚Äôt much they can do. Now these people are pissed and maybe will have a harder time separating a messed up thing happening halfway around the world with this messed up thing happening at them for what feels like no reason to them right here when they just wanna finish their classes and go home.

Anyway to those of you affected by blocked entrances you‚Äôre valid in your frustration, but please try not to let it affect your overall sense of right and wrong just because a bunch of people feel like they need to make you pay attention to current events in a way that directly affects your life in this moment.

1hll5nn,m3n8386,DragonfruitWZRD,"Im an alumn, when I was a freshmen I felt the same thing. Lonely despite having a good group of friends and being busy with social life and school. Wished there was more school spirit, a sports team, a lot of things my friends from home had at their respective universities. 

In the end I stayed and loved it. A few friends (small amount) left and transferred or dropped out for personal reasons. The ones who stayed, and me, still wished some of those things. 

But at the end of the day, for me it was more a matter of adjusting to everything that college is. Being away from home, your friends you may have known for years, home cooked meals‚Ä¶ but also adjusting to everything NEW while feeling pretty empty inside. 

I think this adjustment period might follow you in many new places. Yes, schools with more school spirit as you said, may have more things to distract you from that feeling of adjustment, but that could just be at face value. 

In my experience, for all that me and my friends complained about UCSC, we also grew with it. I met up with 2 of my best friends recently and we all agree we wouldn‚Äôt have changed that experience. 

I think you grow with it. And it is a pretty unusual experience in many aspects lol. You‚Äôre not in a city and the city isn‚Äôt the most accessible. There‚Äôs a lot more I could list off that made ucsc a hard adjustment. 

But again, speaking personally, I wouldn‚Äôt have changed it and I always tell people I love my experience there. At the end of the day, I think the people around you are what really shape your experience. I have a very hard time to any life adjustments and it did take a while, like more than a quarter or two to feel more settled, and it happened gradually. 

Like I said, I personally grew with it. Those walks around campus sometimes felt lonely at times, but I also grew to love them 

If you‚Äôre feeling overwhelmed with it all, and the option to transfer, that‚Äôs definitely understandable and I think you should think about your options. But also just remind yourself you‚Äôre doing a huge new thing, and sometimes it takes time. But again, speaking personally. 

Be proud that you‚Äôre making a step and actively thinking about what‚Äôs best for you! Just don‚Äôt try to force your brain into of all your options 100% of the time. Maybe you just need to live it out a bit more?

Like, however college is portrayed in an Extremely Goofy Movie, SC was the opposite. No sports or school spirit, no central quad alive with students, few good study areas, few vast lecture halls (45 people in a classroom will get old fast), a pathetic gym (seriously, a great gym is a staple of most 4-year school experiences), no bona fide Greek life, a campus layout which quite actively inhibits student congregation, no sense of a ‚Äúcollege town‚Äù (but rather a town locale distended by a hill and which seems to have 0 interest in embracing or even acknowledging its UC student population), parties? ha!‚Ä¶ and the students‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs just say the facilities are only half the problem in terms of a lack of socialization. I was super lonely. Not to disparage anyone reading this, but I felt like almost everyone I‚Äôd meet was introverted, awkward, plain old weird, or even downright mean-spirited. I was pretty unhappy there my first two years. But I‚Äôll say this: finding just one good friend, and learning to love my environment, I learned to love life in sc by the end. SC is quite literally one of the most beautiful environment in California, and getting to live in a small town right on the ocean and in the mountains like that is something I dearly, dearly miss now that I‚Äôve moved. Somewhere in my junior year or so, I began to care less about the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù I had missed‚Äîthose things listed above‚Äîand started to view my time there almost  as like a 4-year educational vacation. (My family is not wealthy, either, but I was able to afford housing. If you‚Äôre below that threshold, SC will be one of the greatest nightmares you can imagine. But, I‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre not.) The town is small enough to be laid-back and comfortable, aside from the homeless. The air is fresh, the scenery is unbeatable. Hiking, running, beaching, surfing, bikeable small town, redwood mountains, tide pools, etc. are the kinds of things people pay millions to live around. Learn to enjoy some aspect of that, and I assure you you‚Äôll be missing it by the time you have to leave.
But, maybe that‚Äôs just not you. Maybe you‚Äôre not someone who‚Äôs going to have a profound love for living oceanside, or in the forest, or ever get over the soreness for missing a typical college experience.

Every quarter got better and by the end of my first year I was totally hooked. UCSC was a deeply transformative experience for me. When I graduated I got massively depressed because I knew it was an exceptional time in my life that I‚Äôd never get back again, with peers also going thru exciting and massive life changes, and being able to be intellectually and socially stimulated in a stunning environment.

They just put on an Earth Day teach-in and march, which admittedly, I heard did have low attendance. Part of the reason things have slowed down recently might be that we actually won some key victories. A major demand was that our university begin the process of decarbonizing and moving towards the shutdown of the campus methane plant. Our march on Earth Day 2022 actually got us a meeting with the chancellor where we made our case. She actually started a planning process which got us an [plan to decarbonize](https://sustainability.ucsc.edu/initiatives/decarb-electrific.html) (potentially) by 2030! But I do hope students keep an eye on that to make sure it gets implemented.

Obviously there is a lot more the university can do for climate too though, and one of them is actually financial divestment from fossil fuel-supporting firms and banks. So to be honest I'm not really disappointed that climate is not in ""the spotlight"" right now. When students and youth make their voices heard, and especially when they win, it sets the precedents that push our voices forward. In the case of recent protests demanding divestment/isolation from Israel, If the students succeed, it will undoubtedly make fossil fuel divestment/denormalization a lot easier. In fact it may even happen at the same time, considering many of these problem firms are the same (BlackRock, etc).

Requiring one to stop driving in order to truly work for change feels unrealistic. A movement could never happen at that point. 

One can be a driver and still fight and work towards changes in access to quick and efficient public transit, so that they can eventually decrease their car-dependency. They can fight for the increase in public bike paths (like that Santa Cruz greenway proposal) for those that can use it, even if they themselves will never use them.

1ck3mlb,l2lmmli,Unique_Ingenuity8216,"I agree that our population is too spread out but I think this is more of an issue at the local scale (suburbanization, lack of urban public transit) than it is at the national scale. Though we obviously do also need to expand our long-distance rail infrastructure in order to reduce the GHG emissions from aircraft.

Fukushima occurred in 2011 and the reactors that failed were General Electric Mark I boiling water reactors, which are pretty much identical to every commercial plant that is operating around the world today, even the ones that were built with quote-unquote *modern* technology. Some countries implemented very stringent regulations in the wake of Fukushima to decrease the likelihood of radioactive gas being released into the atmosphere during a meltdown, but the US was not one of these countries, as the NRC is a captured agency that has long prioritized industry profits above public safety. Nuclear reactors in the US are as susceptible today as they were during the Cold War to flooding, earthquakes, wildfires, water shortages, terrorist attacks, or anything else that would cause the power to go out for even a short period of time.¬†

Furthermore, nuclear plants are extremely expensive (about $112-189 per MegaWatt-hour, compared to $36-44 for solar and¬† $29-56 for onshore wind), making it difficult for them to compete with renewables on the free market. See Vogtle Units III &amp; IV in Georgia as an example, which finally came online last week more than $21 billion over budget and 8 years behind schedule due to construction delays. France, China and South Korea‚Äôs nuclear capacity has mushroomed in recent decades mainly as a result of generous government subsidies and state-owned electric utilities. Such growth would not be possible under US capitalism. Given nuclear power's risks and the fact that we still have no permanent geologic repository in which to store the waste, I think this is a good thing, in my humble opinion.

In the winter of 1999, a friend of mine committed suicide in the Porter A Building. It was a traumatic experience for everyone that year. 

Several years after this, someone who had never heard about this, came running up to me during spring break in tears. He explained that he saw a bloody figure in the location where my friend died. After that, there were always rumors of a ghost in that corner of the building. 

However, once the major renovation of Porter happened in the late 00's and we turned that building into the Transfer Community, the ghost stories went away.",30,1717520013.0,t3_1d7znvu

1d7znvu,l74fvvo,throwra_3387,"I‚Äôve heard of people seeing sasquatches in the woods on campus and up in the mountains. I‚Äôve never experienced it myself, but I remember a few years back I‚Äôd see a post about it every so often. There are a lot of stick lean-tos and other structures on campus that are often attributed to Bigfoot, but I‚Äôve always figured they were student built. I also remember hearing about a deer kill somewhere in upper campus back during Covid, the bones being strewn about, but I‚Äôm not sure I can chalk that up to Sasquatch necessarily.

Everyone‚Äôs heard of the Porter ghost stories. I know someone mentioned a suicide in 1999, but there are ghost stories from Porter dating back to before the Loma Prieta earthquake in ‚Äò89. While some stories are apparitions, most seem to be unexplainable foot steps and similar experiences. In a dorm building with pipes running through basically every room, I‚Äôm assuming that the pipes are responsible for some (though certainly not all) of those experiences.

Outside of that, I‚Äôve personally found giant mushrooms in the woods that I can‚Äôt explain. Far too big for anything that‚Äôs supposed to be growing there. Of course, I never find anything but the stalks and bits of the cap. I‚Äôve never seen a full mushroom of considerable size, but based on the size of the stalks they must be massive. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0‚Äù and a bit on the chunky side and I‚Äôve found stalks larger than my forearm. Not a ghost story or even necessarily paranormal, admittedly, but interesting nonetheless. Given the magic much of the campus is alleged to be subject to, I guess it makes sense.

Also saw a UFO fly over campus once. I‚Äôm not sure what it was, too quick and silent to be a plane or a drone. Just a series of red lights, moving in a V formation very quickly over Porter meadow. Lasted all of about 10 seconds before they were too far out to get a picture of. I was sober, before anyone asks.

Outside of campus, there are multiple Victorian era homes that are rumored to be haunted. I know the purple one downtown is supposed to be. Ocean Street Extension near the freeway entrance is also supposedly haunted by a girl in white. And, though it‚Äôs most likely been explained by now, the Moore‚Äôs Beach Monster that washed up at Natural Bridges back in 1925 was for almost a century a complete mystery. It‚Äôs now thought to have been a decaying Baird‚Äôs beaked whale, but they‚Äôre not generally known to swim close to shore so I‚Äôm not sure how likely it is that‚Äôs the actual answer. Of course, like most things of that era, no one thought to collect samples of it or anything so who knows.",3,1717534965.0,t3_1d7znvu

It‚Äôs like how if you‚Äôre in a car and a biker is in your lane, you don‚Äôt **have to** swerve into the opposing car lane blindly, you should slow down until it‚Äôs safe to pass.

Check out the curriculum chart for the CS BA, there's a lot of interesting CS-adjacent classes that don't require any actual programming. You can replace 4 of the upper divison CS courses with those non-CS electives. You still have to take 4 CS upper-divs (your choice) but it gives you the option to avoid the really painful classes (and some of the more useless ones too). Upper division classes are a little more fun btw, I'm having a good time taking some of the machine learning classes even though algorithms and C makes me want to puke. Keep in mind if you ever want to get a real software engineering position your skills will be... patchy, but if you're considering some other fields it might be worth a shot.

Generally this was met with shock and concern, but the point I made was that UCSC is great at fostering young people to figure themselves out and pursue what inspires them the most. I‚Äôd also note that we can even create new majors with faculty support!

So to answer your question, yes lots of people go through this. Being able to rediscover yourself is a rare opportunity so take advantage of it! Have a professor you like? Chat with them in office hours about what path you might want to go on. Think there‚Äôs a unique issue with the world you want to fix? Focus on that and let it guide you to the right major.

So, if you swap to TIM, make sure you network and explore early. You can definitely apply for an engineering program/project management (EPM) internship and pursue it as a career path. 

I‚Äôm currently not an EPM but a lot of what I do is program based so basically a program manager without the title.

1czwf4i,l5l7i8u,afrosphere,"I would recommend writing a thesis to prepare you for writing papers if you choose to stay in the academic career parh. As for starting your astrophysics path at UCSC, congratulations! I would like to share that surviving around the bay area may be difficult if you don't find all the necessary safety nets. For starters, the housing crisis and inflation has been a challenge during my time at SC. So to survive and not go into debt I went on and found these following resources: Calfresh (snap program, provides a monthly grocery allowance to you), slug support (surplus insurance from UCSC by students for students, if you ever need financial help they can provide a hand), MSI/ACE tutoring program, scholarships sources like stem diversity, physics dept undergrad summer scholarships, and networking with great, humble friends and mentors.

The UCSC physics and astro department are defined as 1 department. The astrophysics program at ucsc is one of the best research programs around the world. There are many notable faculty and researchers involved in topics like cosmology, high energy particle physics, early universe, and stellar formation. Prof. Enrico Ramirez, Prof. Sandra Faber, Prof. Michael Dine, just to name a few. Since ucsc is leading the nation with their adaptive optics facility, and it's home to the UC observatory headquarters, you'll have many amazing and once in a lifetime opportunities to get involved in a diverse collaboration and to use some of the most beautiful telescopes available in the world to observe the our vast universe with utmost precision.

When you come to UCSC it'll be a very unique experience full of growth and humbling, especially in the physics department. I have to admit that it was my physics undergrad cohort and the grad students I hanged out with who have mentored me and radicalized to understand the importance of science for the people through comradishop and solidarity. If you do come over to UCSC, don't be afraid to learn about mutual aid efforts around the area, socialize with others, and learn what life has to offer aside from your academic career. UCSC is the closest that the UC system will ever get to a true public institution that serves the public, a research institution that can provide resources to working class students in this capitalist fasc neolib hellhole, organized by the working class student workforce, and focused in cultivating a rich community of radical and out of the world ideas.

It‚Äôs only $1200 a month, and everything is included, you‚Äôll be in the middle of town almost, so you just walk like 8 minutes to the bus station and it takes you to and fro campus. 

I was a grad student from 21-22, so we were at the end of Covid(omicron variant forced us to go remote for a month or so), so bc of that we were allowed to live in the hotel all year since they basically had minimal business at that time and they were happy to have people in the rooms. I looked into the old pre-Covid contracts, and they were for 1 quarter only, then you had to find your own place, however there were only like 10-15 or so of us in the hotel, so with all the difficulties students have finding housing, and the limited number of spots on campus, I wouldn‚Äôt be too surprised if they still allow the full year contract like they did for me.

Either way, it‚Äôs worth it. At first I was afraid of not having a kitchen, and it is a slight hassle, buuuuut, just buy an electric double burner and cook on it. 

You‚Äôre definitely not supposed to have a burner, so put shower caps over the smoke alarms and open the windows just in case, then hide it on the days when the cleaning ladies are coming through for you. Frankly tho, I smoked weed every day in the room and blew it out the window and never set off any alarms, so I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about getting busted.

At the time, they offered a suite, so it‚Äôs bigger than a little dorm, you have a living room and a bedroom, and a large bathroom. The internet was unreliable bc so many of us were using it at the same time, but they upgraded it, and it worked fine after, so assuming they still use the same hotel, you should be good.

Even if they forced you to leave after 1 quarter, you‚Äôd still have a much easier time figuring out housing once you‚Äôve had a couple months to look in person.

Honestly, they hotel living sich made the whole thing so easy, and way cheaper, especially considering I didn‚Äôt have any roommates, and some of my cohort was in the hotel with me, so you could study or work together when needed.

Just try and make sure you get a window room, a buddy of mine had no window to the outside, just a window to the lobby, and that was depressing. He was only there mid week and then went back to Sac on the weekends, so it was do-able. I was full on living there tho, so if the room they assigned me didn‚Äôt have a window, I would have demanded a switch before moving all my stuff in.",4,1718642007.0,t3_1dhrdrm

1f32mz0,lkqi5r0,llama-lime,"The city is responsible for, at a minimum, *allowing* enough housing to be built. Instead, they have created an artificial shortage of housing by banning more housing from being built in nearly every single part of the city.

Santa Cruz got a greenbelt which stopped sprawl up the coast, which was a fantastic environmental win. But the other side of the green belt is that you need to allow building up, to allow more environmentally friendly living. Instead, we have induced tons of car traffic on Highway 1, by forcing people to live in Watsonville and commute. Santa Cruz has also decimated the mountain ecosystem by forcing sprawl development all throughout the Santa Cruz Mountains, which is a serious problem for mountain lions and other fauna. 

Recent state law has started forcing cities to allow slightly housing to be built. But the powerful landowning side of Santa Cruz (landlords and homeonwers) mightily resist more homes, because more housing means lower rents.  There's also a false-environmentalist sensibility that single family homes with lawns are somehow better for the environment than dense living. This is of course completely ridiculous, but unfortunately very common in older populations, that like to think their big lawn is a sign of living in ""nature"" and therefore better for the environment.",2,1725052449.0,t1_lkmesfb

And the amount of actual new housing is absolutely tiny compared to the need. Seriously, add up all those new units, how many years (up to a decade) it takes to get a building going, and you will find it seriously underwhelming.

The only reason we are getting any housing at all, even this very small amount, is because the state passed new laws overturning Santa Cruz City's ability to block housing.

There needs to be housing *all over* Santa Cruz, not a handful of large buildings *only*. This town has been unchanged for decades, so a few bulidings seem like a massive change, but in a real city that people want to live in, it should be increasding its housing stock by a minimum of 1% per year to match population growth, or more likely 2%-5% for places that are desirable where lots of people want to live.

1f32mz0,ll2ujiq,llama-lime,"&gt; because the mindless growth imperative of the UC system is applying so much pressure to the local housing situation.

This is so wrong. ""Mindless growth imperative"" shows that you have not even bothered to understand the issue. UCOP has been very moderate in its growth demands.

&gt;You are simply wrong to pretend that the new developments are only occurring downtown; 

This is not what I said! You were the one that said: ""massive new apartment complexes going up all over downtown Santa Cruz"" and I merely said ""highly visible spaces"" which was more accurate than your own words. To then say that I'm the one in the wrong is a bit funny.

As for one going up in Seabright, it must not be ""massive"" is it? It hasn't hit this map at least.

https://santacruzlocal.org/housing-and-construction/


&gt;this dismissive attitude toward the understandable concerns of the local population has really begun to grate on the larger Santa Cruz community

It's not the ""larger"" Santa Cruz community, it's a small subset of super-loud and aggressive busy bodies. People may not want to push back against you, because you are so confrontational, but I get a *lot* of support for my positions face to face, as well as online. I know this supposed ""larger"" community is a paper tiger in terms of size. It may have had the money and the power and the influence, but that is fading as it becomes smaller.

&gt; These new housing developments will transform Santa Cruz, mostly for the better I think, but there will inevitably be repercussions that the residents should take seriously.

Lol, they are so small, they do basically nothing to the community at all, except slightly slow price increases. Sure, the shady end of Pacific is going to look a lot nicer (at least for a while) but until we build enough so that we can keep prices down and families in the community, it's going to have little effect on the gradual displacement of our locals and of anybody with less than $400k/year of annual income.

 &gt; facing a budgetary shortfall of over $100 million. Maybe if the university were managing its own affairs with any degree of competence the pressure would not be so acute.

And why is that? If you think that it's UCSC's fault, then you are as bad at evaluating the university's situation as you are evaluating the housing situation. It's not like they suddenly overspent $100m. It's that funding was suddenly cut by a massive amount. And they are not allowed to keep around excess funds to smooth over the differences.

Instead, this budgetary shortfall is emblematic of the exact same greed  and parasitism that homeowners exhibit in housing. In the late 1970s, the libertarian Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association both destroyed the stable tax base of property tax, and also prevented the government from keeping extra funds year-to-year to smooth over bugetary differences (the Gann Limit). This means that California has lower taxes than Texas, but also that most of our tax revenue comes from income taxes, and especially from capital gains which are taxed as income in California. This means that the state budget is completely exposed to the business cycle of the Californian economy, which means that in good times for tech it has more money that it can spend and it's not allowed to save it, and in bad times, every agency goes through brutal cuts.

This is the fundamental greed of the generation of Boomers. And I am not at all attributing this to every Boomer, many of whom foresaw these terrible results and fought hard against them. Nonetheless, the state has been set up to completely benefit the wealthiest Boomers, at the expense of younger generations and those who work. Failure to acknowldege the basic reality that future generations face, on a UCSC subreddit, is a bit rich.",1,1725239686.0,t1_ll1sjdp

Perhaps it does for you if you are adhering to the SJP manifesto that basically states there should be no more nations  or national boundaries globally .  However my guess is that you appreciate the US and being a US citizen and don‚Äôt want the US to disappear.  Well that‚Äôs how I feel about Israel.

Possibly worst rent floor in the world though. 1/3 of the county lives 2+ to a room; tons of people living outdoors (both students &amp; regular townies).

2. There's a ton of stuff during welcome week for everyone, and then a couple events per quarter. Beyond that it's stuff that your college/RAs put on. You're also in a forest and like ten minutes from the beach! So if you're into outdoorsy stuff there's a lot to do.   
3. I'm in engineering so not sure. I know anecdotally our earth and marine sciences is crazy good though.  
4. Again not sure. We do have public practice rooms though and I go in a lot to play piano and it's pretty well maintained. Haven't met an unfriendly music major either.   
5. Weather is like a little too hot in the fall, pretty cold in the winter, and perfect in the spring.   
6. The college system is kind of insane. We don't have a center of campus but rather a bunch of individual colleges with their own amenities and culture, and you choose one of them to dorm in. Your experience here is kind of dictated by which college you dorm in so def do your research on that.   
7. The campus itself is pretty safe. We had a pretty scary incident with a bus last year though so make sure you don't get on any old looking busses.   
8. We only have one year of guaranteed housing, but I was able to get an on campus apartment no problem my second year. I also don't know of anybody personally who went for on campus housing and didn't get it. Off campus has some great spots if you have money, and some meh spots if you're on a budget.

The science department is good, yes. Again, it varies. But our science programs are diligent.

One of my best friends was in the music scene at UCSC; he loved it. Never heard of ego much but music will probably always have some people like that.

Weather was meh. It's sunny sometimes, cloudy sometimes, and pouring storm rain sometimes.

Campus is very safe. Downtown and near Ocean street weren't. It's a college and beach town; it'll have its places.

1hlooji,m3ugul8,duwwy,"hii!! current freshman here affiliated with porter college!

1) people are generally super friendly! if you‚Äôre interested in something super niche, you‚Äôre bound to encounter some people with the same interest.
I‚Äôd say there are def a few cliques but generally not so much. everyone here has been super welcoming and kind. pretty much all freshmen in porter are in one big (active) groupchat together where we often share items and send invitations to parties and events and such. as for diversity, the school is pretty diverse. you‚Äôre bound to find people from all types of different backgrounds here.

2) yes! I don‚Äôt party or drink at all and theres a lot for me to do on campus. theres a lot of clubs that host fun events + downtown always has something happening. theres a venue near campus called the catalyst that almost always has some artist or drag queen performing and its really fun. most of the stuff to do revolves around your friends and making plans with them, but theres always something to do, so it doesnt become too stale.

3) cannot answer for science/music personally but my friends in those fields are finding them generally pretty good!

4) the first two weeks or so of moving in we had a massive heatwave that was so so insufferable. I‚Äôm from socal and even I was overwhelmed. the weather also gets so frigid sometimes you feel the cold in your bones. so, prepare for hot hot hot (90+¬∞) and COLD (‚âà30¬∞)

5) make sure you do research on what college you want to apply to (within ucsc) before picking it as your top choice. I know a lot of people that randomly chose one of the 10 colleges and aren‚Äôt very happy there. as a porter affiliate, I can really only speak for porter, but I find porter to be remarkably beautiful and welcoming. with the koi pond, frequent nearby events, 2 dining halls super close by, and porter market all within a 5 minute walk from my dorm I never feel like I‚Äôve got nowhere to go. personal addition- I love porter market‚Äôs coffee. porter is near sewers tho so you will def smell it some days. its also the artsy college, so like everyone here is gay lol.

6) very very safe. I frequently walk back to my dorm at porter from cowell (other side of campus, 20ish min walk) at 12-2am and have never felt unsafe. as long as you stay generally vigilant you won‚Äôt really run into any issues. I have heard of a few guys pushing themselves into girls rooms/getting girls drunk to try and.. you know. but as far as I know, other people have stepped in and prevented anything super serious from happening, so the community here does look out for each other.

7) ahh, the dorms. they‚Äôre available your first year, and then 2nd-4th is a raffle. but honestly, they‚Äôre a 50/50 on whether they suck really bad or not. we had the laundry room catch fire, a flood on my floor, half the bathrooms in the building all out of service, etc. mind you, its only been a single quarter. I‚Äôd say its a really good experience for making friends; leaving your door open on welcome week genuinely creates so many openings for friends. people will just walk in and hang out, they‚Äôve got nothing better to do. I like the dorms, I like my roommates, and I would def do it again if I could, but that doesn‚Äôt erase the obvious issues that they have. I wish the school put some of my (very expensive out of state) tuition towards fixing them up but oh well. 

I‚Äôm not sure how informative this will be for you, or if its just a giant mess of words, but if you‚Äôre not looking for a party school but also not looking for something insanely study focused (though it can be if you want) this is a good choice for you.",4,1735197655.0,t3_1hlooji

1. Id say people are very friendly. there's ""clique"" (im using this term very loosely) as theres groups of people with niche interests. many people are very welcoming! ive met some good friends here at UCSC. obviously theres some bad apples but thats with every school/job/event ect. 

2. we have a big smoke out session on 4/20 but there is hardcore shows and local bands that play in downtown santa cruz or near soquel occasionally. there is many activities you can do in santa cruz besides drinking. we have a huge forest that you can explore with friends and find some pretty cool structures and art. 

3. the science department is actually really good in my opinion. some professors are hit or miss, but i overall had good experiences with them. theres many resources for science majors if needed. make sure to take those opportunities!

4. cant help here, i dont know much about the music department. you do have a cool looking building tho! 

5. the weather is typical beach weather. it doesnt get blazing hot and dry but it can get cold quick. just make sure to dress appropriately for weather changes like you would in any other city. it is advice as you are hiking to most of your classes you might want to wear appropriate clothing as you can get hot and sticky real quick. 

6. santa cruz gets expensive as many other states in this thread. there is many free markets in which you can go! you can also go to free produce markets if you like :)

7. campus is very much isolated from the rest of santa cruz. take that as you will 

8. 1st years get priority and automatic housing. most people after that have to rent or apply through the housing lottery system. i am personally living off campus and its not bad! i know some people are commuting from capitola and aptos which is a pain in the ass with the bus system. so if you are looking for housing in those areas be mindful on transportation and commuting!",1,1735537990.0,t3_1hlooji

1hd9jdp,m1waxx2,kyperion,"I‚Äôm in the opinion that this unintended gatekeeping.

One exam ends the entirety of your effort from over the quarter because of plagiarism concerns. Enter the workforce and you immediately notice that nobody actually requires the exact level of memorization that some faculty expect from undergraduate students.

If your concern is with students that submit others work as their own, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs your job to intentionally try and weed them out. Your job is to support students who are trying learn and understand the fundamentals of their field. The system will naturally push out cheaters as it is very evident to employers when a student is capable of approaching a problem in a productive manner. The policy does catch those who cheat, but you‚Äôre also affecting students who might have just had a bad day, don‚Äôt work well under exams, or misunderstood instructions on the exam itself. 

You might as well just make all of the course content optional and only use the final exam in determining a students grade at that point. The ones who will cheat won‚Äôt even use them; so why do you force it onto all of the other students who may not want to waste time on things that don‚Äôt get counted at the end of the quarter.",-5,1734114615.0,t3_1hd9jdp
1hd9jdp,m1wdbds,RedsonRising99,Disagree. Employers don't want to waste time and money with the hiring process then trying to train an employee just to fire them 6 months later. It's a waste of time and effort and puts the burden on the rest of the employees to pick up the slack.  It's the schools job to weed out the students that can't hack it (elementary and up). They need to stop passing it up the line for someone else to deal with. This participation trophy mentality needs to stop.,-5,1734115370.0,t1_m1waxx2
1hd9jdp,m1wdk6z,kyperion,"An employer should have caught this during the initial interviews and onboarding process. You‚Äôre telling me that after multiple interviews that are supposed to gauge how someone works on team and approaches problems, the companies still hire on the cheaters? Sounds like the issue is with the employer.

It‚Äôs their job so I don‚Äôt get why they get to push it onto academia who also have to deal with the same issues that companies have to deal with.",-1,1734115448.0,t1_m1wdbds
1hd9jdp,m1wem1u,RedsonRising99,"Bullsh*t. Some people interview really well. I've seen it. Tough interview questions and an exam that's not easy to pass, and the person was horrible. You've got it turned around by the way, academia shouldn't push their issues off on business. You pass everyone you end up with a horrible educational system... Oh wait, that's where we are now.",1,1734115782.0,t1_m1wdk6z
1hd9jdp,m1wi1m4,kyperion,"Academia isn‚Äôt pushing the issue onto businesses. It‚Äôs an issue everyone needs to account for. Look at any stem role right now and you‚Äôll see that everyone is trying to automate the system; to the point that they‚Äôre not rooting out the bad prospectives from the good ones.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs accurate to describe the entire education system as being bad. When it‚Äôs highly subjective and dependent on the person who is making use of said system. It has its problems, but forcing faculty to weed out cheaters which adds more work to their loads and strain onto their budgets will end up affecting others. This is a common complaint with CSE 150 Computer Networking where students are tested more on their photoshop/paint skills than actual computer networking.

1ffiokq,ln0l38o,ImagineBeingBored,"Well, to be fair, I only had him for 5B, so I can't say much about how he teaches his other classes (and I have heard that he was good for 5A). That said, I'm confident in saying that he never came to lectures with a plan (considering he spent the first 10 or so minutes of every class sitting at the board thinking about what to write), and that he often made mistakes in explanations/derivations that I imagine would've been fairly confusing if you didn't already understand the material. I can't comment necessarily on the quality of the lectures as I already knew most of the material from coursework in highschool, but I don't think his lectures would have been particularly useful had I not known the material. The class was pretty test heavy, but that's normal for physics so I wasn't too annoyed about it. I was, however, annoyed that he chose to cancel the 2nd midterm and instead of coming up with some other way to grade it, instead chose to count your performance on certain sections of the final for it instead (I could go into detail why but that's a whole other thing). He also, just as an aside, essentially said that if you perform poorly in his class you'll be replaced by AI, which I'll let you form your own opinions on.

Regardless, if you have to take him anyways, you should judge him for yourself. He isn't a bad guy and I do think he wants to help students learn, even if I think he has some poor pedagogical ideas and isn't a very good educator.",1,1726274364.0,t1_lmz552i

I‚Äôd be shocked if that wasn‚Äôt a policy he had for all his classes though. I‚Äôd aim for higher than 75% for your own benefit, but he was really cool about that.

Find someone in one of your classes or dorms that you think ‚Äúlooks chill‚Äù and just say what‚Äôs up. Cool people will respond well and people who suck aren‚Äôt people you should worry about anyways. You could join a club or fraternity (they aren‚Äôt as bad people make them out to be; my brother and a majority of close friends are in them).",5,1732353795.0,t1_lyjw5lq
1gxujoa,lyst5a0,gasstation-no-pumps,"Homesickness hits hardest around Thanksgiving and during the first winter quarter.  It doesn't matter much whether that is as a freshman or junior transfer.

You might want to hold on for your first year and see whether things turn around for you socially after that.  You could also make more effort to join clubs and study groups, which are two of the main social  mixing methods on campus.

But going to CC for two years is a cheaper alternative that is open to you, if you think that will work out better.",2,1732481785.0,t1_lyjw5lq

1gxujoa,lyl8ao4,FerrisTM,"As long as you can afford it, you can always come back (as far as I can tell.) I've dropped out eight times so far. They're always happy to readmit me. You do eventually get stripped of grants and scholarships, so that's something to be conscious of, but like I said: if you've got the money (and remain in decent academic standing) they'll take you back as many times as you want. I haven't found the limit.",3,1732375723.0,t3_1gxujoa
1gxujoa,lymjwg0,Alternative_Self_13,Finish out the year and then decide if you will come back next fall. Making friends can be hard but switch up from whatever strategy you were trying before. Join a club if you haven‚Äôt. Go to free events at your college and others if they interest you. Just saying ‚Äúhi‚Äù to people can make a difference.,3,1732391122.0,t3_1gxujoa

I'd say try to stick it out, it's only your first quarter and you may be seeing things through a magnifying glass right now.

Come up with a plan on how to improve your experience here and stick to it. That may mean getting out of your comfort zone too. 

You may want to seek help from the counseling folks in the health center too.",3,1732403893.0,t3_1gxujoa
1gxujoa,lymr0ba,DiddlyDooBear,"I‚Äôve done this and you should definitely do this. It‚Äôs called a LOA and as long as you finish your CC equivalents you‚Äôll have no problem going back to UCSC or even transferring out to any other 4 year. Pros: save money, better class structures, and less stress altogether. Cons: disconnect from 4 year community, can feel isolated and must stay locked in so that you don‚Äôt get trapped in the CC cycle.",2,1732393493.0,t3_1gxujoa
1gxujoa,lyntu9o,DismalToken,"I believe you will have to reapply if you are gone for 2 years. But if you are only gone 1 year, you can request a leave of absence for up to a year. Assuming they approve your request, you will not need to reapply and your status at the school will essentially be put on hold for a year. So you could do that and see how it is for a year. If you want to come back after that, you will be all set. If you don‚Äôt want to come back, just tell them a little in advance and you will no longer get enrolled",2,1732407073.0,t3_1gxujoa
1gxujoa,lynx3g7,OppositeHyena7070,"Sorry you are feeling this way! That's tough. :( I came from a CC. I think attending a cc is truly amazing. It's a little easier in the sense to build the leadership qualities you might not have developed yet, along with the confidence in yourself to see that you have these qualities. If that makes sense. You might want to connect with the cc you are thinking of because from my understanding, it is free for two years yes, but you might have to be incoming as a completely new college student, meaning no college experience. I'm not certain though. Please double check on that, reach out to admissions and or financial aid of the school you are looking into, explain your situation. From my experience CC's are extremely welcoming and really show that. Not that uc's don't, but at the cc level they have a little more wiggle room and have this sense of community. If you don't qualify for the free 2 years maybe see if you could claim as an independent so you can qualify for the bog waiver. I think it's called something else, but that way you can at least get your tuition paid for, again, talk to the financial aid office at the school of choice. Also in order to talk with them or make an appointment you might need to be a registered student. Which is free, you just need to submit your application/registration applications online. Then you should be good after a 48hr (most cc) processing period. By switching to a cc you would be able to utilize more student resources, from my knowledge. Again, don't know what cc though. I could be wrong. But just maybe talk with a counselor about this. It's difficult here I know but maybe even chat with a professor you have connect with, a TA, someone who might be able to give you some insight as they might have gone through similar experiences or know someone who does. 

  
The biggest con, which isn't really a con is the application process. You already made it here once. Who knows maybe after some time at a cc if you go that route you pick a different school. :) Don't fear this process though, like I said you already made it here. :)

  
I wish you the best of luck !",1,1732408264.0,t3_1gxujoa
1gxujoa,lypjcs9,benbookworm97,"Going to CC can allow you to explore at a lower cost. Transferring that to a UC/CSU is a built-in, streamlined process. But transferring courses within the UC system is known to be difficult because they're not designed with transferring mind; it's actually known to be difficult (there should be some relevant posts in this sub's history).
