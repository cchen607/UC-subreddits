Her profile is way too lightweight. Biden picked her in the first place to play the same old boring identity politics. Hell Biden was a desperate move made by the Dems to begin with. 

The key reason she substituted Joe Biden was that she got to legally keep the campaign funds. 

I expected Dems to at least divert some effort into helping secure the Congress. Because I noticed that Harris underperforms in two groups: black young males and general married females. Reasonably, underpeforming in those demographics led to underperforming in key battleground counties. Buck, Philadelphia, Montgomery and Delaware; Cobb, Fulton, DeKalb and Gwinnett. I drew the prediction that Donald Trump is favoured in Georgia and Pennsylvania. 

It turned out Harris underperformed in Atalanta and Philly as I expected, but Trump greatly overperformed in general. Not only did he win GA and PA, he secured every single swing state. 

What if Trump had more campaign money to run in a lean blue state like Virginia?

If an amateur like me could see a faint picture, I trust the strategists in the democratic party knew their outlook wasn't great. I trust that they knew much more. So I kept telling myself this was why Harris didn't seem to receive too much support. Maybe DEM tried to secure the Congress. 

And they did not. 

Judging by the exit poll, I guess the only conclusion of identity politics is that the black voters are heavily favouring Harris. Which makes every inch of sense because of US history, from the Mayflower to JFK. 

But women are not against the GOP. Latinos are not against the GOP. Young voters are not against the GOP. 

Nixon's silent majority should be taken seriously as always. We are at the age of media and social media. It doesn't mean the silent majority started to yell on platforms like X and Reddit. Biased information creates conformity. Conformity creates illusions. We cannot afford to live in an illusion.

1hdq31l,m1y3o4l,kitkat42000,"From this [article](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2024/12/13/openai-whistleblower-found-dead-in-san-francisco-apartment/), 

‚ÄúA former OpenAI researcher known for whistleblowing the blockbuster artificial intelligence company facing a swell of lawsuits over its business model has died, authorities confirmed this week.

Suchir Balaji, 26, was found dead inside his Buchanan Street apartment on Nov. 26, San Francisco police and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said. Police had been called to the Lower Haight residence at about 1 p.m. that day, after receiving a call asking officers to check on his well-being, a police spokesperson said.

The medical examiner‚Äôs office has not released his cause of death, but police officials this week said there is ‚Äúcurrently, no evidence of foul play.‚Äù

Information he held was expected to play a key part in lawsuits against the San Francisco-based company.

Balaji‚Äôs death comes three months after he publicly accused OpenAI of violating U.S. copyright law while developing ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence program that has become a moneymaking sensation used by hundreds of millions of people across the world.

Its public release in late 2022 spurred a torrent of lawsuits against OpenAI from authors, computer programmers and journalists, who say the company illegally stole their copyrighted material to train its program and elevate its value past $150 billion.

The Mercury News and seven sister news outlets are among several newspapers, including the New York Times, to sue OpenAI in the past year.

In an interview with the New York Times published Oct. 23, Balaji argued OpenAI was harming businesses and entrepreneurs whose data were used to train ChatGPT.

‚ÄúIf you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,‚Äù he told the outlet, adding that ‚Äúthis is not a sustainable model for the internet ecosystem as a whole.‚Äù

Balaji grew up in Cupertino before attending UC Berkeley to study computer science. It was then he became a believer in the potential benefits that artificial intelligence could offer society, including its ability to cure diseases and stop aging, the Times reported. ‚ÄúI thought we could invent some kind of scientist that could help solve them,‚Äù he told the newspaper.

But his outlook began to sour in 2022, two years after joining OpenAI as a researcher. He grew particularly concerned about his assignment of gathering data from the internet for the company‚Äôs GPT-4 program, which analyzed text from nearly the entire internet to train its artificial intelligence program, the news outlet reported.

The practice, he told the Times, ran afoul of the country‚Äôs ‚Äúfair use‚Äù laws governing how people can use previously published work. In late October, he posted an analysis on his personal website arguing that point.

No known factors ‚Äúseem to weigh in favor of ChatGPT being a fair use of its training data,‚Äù Balaji wrote. ‚ÄúThat being said, none of the arguments here are fundamentally specific to ChatGPT either, and similar arguments could be made for many generative AI products in a wide variety of domains.‚Äù

Reached by this news agency, Balaji‚Äôs mother requested privacy while grieving the death of her son.

In a Nov. 18 letter filed in federal court, attorneys for The New York Times named Balaji as someone who had ‚Äúunique and relevant documents‚Äù that would support their case against OpenAI. He was among at least 12 people ‚Äî many of them past or present OpenAI employees ‚Äî the newspaper had named in court filings as having material helpful to their case, ahead of depositions.

Generative artificial intelligence programs work by analyzing an immense amount of data from the internet and using it to answer prompts submitted by users, or to create text, images or videos.

When OpenAI released its ChatGPT program in late 2022, it turbocharged an industry of companies seeking to write essays, make art and create computer code. Many of the most valuable companies in the world now work in the field of artificial intelligence, or manufacture the computer chips needed to run those programs. OpenAI‚Äôs own value nearly doubled in the past year.

News outlets have argued that OpenAI and Microsoft ‚Äî which is in business with OpenAI also has been sued by The Mercury News ‚Äî have plagiarized and stole its articles, undermining their business models.

‚ÄúMicrosoft and OpenAI simply take the work product of reporters, journalists, editorial writers, editors and others who contribute to the work of local newspapers ‚Äî all without any regard for the efforts, much less the legal rights, of those who create and publish the news on which local communities rely,‚Äù the newspapers‚Äô lawsuit said.

OpenAI has staunchly refuted those claims, stressing that all of its work remains legal under ‚Äúfair use‚Äù laws.

‚ÄúWe see immense potential for AI tools like ChatGPT to deepen publishers‚Äô relationships with readers and enhance the news experience,‚Äù the company said when the lawsuit was filed.‚Äù",244,1734136743.0,t3_1hdq31l

1hdq31l,m2arkno,JJtheSucculent,"It‚Äôs a very well-written piece of work. My explanation will not do its justice. I‚Äôll try my best and hope other people come up with better answers. 

Copyright laws uses the term ‚Äúfair use‚Äù to allow materials (creative writings) to be used by various entities. When training large language models (generative AI like chatGPT), they use ALL the materials available on the internet. Think of all the possible works ever existed. GEN AI companies like open AI the capitalize on the model they developed based NOT on their own intellectual property, but the totality of human creativity ever existed. Part of that creativity is protected by copyright laws. Open AI (and other LLM developer companies)‚Äôs use of this data (all human generated texts existed) is not fair use of copyright materials, and their products (chatGPT) lead to business losses in the original copyright holders. This also hurts society as a whole because copyright law protects authors, artists to benefit from the work they created. With OPEN AI‚Äôs business model, the creativity from authors and artists are capitalized by the model developer companies, instead of who created the work in the first place. I‚Äôm from social science background, and this leads me to think,as a result, creativity will not be rewarded like before, and we would expect that it may lead to a decline in creative works. It really got us thinking should we really allow technology like this to exist unregulated at all? The answer obviously should be no. The laws and regulations are not catching up. I think that‚Äôs why they fear him. His writing is very concise, logical, and make hard concepts easy to understand. Hope his work leads to real change in regulating AI. My explanations really don‚Äôt do justice to his work. Hope someone do a better version. I‚Äôm also wondering what‚Äôs the avenue to promote real change? We should probably write to our congress person about the message he‚Äôs trying to send, and ask for laws and regulations put in place to protect creative works to prevent giant capital cooperations crushing over the creative individuals in our society who put all their life experiences together to create these works. Would anyone be interested in draft a letter with the message he‚Äôs trying to send?",3,1734334691.0,t1_m2a2zh9

3 whistleblowers who were connected to high-profile lawsuits have died in the past few months, all before they could testify. It's a stretch to call that coincidence.

And you know what? You're right. This is never, ever, **ever** going to see a courtroom. The police investigation's going to rule it as a suicide within a week or two, regardless of whatever dubious circumstances led up to his death, and quietly pack this away in their archives.

Jumping to an elaborate conspiratorial explanation before there‚Äôs evidence for it is the kind of blursed Q kinda thinking which rejects any ordinary tragedy  for an exciting conspiracy.

I don't envy the people that felt so personally victimized by these images that they took time out of their day to make it known on Reddit.

As somebody pointed out, this was technically the African American Studies departmental graduation. It seems that many commenters are upset that students of other majors were allowed to attend this graduation, and that many of these students happened to be Black. There was nothing about this event that endorsed segregation or exclusivity; as one of the speakers said (to a round of applause) ""being pro-Black does not mean being anti- anything else"".

I'm sure if any of you really felt the need to prove a point, you could've signed up to walk in this ceremony and it would've been just fine. As a matter of fact you might've gained a greater appreciation for Black culture and community, cause the ceremony was a blast. For what it's worth, I'm not Black myself but felt nothing but welcomed, loved, and appreciated at this event.

I don't think that's correct.  It's a ceremony specifically to focus on [black graduates](https://ls.berkeley.edu/news/uc-berkeleys-black-graduation-celebrating-community-culture-and-achievement) (undergrad, masters, or PhD).

Octoberfest is a celebration of german culture: not racist. St Patricks Day parades: not racist, or even segregation. The fact that you see more white people at country concerts and black people at rap concerts: also not racist.

In this case what you're seeing is a bunch of community members celebrating the people in their community. The people graduating still walk with their own departments if they want to. They just also throw this party to celebrate how far their community has come, from being not allowed in these institutions to graduating from them.

I am positive that if a white person showed up and was supportive (ie, didn't just show up to troll) they would be accepted in, not kicked out.

Westwood itself is mostly the same boring locations that you're going to find in the rest of the city. House of Mandi (originally from Anaheim) is probably the most exciting new opening and I found the Westwood location to be noticeably worse. Other than that, you have Northern Cafe, Kazunori, Sichuan Impression, Tacos 1986, which are fine-great restaurants, but also just secondary locations of places you can find near other university campuses like UCI (close to Kazunori in Newport Beach, has two Northern Cafes nearby, Sichuan Impression in Tustin) and the rest are your typically university campus mid-end restaurants.

Berkeley's food scene is unique and has a lot more history. While WeHo and Beverly Hills have a much more eclectic food scene, as someone who lives there now, I can say pretty confidently that there aren't that many UCLA students coming over here for dinner. SGV has the best Chinese food in the country but is 40 minute to 2 hour drive from UCLA, and KTown is great but its still a hassle to make the commute. The only big advantage Westwood has is its proximity to Sawtelle for Japanese food.",5,1729931257.0,t1_lts7rpu

For the record, SD has some incredible food and I think La Jolla is slept on in these discussions‚Äîrich people aren‚Äôt just paying for the views.

We go to Berkeley, look at the breakdown! National ranking is undergraduate experience, alongside academics and such. 

Support, resources and area are all taken into account and weight up to ~60% or more percent on the ranking. UCLA has a better environment hands down and the campus is better. It is also a lot more fun in LA

Berkeley ranks consistently ranks in the top of global universities, which is calculated by weighting research, prestige and other factors. UCLA is not in the top 10.

1f8k283,llhq8td,TheKizza77,"You honestly think that having an opinion shared about the objective content of a post is a ""negative vibe""?  Disagreement or criticism is not a negative vibe.  It's the real world, outside of homemade social echo chambers.

The entire post is condescending, lecturing ""you all"" on how shallow and arrogant they are, with snarky little quips like ""crazy news:"" and ""news flash:"".  Yeah, that's a super positive vibe, though, right?

The post *is* insecure.  OP takes numerous opportunities to tell these people he finds so arrogant and offensive that they have it all wrong, and he knows what is really important in life and in the real world.  OP, do you truly believe that, and do you have those attributes which you say are most relevant?  Then you have nothing to worry or complain about.  You're already on the right track and will succeed.  They are jaded by their vanity metrics and will eventually fail.  You're the one winning.  Why would you need to go on a 300+ word rant, if you're the one who is right?  The answer is: you wouldn't.  You're insecure about your own status and are hurt by the fact you feel judged by them.

The post *is* disheveled.  OP drops a ""fucking pretentious"" in the title... which is ironic as hell, since he takes a condescending, insulting tone with his entire message (see above).  Then he proceeds to go on a lowercase, typo filled run-on journey claiming that the people who aren't accepting him are automatically Harvey Weinstein.  A reasonable message would have been to call out what he saw as poor attitudes, and ask people where he might go to find more complementary people or groups.  Not an endless stream of insults that reads like a drunken vent.

OP is trying to join some community that he has determined, up to now, was valuable to join.  Define it as the consulting clubs, maybe Cal itself.  He's not fitting in with this community, and based on his attitude, I'm not surprised.

He has to grow up, and figure out what it is about himself that is not vibing with said community.  If that community really is important to him (which is a huge *IF*), he will have to adapt.  That doesn't mean making up better high school accomplishments.  You adapt with your attitudes, demeanor, and perspectives.  I 100% guarantee these people he's referring to would not actually refuse to talk to him based on how many AP classes he took (or whatever this presumed judgement is based on).  This is all assuming the community he wants so bad is even worth this change.  But whining about the fact that everyone else is wrong and he is right will not get him anywhere at all.  The ""negative vibe"" here is coming from OP, which is plainly clear from this post.

As I implied above - if this community is pretentious, arrogant, and abusive and they have the wrong view of the world in his opinion, then *don't try to join them*.  Why would you want to be with those kind of people?  I would be soundly rejected and possibly assaulted by MAGA.  I am more than fine with that.  Be proud of your decision and create your own path to where you want to be.  You'll find the like-minded people along the way.",-5,1725468694.0,t1_llfe2fg

1ch3tti,l25c9l1,velcrodynamite,"I grew up in the East Bay with a grandpa who was really into sports. His teams were the Giants, the Niners, and the Cal Bears. And since my dad was kind of an absent figure in my life (if not absent, just totally useless), I adored my grandpa to heaven and back; he was my father figure. So, I was like ""if and when I ever go to college, it'll be there"" when I was a kid. Idk, it just kind of always represented the pinnacle of higher ed to me, growing up in its shadow. It's where all the smart kids from my high school went. I was going through too much junk in hs to be grouped with those kids back then, but the desire to prove that I *could* hold my own at a place like Berkeley never went away. 

When transfer apps came around during the pandemic, I applied to 27(?) different schools thanks to app fee waivers and seriously considered quite a few further afield (Vandy, USC, Cornell, Columbia), but Cal's aid was the best of any of them and since I'd be living at home, I would get to keep a decent chunk of that aid and put it away for the future. I have essentially been getting paid to attend here! It started as a little kid desire to make my grandpa proud, but it ended up being the most pragmatic option. My family's been in the Bay for four or five generations (since the late 1860s, actually). They watched this place be built up. It became almost mythic in their minds, but I was the first to actually go here. So, as a weird, unintended result of my graduation, I feel like I'm achieving four or five generations' worth of dreams.

There's a back story to the ""assembly site"" as well.  Originally the Army was planning to have it at a city fire station, in a parking lot I think. People in the First Congregational Church thought that was demeaning, so they offered the social hall at their church, and the Army accepted. The church also organized volunteers from several south campus area churches to bring ""hospitality""--sandwiches, coffee, etc. at the assembly point, each church on a different day, to serve to people who were registering and waiting for the buses. Something the Army probably didn't think of.

Using your buddy Hamas' numbers, if 30K have been killed and then using Israel's numbers 10K are Hamas, then that 3:1 number is well under what happens in most wars and all urban wars.

there is no occupation, Israel left Gaza in 2005. Instead of using that as a time to make an independent state of their own, your friends in Hamas used that as a time to oppress their own citizens, rip up waterworks, destroy industry, and wage terrorist attacks against Israel.

there is no apartheid, 2 million Arabs live as full citizens in Israel, they get healthcare, and they even serve in the army if they want to.

You can easily find dozens of twitter streams of Arab Israelis defending Israel, stating there is no apartheid and calling out you and Hamas and the attackers at fault.

You repeatedly start wars with Israel and Israel repeatedly beats you and when they do, you start crying waaah, someone please make them stop.

There has never been an Arab or Muslim democracy in the middle east, it's just one tyrannical government after another, but you claim that when Israel is wiped into the sea, that the Palestinian gov't will allow Jews to live there peacefully.

3) If Miami has a 4 man rush against 5 offensive lineman and are STILL getting to the QB right after the snap then he‚Äôs only going to have time to potentially throw it to the check down.

Bonus: That was clear targeting which if called correctly would‚Äôve meant a first down for cal.

In the last few minutes of the game, they gather and stand confrontationally in front of each other and stare each other down until the game is over (or if the game is one sided). Then when either Cal or Stanford are ahead clearly and winning the game, the Axe trophy is awarded to the winning team's committee (either it's held or exchanged between schools). The winning committee then runs away and celebrates with their team and students.

Today our Cal Rally Committee brought the axe over, stared down Stanford's committee, and since we won the game, we retained the Axe since we have not lost the Big Game since 2020.

That feeling you describe about your relationship to campus and that magic is almost exactly how I felt and I imagine how most people feel. 

I had that magic all 4 years but my freshman year was peak magic. Towards the end, I focused more on my studies. After graduating, I just had this notion that my friends were no longer on campus and had moved on to their next phase in life. Though the truth was that some of them still had another semester. I just had this notion that I would no longer run into people I knew even though that happened somewhat rarely anyway. 

I also just partied less over time and life transitioned into job interviews, starting my career and adulting. 

From a mental maturity perspective I think that 18-22 phase is a primary period of life exploration where you uniquely have a sense of wonder. You can have first time experiences as an adult and learn so much about the world and people. Your eyes are opened in ways it hasn‚Äôt been before. There‚Äôs a magic in that. 

But as you get older and more focus on your studies or work, life can grow slightly more insular. 

In the immediate period after graduation, I felt like it was time for me to move on.  I suspect you feel that way too. But even in the years after when I was working, I would often visit and even spend time at the old cafes flooded with nostalgia. And every time I visit, I just get that fond feeling of a period in my life when I was much younger and all the special memories that are tied to that place.",40,1724405613.0,t3_1ez4d36

I completely understand. My experience with the PhD process was soul crushing. I almost gave up many times, and I know lots of people that felt similarly.

For me what was helpful was reminding myself that 1) I was there willingly, and could leave if I really wanted to. 2) many of the stresses we put on ourselves are artificial. If you don't get results or grants, life and progress can still move on.

I also attended some support groups for graduate students run by campus. It was a bit like a weekly therapy session. We would just talk about our experiences and discuss how to move forward. I highly reccomend it.

Just start writing your thesis with what you have, and try to figure out what you need or what is missing. Once you have a thesis, you can just apply to jobs. Once you have a job in hand, it's hard for an advisor to keep you any longer.",24,1724393196.0,t1_lji4oaj

He even got got mentioned in herb Caen, SP?  In his daily column in the chronical.   never would have left, but after coming back from graduate school in albany ny, I didn't have a job.

But say she does both and doesn‚Äôt alienate the core democrat base‚Ä¶ she stills faces the fact that the economy for the bulk of the Trump presidency was good. (Even though his current plan of tariffs will probably devastate the rust belt‚Ä¶)

I think the key factor is Latino men and turnout. Latino men voted 55-45 for Trump according to exit poles, a shift of over 15 points from 40-60 for Biden in 2020. First time voters voted 55-45 for Trump.

This idea that democrats always need to outflank republicans in their reactionary platforms is a losing strategy. When you do that you end up with a Hillary Clinton type of candidate, and the American public has made it clear that they reject that type of candidate

That‚Äôs pretty much it. The GOP can adopt populist positions that appeal to their base, because half of it (lower taxes ^for ^the ^rich and less regulation) is stuff their donors want anyways and the other half (restricting abortion and trans rights) are things the donors at worst don‚Äôt give a shit about.

If the dems were to introduce something representing populism it‚Äôd have to be social democratic reform, which their donors very much do not want, so they stay in the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù position of trying to appeal to some imaginary undecided centrist and focusing on the identity politics that (while, in Berkeley at least, we generally agree with) are undeniably not the most effective position for a mass populist mobilization (outside of maybe abortion rights, but I think most dems see securing abortion rights in non-blue states as a lost cause right now).

1gkt26m,lvpbeag,MrsMiterSaw,"Trump got about the same number of votes as 2020.

Harris got 15M less than Biden. Literally the same administration. The same policies. And Trump has gotten even louder, meaner, more fascist and older.

Do people think that 15M Americans didn't bother to vote because of Gaza? Because of inflation we all know was due to covid? Because of a hare-brained tax scene that will cost 95% of people MORE after he implements tarriffs? 

Or could it be that 15M people just couldn't bring themselves to vote for a woman?

Look at every single election going back 65 years. With the single exception of 2020, the candidate with more charisma has won (and like him or not, you cannot argue that Trump has a charisma that works on so many fucking people).

That means Americans vote for the candidate they find more likeable.  And a lot of Americans hate women. It's sad and it's embarrassing. But it's true.

Go on over to /r/BlueCollarWomen and read about how much men in the trades *hate* women. And then ask yourself if you find it surprising that the teamsters president wouldn't endorse Harris (even though they endorsed her with Biden in 2020), because 40% of his members were voting for a man who despises unions.",34,1730898400.0,t3_1gkt26m
1gkt26m,lvqxzzl,_Asparagus_,"Kamala lost massively in women voters -- I understand what you're trying to say but the data says she is much less popular with *women* than Biden was in 2020, so at least compared to 2020 I'm not sure how easy it is to say your point is why dems lost. And I do think Gaza is an issue that that turned a lot of voters away from her. No one fucking thinks what Israel is doing is okay, yet she expressed her commitment for Israel to defend itself -- yeah she tried to balance that with ""sometimes its going too far"" but like she did not clearly indicate that she would attempt to stop the killing of Gazans. And that is an issue a lot of dems, especially young ones, care about intensely and surely hurt her voter turnout. Plus answers she gave to those questions had the most ""bland politician"" response from her sadly. 

But there's still truth to your claim and I think it lies in more how Kamala is held to a much higher standard than Trump. But honestly I think that's because Trump has done so much fucking dumb ass clown shit that there's nothing new to be added to it that actually makes a difference.

Acting in a way a ""reasonable person"" would not act means there's either a mental health problem or potential crime happening.

No reasonable person would be eating off dirty counters, leaving rotting meat out, leave a sink or room in that condition, none of these things are normal reasonable or safe. These are hazards. They are definitely signs of mental illness.  

Your approach is basically pretend it can't possibly be mental illness until someone else more qualified tells you so? Assume the person is actually choosing to do unreasonable things and it's permissable and totally their own fault because you don't want to bring it up?

This does not educate on the symptoms of a particular mental illness nor suggest treatments that can reduce these symptoms.

Eh, that depends on your sampling strategy and whether or not the participants you recruited actually represent that segment of the population. E.g. when it comes to disability research, it's so common for researchers to recruit people who know/take care of disabled people instead of the disabled people themselves. That's why critical disability studies emerged in the first place. It's not just how many you recruit but also who you recruit, how, and why you do it. The sample size is just *one* component of research methods.

This isn‚Äôt a particularly popular opinion in Berkeley circles, but let‚Äôs just call a spade a spade: there‚Äôs almost nothing remotely feasible the United States could do to change the status quo in Palestine by any real degree. ¬†It doesn‚Äôt matter whether our government stops sending them so much military aid (which we won‚Äôt), or the university divests from weapons manufacturers (which it won‚Äôt), or companies pull their research centers out of the area (which they won‚Äôt). As¬†long as Hamas is in power, they will continue to use their own citizens as meat shields while¬†attacking Israel at every opportunity.¬†And as long as Hamas continues to attack Israel at every opportunity, the IDF will continue to respond with the full force of a first-world militia, collateral damage be damned.¬†That‚Äôs the reality of the situation, and it‚Äôs not Joe Biden‚Äôs fault. Our classmates in tents on Sproul are nothing if not well-intentioned, but it takes an an incredibly amount of naivete to think that any US policy could prevent Hamas from committing terrorism or convince Israel to compromise on the defense of its borders.

The situation in Palestine is tragic, but frankly, there are dozens of worldwide and nationwide crises which are more urgent, more dangerous, and far more likely to be affected by US policy or foreign aid. Global climate change, income inequality, and insufficient gun control within our borders all threaten to kill more people than the IDF ever could. And if we‚Äôre just focusing on conflict-related humanitarian crises, the Russia-Ukraine war is approaching a death toll of 500,000, while China has detained over a million Uyghurs in concentration camps over the past few years (I won‚Äôt even mention what‚Äôs happening in Yemen, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Venezuela, or central Africa). And all the while, the vast majority of Americans under 35 are trying to make ends meet in a struggling economy as housing prices, inflation, and interest rates continue to balloon to all-time highs.¬† Keeping all that in mind, it should come as no surprise that most young Americans don‚Äôt¬†choose their favored presidential candidate based solely on their position on an¬†inexorable war on the other side of the planet. I know I don‚Äôt.¬†¬†

¬†Edit:¬†I really didn‚Äôt think that I had to clarify this, but I guess I do. When it comes to foreign policy, there‚Äôs almost nothing the US can do **assuming that we‚Äôre not willing to completely pull our military aid, as doing so would facilitate the destruction of one of our most important allied nations and the ten million people living there, throw away the majority of our foreign aid directives in the Middle East, give a lifeline to a terroristic organization which is currently on the ropes, and risk our diplomatic relationships with every one of our other allies¬†because we think Israel went overboard while defending themselves from terrorists)**‚Äù.

1. I enjoy watching mkbhd's videos on youtube. Do you believe that as a black man who didn't have insider connections or a rich daddy, he would have been as successful as he is today if there was no youtube and he would have to rely on some studio execs and middlemen to get a similar gig in a TV channel? The same goes for all those players in no-name eastern european places making buttloads of money on youtube and twitch. Is empowering people a worthy social cause?

2. Instagram is also a shopping portal. I come from a third world country and many people from my country are selling ethnic stuff across country borders using Instagram. Do you think they would have been as successful without instagram if they had to rely on convincing Walmart/Target execs to feature their merchandise. My wife follows someone on youtube who went from being a housewife to a small business owner. I don't believe for a minute that she would have been able to pull that off without youtube and instagram to help her.

3. How did you think the protests get organized in large swathes of the world? Heck even Berkeley's recent protests are probably getting organized on some social media app.

4. There are elections going on in my country right now. One of the allegations is that the government controls media and is not giving the opposition a fair air-time. What do you think the opposition is using to reach the people on their own terms if the media is really hostile to them?

5. Whatsapp gets shit for spreading misinformation. But it has helped me and millions of other people be in touch with their families across countries without having to pay extortionist prices to telecom companies for the privilege of calling across borders. What's the social value of that?

A worker in whatsapp probably helped millions of people talk to their families just this day alone. Probably saved someone from being jailed by protecting their communication from the government.

The question was about whether someone's profession is useful/not useful based on whether the organization they are working is making a profit.

The same question goes for researchers who are working for pharma companies which are also for profit.

My post about social media was giving some concrete examples of where Social media helps. It does not make any assertions about whether they are doing it altruistically or if they are sharing their revenues fairly. That is a separate and in my opinion pointless discussion as each person has a different standard for what is fair compensation.

And here's some food for thought. Let's say you came up with a brilliant plan to provide healthcare in a way that meets your standard of fair compensation, what do you think your health provider building will be called? It would still be called a hospital and It would still be as useful as all the other hospitals before it i.e. very useful. If you build a great social media app that does only good and has no downsides it would still be a social media app and it would still be built by Engineers.

The fact is that all of these fields, STEM or liberal arts or otherwise, play important civic roles.

It is unfortunate that you exclude yourself and your engineering friends from that benevolent view.  No, it is not ""greedy"" or boring or shallow or detached from human experience that you are studying the formal mechanics of what it means to optimize under abstract constraints and then applying it to a real-world problem with global consequences.

Look around your room.  Look at the *stuff*.  Think about what it took to get that to you.  The computer, sure, but even the most mundane things like the carpet fabric, the plastic socket covers, the wiring in the walls, the little metal brackets on your desk.  Think about how many thousands, likely millions, of miles of travel are represented in your room.  That's what you're learning about.  Things that we don't even think about, because we take for granted the work that makes them possible, but it's work that helps sustain society as we know it.  And the resulting economies of scale and global travel have massive sociopolitical implications - as an immediate example, consider the Houthis' interruption of Suez Canal shipping, and the ramifications that has for global trade.

And that's just the problem you learned about today!

All that went through the window as education curriculum's got more and more concerned with producing people who can ""contribute"" to the line eternally going up and to the right. ""IT MUST GROW"" screams the universe, and so we cut our programs from anything without ""bottom line contribution"" to some future profession or money-making scheme, forgetting the reason we came to learn at all. 

And why is that important then? Well, because philosophy is a way at getting at deep truths. It is the the best tool to help you understand WHAT should you ask. Whereas science is a great toolset to find the answers to a question- a WHY, a HOW, a WHERE and WHEN- but it's not the best approach to determining fundamental questions.

In the same vein, philosophy uninformed by science can become quite detached, or build grand theories on poor foundations. The interplay within the two is what brings about great science, great progress, and ethical application of these thereof.

Hamas has kept the Gazans as their hostages for 18 years, teaching children to grow up as soldiers to die for a land they were told was taken from them before birth. These kids are playing right into Hamas hands, don‚Äôt you think they know all their people are dying, and they refuse to surrender, they want you to SEE dying Gazans and blame Israel; not them. People blame Israel and call it genocide when Hamas builds tunnel networks under every other building and didn‚Äôt put one dime into bomb shelters. They shoot rockets off from refugee centers, they bomb humanitarian crossings. They steal aid from civilians, they steal food trucks. And people want them to get what they want, a ceasefire, so they can go back to oppressing the Gazans, stealing their humanitarian aid and not caring for their water systems or infrastructure. 

I‚Äôve seen interviews with Gazans free from Hamas, and Hamas are an oppressive Islamic - fascist group that murdered a bunch of Gazans when they protested for water and gas in 2021. Nobody knows the real story, they‚Äôre too busy crying about the deaths, and don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs tragic. But it means they‚Äôre not thinking beyond the deaths, and Hamas knows that, so they want dead Gazans, they don‚Äôt want you thinking beyond the simple fact that they‚Äôre dying.

My main concern was that Israel wasn‚Äôt doing enough to not hurt civilians in the process, and the result will be many civilians dying in the pursuit of taking out Hamas. However, I think you make a good point, the high casualty rate could also be attributed to the conditions of the war rather than bad faith from the Israeli government. At the same time, it feels hard to believe that there isn‚Äôt any bad faith from the Israeli government considering how crazy people like Bibi and Ben-Gvir are.

Im not really sure where I stand on the war. Before, I was pretty firmly pro Israel, but I think Bibi has done a lot of stupid and shitty things since that‚Äôs made me lose faith that his government would executive this war properly. At the same time, I still want Hamas removed from power for the good of both Israelis and Palestinians, but I‚Äôm not sure how many civilian casualties are worth it. Saying Bibi is gonna kill half of the Gaza population was a bad way to word it and doesn‚Äôt reflect what I think Bibi is actually aiming for because while I think he‚Äôs nuts I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs *that* nuts, but I do think that there‚Äôs some number of civilian deaths where the benefit of the war (removing Hamas) doesn‚Äôt outweigh the cost (in terms of lost of life and creating permanent animosity amongst the Palestinian populace that, like keeping Hamas alive, would lead to more conflict) and I‚Äôm not sure that Israel will be able to achieve its goal without crossing that line (both because of issues in the IDF and just the general difficulty of removing Hamas).

There's not many routes that have a good chance of getting something done here, but if that's what you're looking for I would suggest contacting state representatives (your state senator and representatives to the state assembly in Sacramento, not the senators and representatives that go to DC), and filing a consumer complaint with the California Attorney General against Parchment.

A lot of the constituent issues that state representatives here in California deal with regard the University of California system, and that might be worth a shot. I believe the attorney general complaint would do is send a letter to Parchment, which could potentially prompt them to look into it and contact the UC about it. Basically what you'd be hoping for either way is a Hail Mary where someone sends some letter that makes some organization involved go ""oh fuck, we messed up"".

Best of luck. That's a terrible situation for someone to be in, and hopefully she'll be able to make something of her year whatever it ends up looking like. As a transfer I believe she should be able to reapply if it does end up having to be an unplanned gap year.",86,1724308328.0,t3_1eyawqx

One thing about this fuck ass school is most people working there don‚Äôt know wtf they‚Äôre doing themselves so you have to find resources to contact yourself, keep calling different offices even if they say no. If you talk to a counselor/advisor and they say one thing, I promise you the next counselor/advisor will say a different thing so try multiple staff at each department. (Also try the advisors at Transfer Center if you haven‚Äôt already).

You have proof that you contacted a counselor and they said not to worry I‚Äôm pretty sure calls get recorded/monitor so Cal has no case here they just fucked you over! My old roomate was in a similar situation and he somehow managed to find a bunch of people who work at the admissions office who make the decisions on LinkedIn and for some he found their email. He then proceeded to message every single one of them on LinkedIn and emailed the ones who he couldn‚Äôt find on LinkedIn and by some miracle one of those people actually ended up helping him resolve his issue and he was able to attend Cal!

NPR's take:

&gt; There were fewer than 300 videos using the hashtag #lettertoamerica that garnered around 2 million views by Wednesday, according to TikTok, a platform with an estimated 1.6 billion monthly active users. For comparison, a recent 24-hour period on the platform had 200 million videos using #GymTok and #travel videos racked up 137 million.
&gt;
&gt;Yet after a tweet on Thursday afternoon from social media influencer Yashar Ali went viral on the platform formerly known as Twitter rounding up some of the videos, the number of views on the #lettertoamerica hashtag jumped to 13 million. That sent TikTok rushing to remove content related to the manifesto. In cracking down on the posts, TikTok even began suppressing videos that were criticizing those who were endorsing bin Laden's hateful writing.

The First Amendment is not absolute, it needs to be balanced with other rights (and civil liberties) namely for instance Title VI which says students must be able to meaningfully participate in their education and cannot face intimidation, harassment, etc. severe enough to keep them from that.

The problem is we need Israel to stay armed to the teeth because of Syria and Iran.

Any perceived weakness and I am afraid they (or their proxies, in Irans case) will jump at it.

Personally I think we could strike a deal with Israel along the lines of:

- cut funding for UNRWA and transfer it to UNHCR. It has been known for years now that UNRWA curriculums are filled with racism and hatred
- cut support to Gaza to a minium with increases only based step-by-step on verifiable actions: hostages returned, Gazans sending the terrorists to international custody and finally the democratic elections being held in Gaza
- international forces control Gaza until then

Seriously: what Israel want is to make sure 07.10 doesn't happen again.

They approach this in a heavy handed way (although still much gentler than US response to the September 11th attacks or our collective response to nazi Germany) but their goals are clear:

- make sure Israelis can live safely within their borders.

Gay Liberation Theory supports a regime that prevents free speech, due process, equal protection and that literally tortures and kills dissenters? And that's long before looking to make homosexual acts legal or legalize gay marriage.

That's just asinine. It truly reveals the Judith Butlers to be the idiot assholes they are.

Fun things for an 11 year old is to see the view from the top of the Campanile ($5 per person), see a cast of a T-Rex skeleton inside Valley Life Sciences Building (enter from the north), stop at Maxwell Field before the game for the pre-game festivities, and/or see the pep-rally at Sproul Plaza usually an hour and a half before kickoff (the band will post the time on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/calband/)) and walk up to the stadium with the band playing. The [tours of campus](https://visit.berkeley.edu/campus-tours/free-guided-walking-tours) are also pretty interesting with a lot of cool trivia, and definitely a must see for someone thinking of attending Cal (though that day seems to be fully booked).

ESPN's College Gameday is coming to campus for the first time and those are always a crazy frenzy. But they record it from 6am-9am PT, so if you're going to the game it would make for an insanely long day.",11,1727584321.0,t1_lpfr79p

Parking is very difficult, as others have said. Easiest option is to park at Ashby or North Berkeley Bart and then ride 1 stop to Downtown Berkeley. You then have to walk up the hill to Memorial through campus, which is sort of a right of passage.

A person born with no genitalia or multiple genitalia is called intersex, sometimes the presence of ovarian tissue and testicular tissue can be present. This is a rare DISORDER. It is not a third sex or several. Thats like saying if a child was born with three legs you suddenly don‚Äôt know how many legs humans are supposed to have.
The answer is still two, everything else is an abnormality. ü§Ø I‚Äôm sure that went over your head‚Ä¶

Also, doctors determine what the sex of the child was supposed to be through hormonal, genetic, and radiological testing. This is necessary before performing CORRECTIONAL surgery. Yes, that is what it is called. It is possible for an intersex person to develop hormonal irregularities during puberty but they are still not some made up gender identity they came up with last night to stroke their ego working at Cheeseboard.

And guess what? There‚Äôs no such thing as hermaphroditism in humans, no intersex person has ever been able to have both functional sex organs even if tissue of both organs has been seen present, it is a physiological impossibility.

So, while some intersex individuals may have both or no genitalia, the scenario of a ‚Äú hermaphrodite‚Äù with fully functional dual reproductive systems does not exist. You know why? Because we‚Äôre mammals not lizards, we have two sexual roles for reproduction; that is the undisputed biological reason why gender even exists. 

You‚Äôre no different than flat earthers. You are presented with facts but you always try to spin something in an absurd manner to push your narrative. Maybe stop getting your medical knowledge from tv shows? üòÜ",1,1725225916.0,t1_lky2i20

It's not an offense for someone to guess based on appearance when they meet you. It IS rude if they continue to do so once corrected. I see a lot of people in this thread saying the OOP is a snowflake for getting upset about it, while disagreeing that someone who gets upset someone called them the wrong pronoun ONCE when not even directly talking to them before being corrected is also a snowflake.

Young men are more likely to be conservative than they were a a few years ago, and some of them vote and can be radicalized towards violence against other people, and the rights violence tends to be lot worse then tomatoes.

1gelcdg,lue0j4r,EvilMoSauron,"Alright, there's blame on both sides, but for different reasons.

Turning Point (the Converatives) were shilling their crap in the most historically left leaning college in America. They knew and were hoping to piss people off and benefit from the propaganda while framing the ""Tolerant Left"" to be intolerant.

The activist is in the wrong for vandalizing the property of the conservatives. A better way is to verbally protest, silent protest, report to staff, report to media, or occupy in front of their display. You don't want to give these uneducated Christofascists more ammo than they already use.

Conclusion: The signs the conservatives had on display were anti-Trans rights. Trans people have the right to live, end of story. They're people who just want to live their lives in a body they feel comfortable in. Conservatives who demonize trans people will make unfalsifiable claims and rationalize their way out of a maze of logical fallacies to get the ""proof"" that their predetermined claims were correct the whole time. It's asinine, apathetic, and extremely ignorant.

There comes a point where tolerance tolerates the intolerant. Historically, intolerance causes racism, hate, genocide, war, paranoia, mass hysteria, mob rule, social divisions, and fascism. These are signs that a society is failing and needs to be reformed.

Even though it's a contradiction of words, it holds a clue to follow: societies end when the tolerance tolerates intolerance. Therefore, in order to stabilize a society, the intolerance of others must be addressed with education, diversity, and exposure. I'm not advocating for violence, I don't want people to die over ignorance while easy alternatives are available. Unfortunately, whoever casts the first stone, I will gladly die to defend another's freedoms and equal rights.

1gbf5hs,lttaqzm,This-Ad2321,"Hmm, this is a dumb angle because all I have to do is, to put at as you have, ‚Äúdo shit.‚Äù Which I will now do.
1. Autism and trans identity are two completely different things with different expressed traits and experiences. This statement is obviously false, hateful to both autistic and trans people, and designed to provoke.
2. Sure, it‚Äôs okay to be white. It‚Äôs not okay to leverage your whiteness to oppress others. That‚Äôs what people have issues with. This is a dogwhistle designed to legitimize white supremacy. This statement is hateful and designed to provoke.
3. Yes there are. If they‚Äôre talking about sexual characteristics, intersex people exist and there‚Äôs nothing medically wrong with them, they are healthy the way they were born. With regards to gender expression, if someone doesn‚Äôt feel like the majority of male or female social characteristics overlaps with their social characteristics, they are non-binary. This is just language, you cannot ‚Äúdisprove‚Äù it because the language and mechanisms of proof just doesn‚Äôt make sense in this context. This statement is false, hateful to non-binary people, and designed to provoke.
4. You can‚Äôt say no to black privilege because it doesn‚Äôt exist. Black people face extremely disproportionate social, economic, and legal hardships because of racism. This statement is most likely in reference to affirmative action, which besides being a socioeconomically *corrective* policy, not a discriminatory policy, predominately benefits white women anyway, making the issue of black people stealing jobs from more qualified white people about as real an issue as election fraud, (ie nonexistent and a mechanism for conservative gaslighting. If you think otherwise, I‚Äôm sorry, there‚Äôs no nice way to put this, but you‚Äôre not a very intelligent person). This statement is false, hateful to black people, and designed to provoke.
5. Of course black lives matter. To say that an entire group of people is not worth living is essentially the most hateful thing someone can believe. If you think this, you are evil, and if you question this, you are also evil, and you have no right to participate in a just society. This statement is hateful to black people and designed to provoke.
6. If Democrats are the real fascists then why did Republicans storm the capital and chant to gas the Jews in Charlottesville. Trump‚Äôs immigration, racial, and foreign policy is the textbook definition of fascist, and he has literally said he wishes he had generals like Hitler‚Äôs. Democrats do not seek to create a racially homogenous state through the systematic targeting of vulnerable groups. There is abundant evidence that Democrats are not fascists, and even more abundant evidence that the GOP is. This statement is hateful and designed to provoke.

**PART 1/3**

Nearly three years ago, Stanford‚Äôs Institute for Diversity in the Arts, accompanied by a message wishing viewers a ‚ÄúHappy Indigenous People‚Äôs Day!‚Äù shared on its [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=Y_KAV9YaKhZCoW-d&amp;v=Ltj9hMVwnRE&amp;feature=youtu.be) a 2019 lecture given by Elizabeth Hoover, then a Stanford fellow teaching at Brown University.

‚ÄúShe: kon (hello, pronounced saygo). Skennen‚Äôk√≥: wa (great peace ‚Äî skanadoga),‚Äù Hoover solemnly intoned in Mohawk. ‚ÄúMy background is Kahnaw√†: ke (formerly Caughnawaga, pronounced Ganawhaga) or Mohawk and Mi‚Äôkmaq (pronounced Miguma) from the northeastern part of what is now the United States and southeastern Canada.‚Äù

Attired in the latest dress from Crow fashion designer Bethany Yellowtail and wearing beautifully embroidered boots and large Native American earrings, Hoover‚Äôs dark brown hair, bright inquisitive eyes, tan skin and slim figure helped her look younger than her 41 years. She proceeded to give a talk describing decades of work by Mohawk women to document the effect of St. Lawrence Seaway pollution on their bodies, breastmilk, children and traditional foods. 

With her media savvy and impressive academic pedigree, Hoover used appearances like this to become a celebrity of sorts in the realm of Native American academia. Best known for her 2017 book, ‚ÄúThe River Is in Us: Fighting Toxics in a Mohawk Community,‚Äù an ethnographic study of the 40-year struggle for environmental justice by Mohawk women on the Akwesasne reservation that straddles the Canadian border, her reputation as a Native researcher helped her gain entry to spaces that other, more experienced academics were denied.

In her doctoral thesis at Brown on ‚Äúrelational accountability‚Äù ‚Äî a term to describe when a researcher uses clear and honest communication with an indigenous subject or group to gain access to their knowledge and experiences ‚Äî Hoover noted that she was allowed the special privilege of participating in Longhouse ceremonies and assisting with the coming of age ceremonies for girls. ‚ÄúBecause I am of Mohawk and Mi‚Äôkmaq descent, (my mother has ancestors from Kahnawake, a Mohawk community to the east of Akwesasne, and my father has Mi‚Äôkmaq ancestors from Quebec), I was invited to attend Longhouse events.‚Äù

These are normally closed to non-Natives because of, as Hoover described it, ‚Äúacquired distrust that Mohawks have for academics at their ceremonies.‚Äù

That concern would prove warranted, and Hoover would arguably be the one to violate it most egregiously ‚Äî because she isn‚Äôt Native at all.

On May 1, 2023, Hoover posted a mea culpa on her website, declaring herself a white woman who mistakenly built a career on being of Mohawk and Mi‚Äôkmaq descent. Titled ‚Äú[Letter of Apology and Accountability](https://www.profelizabethmhoover.com/identity),‚Äù her confession claimed that she had ‚Äúuncritically liv(ed) an identity based on family stories without seeking out a documented connection to these communities,‚Äù and only recently became aware of questions regarding the authenticity of her identity. She noted that while many Native scholars had questioned the veracity of her tribal claims for years, she dismissed these doubts as ‚Äújealousy‚Äù by other less accomplished American Indians. Now she was finally coming clean. 

Native graduate students at UC Berkeley, where she is an associate professor with a specialty in Native food systems, put together a list of demands for accountability that garnered over 300 signatories. One of these demands was that Hoover resign from her position and put herself back on the market as a white woman.

Yet a year later, despite her admission that ‚Äúidentifying as a Native person gave me access to spaces and resources that I would not have otherwise, resources that were intended for students of color,‚Äù Hoover has not resigned, and has not indicated that she intends to. Nor has the university suggested that it will force her to do so.

Instead, both UC Berkeley and Hoover are riding out the storm, as is Brown University, where Hoover built her career.

Hoover has promised to donate some of the proceeds of her book ‚Äî which currently retails for $112 for a library-bound copy ‚Äî to support Native efforts at self-determination. However, the University of Minnesota Press, the book‚Äôs publisher, told me in an email that the book went out of print on March 24.

Many Native American scholars and community members, of course, have questioned the improbability that someone with a doctorate in anthropology would not have been able to ascertain her lack of Native ancestry before building a career on it. 

University administrations, however, appear content to lean on Hoover‚Äôs dubious explanation that this was an innocent mistake born of misguided family lore, even as a recent [New Yorker investigation](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/04/a-professor-claimed-to-be-native-american-did-she-know-she-wasnt) credibly questioned whether Hoover actively knew she was misrepresenting her claims to Mohawk and Mi‚Äôkwaq identity for professional gain. The magazine reported that Hoover claimed she never meaningfully researched her genealogy, telling reporter Jay Caspian Kang that because she knew she would be ineligible for tribal enrollment, she never bothered.

The excuse that Hoover was so immersed in her pursuit of access that she failed to interrogate her heritage is nearly as offensive as if she had lied. If her story is to be believed, a doctorate holder in anthropology penetrated and profited from sacred ceremonies while failing to do even the most basic due diligence.

Despite this, Janet Gilmore, senior director of strategic communications for UC Berkeley, told me via email that the dean of Hoover‚Äôs college, Rausser College of Natural Resources, David Ackerly refused to comment on whether the university planned to even launch an investigation.

Of course, the idea that U.S. American Indian tribal identity is ‚Äú[too complex](https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Sacheen-Littlefeather-Pretendians-17602244.php)‚Äù to prove, even by people using the claim professionally, has been in vogue in academia and other fields like publishing and Hollywood for decades. This has left an enormous opening for con artists to exploit.

And they do. [Particularly in academia.](https://www.voanews.com/a/native-first-nations-scholars-fake-indians-prevalent-in-higher-education-/6511681.html)

Former UC Riverside Native Studies professor Andrea Smith, for example, was once lauded by her dissertation adviser Angela Davis ‚Äúone of the greatest Indigenous feminist intellectuals of our time.‚Äù Smith had claimed to be Cherokee, but research into her family tree that found no Native lineage [spurred 13 of her faculty colleagues](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/magazine/cherokee-native-american-andrea-smith.html) into filing charges that she violated academic integrity.

The university ultimately agreed to a separation agreement with Smith, avoiding a costly investigation of the allegations against her and allowing her to retire early with full benefits.

  ‚ÄúOur administration basically ‚Äòpunted‚Äô and left it to a few faculty to file charges,‚Äù one of the 13 faculty members explained to me. ‚ÄúI got no joy from having to get involved with the whole thing. However, the (reporters covering the story) chose to emphasize the conflict of the situation and not the pain it caused.‚Äù",65,1714936015.0,t3_1ckykqm
1ckykqm,l2q540p,TheRealPeteWheeler,"**PART 2/3**

So how does someone like Hoover with no Native ties get away with using a false heritage to infiltrate some of the most rarefied professional spaces in America? And who pays the price when they do?

In Hoover‚Äôs case, the answers to these questions are shocking and yet somehow unsurprising.

Doug George is a Mohawk elder from Akwesasne, the tribe Hoover claimed descendence from. He described to me the way someone who has lost their ties to the community traditionally broaches a reentry.

‚ÄúThe preference is for subtlety and patience,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWait at the edge of the territory, light a fire and then people see the smoke and they approach you and they bring you into the community.‚Äù

Instead of immediately absorbing his people‚Äôs cultural norms and traditional teachings, George said people should fully learn their familial connection and demonstrate that connection to community members. Family is the root everything else is grafted to.

That was not how Hoover did things.

He said that when she arrived in their community no one could find her family at Akwesasne or Kahnawake, despite those communities being quite small. Doubt arose, yet some backed her up and let her into the Longhouse, a sacred space generally not open to outsiders. There, she witnessed cultural ceremonies she would not have had access to without her false claims.

Hoover generally declined to participate in this story, but she did say in an email statement: ‚ÄúDespite false assertions made by some people in the media recently, my story about my family never changed ‚Äî I have always shared the same story about my family that my parents shared with me.‚Äù

One thing that‚Äôs not in dispute is that the information Hoover gathered in Awkwesasne bestowed an authenticity upon her that opened doors.

When Devon Mihesuah, a Choctaw professor at the University of Kansas and an accomplished author of more than 20 books, went looking for a co-editor for her book ‚ÄúIndigenous Food Sovereignty,‚Äù she asked the relatively inexperienced Hoover to co-edit.

In that book, Hoover reasserted her Mohawk claims, writing: ‚ÄúOur mountains were adjacent to the Mohawk Valley, the original home of some of my mother‚Äôs Mohawk ancestors before settlers pushed them north.‚Äù

Yet as the book neared publication, Mihesuah found herself studying a new promotional flyer the publisher sent her ‚Äî which included changes requested by Hoover. At first, Mihesuah couldn‚Äôt spot any actual changes. Finally, she told me in an interview, she realized Hoover had removed all claims to a tribal identity, which Hoover didn‚Äôt deny to the New Yorker.

Mihesuah was ultimately robbed of enjoying the book‚Äôs success once she realized her co-editor‚Äôs tribal claims were suspect. She is now speaking to her publisher about removing Hoover from the book in future editions.

When the book was first published, however, it made Hoover a hot commodity, according to a UC Berkeley faculty member in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management who participated in Hoover‚Äôs hiring and wishes to be unnamed over fear of reprisal. ‚ÄúIt was an open search, and she did rise to the top.‚Äù

Contrary to some reports, Hoover was not a ‚Äúcluster hire,‚Äù the faculty member said, which is when several new faculty members identified as members of a minority or historically disadvantaged groups are brought aboard simultaneously ‚Äî a method has been championed at UC Berkeley to make ‚Äúan immediate and substantial impact far greater than a few isolated hires.‚Äù That said, ‚ÄúShe took this job as an Indigenous person,‚Äù the faculty member told me. ‚ÄúWe never asked her ‚Äî never hired her because of her identity, but we assumed because of her identity.‚Äù

Another faculty member involved in the hiring process told me Hoover ‚Äúwas one of five or six candidates. She did a great job. Her scholarship was super competitive.‚Äù

When asked how competitive Hoover‚Äôs scholarship was if you took her professed identity out of the equation, however, the faculty member said that increasing diverse perspectives in the department was also a factor that weighed into the final decision.

The faculty members I spoke with said no enrolled Native American candidates made it to the top of the pool with Hoover. Berkeley thus found itself in a bidding war for the young ‚ÄúNative‚Äù academic, as Brown University raised its offer to keep her at the Ivy League school. 

As a result, said one Berkeley faculty member, Hoover makes far more per year [than most associate professors](https://apo.berkeley.edu/compensation/2020-21-academic-salary-scale-revisions). According to [Transparent California](https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2021/university-of-california/elizabeth-hoover/), a searchable database maintained by the Nevada Policy Research Institute, in 2021, Hoover made $165,817 in regular pay and $31,840 in ‚Äúother pay.‚Äù

::

Last year, after Hoover‚Äôs initial statement about her lack of Native ancestry, University of Alberta professor Kim TallBear, a Sisseton-Wahpeton tribal citizen and a former assistant professor at UC Berkeley, wrote in a now-deleted tweet: ‚ÄúWhile I very much appreciated my Society &amp; Environment colleagues, UCB as a whole was a difficult place for me as an actual Native person. Incredibly erasing environment. It‚Äôs a major reason I left.‚Äù

In an email, TallBear reiterated to me her disappointment with her former department, where she taught from 2008-2013, and its leadership for not seriously sanctioning Hoover. ‚ÄúTheir weak response so far is in keeping with the broader Native tokenism and erasure I experienced when I was at Berkeley.‚Äù

She also noted that she was grateful to be teaching in Canada now, even though her tribes, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota in South Dakota, and the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of Oklahoma, are in the United States.

‚ÄúUnlike at Berkeley and many other U.S. institutions, Indigenous demands and pushback against pretendianism is not so easy to ignore at (Canadian) universities,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAt my university and in others, we are already deep into discussing policies for going beyond Indigenous self-identification in admissions and hiring. This is difficult ethical, bureaucratic and legal work. Systemic change in institutions to slow the onslaught of identity fraud will take time, even once we get started having difficult conversations.‚Äù 

This conversation, she said, has yet to meaningfully begin at U.S. universities.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve seen in U.S. universities so far is widespread denial that Indigenous identity fraud and resource appropriation from the poorest demographic in the country is a problem.‚Äù",29,1714936045.0,t1_l2q5188
1ckykqm,l2q55el,TheRealPeteWheeler,"**PART 3/3**

UC Berkeley isn‚Äôt the only institution that boosted Hoover‚Äôs career with a failure of due diligence. She did her doctoral research at Brown University, where an institutional review board, a research ethics committee, would have approved the parameters of Hoover‚Äôs work with the Mohawk community. This committee would have been responsible for reviewing her work again once completed and determining if she committed fraud by introducing herself to the community as of Mohawk descent. Instead, they effectively rubber-stamped her identity, which is deeply problematic given the sacred nature of the ceremonies Hoover partook in as part of this research.

A-dae Romero-Briones, Cochiti/Kiowa, is the director of programs at First Nations Development Institute and has worked in Hoover‚Äôs field of study, Native food systems, for over 20 years. She told me that the importance of fighting for Native foods goes far beyond gardening, cookbooks or academic turf.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a story of loss and reconnections, all the things that go into a healthy food system, water, intergenerational connection. People are trying to reclaim not only land and water but the knowledge that includes food systems.‚Äù

She noted that Native play actors sometimes advocate in ways that are not in accord with the legal needs of the times. And as they are not accountable to these ‚Äúdomestic dependent nations‚Äù (as pre-existing Native nations are described in U.S. constitutional law), they claim to represent.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt even fully accounted the damage that has occurred just yet,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBecause the damage hasn‚Äôt been fully expressed or accounted for yet.‚Äù

Founded in 1980, the First Nations Development Institute has dispersed $55 million in grants to Indigenous communities in the United States and U.S. territories like American Samoa. Unlike American universities, the institute has a reputation for being careful in its granting process to prioritize authentic Native projects.

So how do they do it?

‚ÄúWe do ask for tribal affiliation, and we primarily fund in rural communities so the Native-led nonprofit has to be connected somehow to the community,‚Äù Briones explained. ‚ÄúOur policy is that 51% of the board has a tribal affiliation and connection to the community served.‚Äù

Despite this commitment to diligence, however, the organization published some of Hoover‚Äôs photographs in its cookbook, ‚ÄúCooking Healthier with FDPIR Foods‚Äù ‚Äî demonstrating the difficulty of preventing identity fraud even for those who are rigorous. Universities like Berkeley that fail to develop meaningful checks and balances against pretendianism have almost no chance of weeding out fakes.

Academic institutions have regularly cited Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which makes it illegal to discriminate against someone based on race, color, religion, national origin or sex as a reason not to confirm claims of American Indian identity. However, tribes are exempt from Title VII under the [Indian exception amendment](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/policy-statement-indian-preference-under-title-vii) if the preference for American Indian hires occurs on or near a reservation. Some land grant universities like Michigan State interpret this as reservations within commuting distance. UC Berkeley meets this interpretation, but it‚Äôs unclear how the university regards Title VII.

Hoover continues to teach at UC Berkeley and to be involved in Native communities and their environmental practices. In 2021, she took part in a controlled burn conducted by the Miwok, North Fork Mono and Chukchansi tribes in Northern California. Native scholars have expressed concern over this and pointed out that a couple of her UC Berkeley colleagues already specialize in this field. She recently changed her Facebook background photo to depict a prescribed burn.

::

‚ÄúThe Return of the Native‚Äù is not only the title of a book, the very phrase evokes someone lost finding that warm place ‚Äî a Longhouse with its fire burning and the people inside together.

Hoover was almost there, and then it fell from her grasp. The truth intruded. The Ph.D who claimed she was unable or unwilling to do basic genealogy research was forced to embrace her real European settler ancestors. She promised restitution but none seems forthcoming.

Meanwhile, a bigger question looms: Can white-dominant institutions find a place for real Native Americans? Or will they continue to hold their shiny redface objects close?

She moved back to Berkeley, CA and lived in a few areas around Berkeley. Her parents divorced, and she primarily lived with her mother.

Growing up with two households, she wouldn't have had a significantly wealthy family. She moved to Montreal at 12 and then came back to the US for college.

She was raised by divorced parents in areas that were, even then, relatively expensive.

She grew up middle class. Her parents may have been able to be an upper class household had they been married but they weren't. She moved around a lot and lived in rentals for the most part.

I'd just add that for the first five years or so of Kamala's life, her father was working his way up the academic ladder as an assistant, then associate, professor in the Midwest, while her mother was apparently working as a researcher at the same universities. 

So they would have been double income, but on faculty / research salaries of the 1960s, so not necessarily well to do. And also having some childcare costs, probably. If one asked any assistant professor at Cal today if they were financially well-to-do on their academic income they would definitely say no, just making more than they were as grad students or post-docs, and finally in a pension plan. 

Once her parents separated, then divorced, her father presumably paid child support (and was earning a full professor salary at Stanford) and her mother had a decent career research job at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, so their overall financial condition would have been decently comfortable, but not lavish.

All of those most likely would have supported him for a year or more to do research, probably giving him a basic stipend for living costs, as well as travel money for research projects. 

I don't know exactly on tuition, but I think it was probably negligible in the 70s at Cal, and most graduate students would receive some sort of financial assistance from their academic departments as well.

1gkfmml,lvnxenx,OppositeShore1878,"*Two highly paid college professors who have multiple homes and takes vacations in different countries every year had never been a middle class family...*

You're mistaken. Donald Harris was an assistant, then an associate, professor starting in 1965, entry level tenure track positions. He didn't have a secure full professorship until he was at Stanford, and that was after he and Shyamala Harris separated. 

I would doubt that by standards both then and now, he was ever considered ""highly paid"" until he was well into his Stanford position. 

Shyamala Harris was never a professor, ""highly paid"" or not. She had various research jobs and you don't typically grow rich holding research positions. 

They never had ""multiple homes"". Not sure where you're getting that from? Perhaps you can clarify? They lived in a succession of homes. We know about the Berkeley homes, all of them pretty basic apartments. We know about the Wisconsin home, a basic two bedroom house which they probably rented.  

Donald Harris ended up living in Palo Alto, and, I think, buying a home there in the 80s a decade or more before prices started to go up dramatically in that part of the Bay Area with the early tech boom. Shyamala Harris rented two pretty basic apartments in Berkeley during a six year period, then rented an apartment in Montreal. She didn't / apparently couldn't buy her first house until she returned to the Bay Area in middle age. 

Their ""vacations in different countries every year"" that you imagine were not Club Med trips. Judging from the nature of the research fellowships he got, Donald Harris probably traveled pretty frugally on research grants. He did take his daughters to visit family in rural (not tourist) Jamaica which was a very low cost place to stay, especially if you have relatives to stay with for free. Shyamala Harris took her daughters to visit her family in India--same situation.",1,1730875419.0,t1_lvnudoy

My guess would be that demonstration she alluded to probably occurred in the Midwest, possibly at Northwestern or in the Chicago area, or possibly at Madison, Wisconsin, which was as active a Sixties protest college town as Berkeley.

1gkfmml,lvlhsye,DangerousCyclone,"No. Originally there was the College of California or Contra Costa Academy which was a small religious school in Oakland. It wanted to move out of Oakland, as it was getting to be a bit too big of a city for a religious school, and bought a bunch of farmland to the north to build a new campus. At the same time, the US government had passed the Land Grant Act to create new Colleges and the Californian government got a bunch of money to create a school. The College of California was strapped for cash, so there was this situation where you had a complete College with no money and a College system with money but no school. So they decided to do a sort of merger, though it's often meant to be clear that it wasn't, where the College of California became the University of California in 1868. While the infrastructure remained the same, the board was now appointed by the State Government, which they tried to make it clear it wasn't a mere continuation but a brand new thing. The farmland they bought to the north was used to build the Berkeley campus, however they still operated in the original Oakland campus until 1873. The original school was demolished and appears to just be the site of Apartment buildings.",1,1730843828.0,t1_lvl07ew

We‚Äôre hosting our first beginner sessions this week, where we provide instruction to anyone who‚Äôs interested in learning archery up at the Clark Kerr softball field. More importantly, it‚Äôs FREE AND THERES NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY (or expected, in fact, we actively encourage people with no prior experience because it means you have no bad habits). We provide all the equipment, all the instruction, and all the help, and in fact you don‚Äôt even need friends, because we provide those too!

If you decide the beginner sessions are right for you, we also teach ASCENT, which is an 8 week course where we get interested people spun up on the variety of disciplines we compete in as well as the intricacies and etiquette for competition because (however you will have to pay club dues in order to continue attending ASCENT after the 2nd session):

We also compete both all over the state and Bay Area and across the nation, like in Vegas and Georgia.

The other people trying to get in are people who want to be rich and want connections.

So, my perception is that it's naturally going to be a super elitist, gate-keepey, and gross community where all that really matters is being in, and the main way to be in is to be rich. And then everyone else gets to dance and beg.",34,1725915957.0,t1_lmbvmy7

1gnlvc0,lwg4aqo,Productgeek2014,"Hi, I‚Äôm an alum and it‚Äôs been nearly 11 years since I graduated. When I was on campus, I had my financial aid taken away because my parents hardly made above the line to qualify. I couldn‚Äôt take loans so for that reason, I worked 3 campus jobs (at the same time). I agonized over how expensive books and readers were. I only had enough money by the end of the month to pay rent and the electricity. It was a super exhausting and stressful time. Because of this experience, I got involved with the basic needs center on campus and helped make it a resource for students like us. It‚Äôs a great place to go to build community and access high quality food. It will ease some of the burden on you. 

Fast forward many years, and I work in tech in product management and by the grace of god, I‚Äôve done well for myself. My experience is very much informed by those early years of being surrounded by friends who didn‚Äôt have to think about money, while I hustled from one side of campus to the next to make it from my job to my class. That hustle and drive has led me to a lot of success, where I can comfortably provide for my child, furnish my home, live in the Bay Area, take fun vacations, and build my own company.

If you can spend the 5k on yourself, you likely already have a decent amount of household wealth, with tuition/rent/etc. not being a financial burden.

I'm not devaluing the work put into making that money, and I'm not shaming folks for spending the money they've earned. The reality is that being able to spend the money you've earned on non-essentials like travel implies that essentials are not a concern for you. Most students aren't RAs or TAs.

But I was really talking about students who have money to spend regardless of their working status, which would be most of the student population. The majority of students here come from well-off backgrounds, relative to the US population average.

Edit: And I'm also speaking in generalizations.

STEM textbooks were $50 each, 4 classes/qtr typical load.  So one quarter's tuition and books was about 6 weeks of 40 hrs/wk, after taxes.  That's not including my day to day expenses, so it took me two years of full time work to save $5k.  Today beans cost $2.50/can or about 8X, and minimum wage is about $16.50, or roughly 8X as well.

I enjoy a good guessing game, so here are my guesses for what your items cost (other than wine and bagged items):

Tillamook butter, $9;
Small ass thing of kimchi from a non-asian grocery store, $13;
Chicken, $11;
Salsa, $7;
Flour tortillas, $8;
Pepper jack cheese, $10;
Organic olive oil, $9;
Canned items, $17.

$110 goes a longer way when you shop smarter by going to Asian/Hispanic grocery stores and TJs lol.",2,1729806569.0,t3_1gat6uk

Tortillas are cheaper elsewhere. That brand of salsa is always expensive. Go to Mi Pueblo or another store or make your own.  Canned beans are usually $1-$1.50 at Trader Joe‚Äôs (or you can buy a bag and make your own for much less than canned).  Chicken is cheaper and better elsewhere.

We need updated answers each year. For example, UGBA 10 no longer exists, and the new course is UGBA 10X with a change in curriculum and a cap on enrollment that was half of what it was before. All the previous threads on the course are now mostly obsolete as a result",18,1723836271.0,t1_lifmvnw

Yes. Or there's a new instructor for that course who was TERRIBLE last semester. Or, in the past six months the competent manager of that particular apartment complex left, there's an incompetent manager now, and they increased the rent and the wi-fi doesn't work.

In those cases though I don't downvote, I just scroll by.  

But many of the questions are not necessarily answered in recent posts, and circumstances may have changed since older posts on the same topic. For example, finding a post on RSF hours from last semester or last year may be obsolete / out of date because of changed policies. 

I try to look at the newcomer questions benignly. These are people who are moving to a new and strange place (as most of us did). Sometimes it could be the first major move in their life. It's typically the first time they've lived away from home, on their own. For many this will be the first time they've lived in a city, as opposed to a suburb, and the first time they've lived in the same room / building with strangers for an extended period of time. A lot of them may have never shared a bedroom with anyone.

But Paris does have great urban form and the kind of density you need for quality transit and walkable neighborhoods. The Bay area should try to emulate it in more places.

1ctk0zn,l4j4n2k,WheelyCool,"Yeah but that's complicated. That's just building on the existing ADU laws (which themselves have led to a good amount of construction) plus split lots (which is itself a headache). You'd need to do 4 detached buildings, or at least two duplexes, which are more expensive per unit than a conventional apartment building but wouldn't rent for *that much more* than an apartment.

So, the economics of housing development makes it so you'll have properties where a split lot with 4 total units (whether all detached or a couple duplexes) wouldn't be economical, but putting in a 6 story, 24 unit point-access-block apartment would pencil out and get built. So that's the difference between the status quo (1 SFH plus maybe an ADU) vs 24 homes, all because the new laws weren't sufficient to spur development. That's certainly not a reason to oppose the kind of zoning changes that would lead to more housing actually being built.

Edit: meanwhile adding density in commercial corridors, as you said, is going well because that's where real density is legal. You'd get a ton more apartment construction near University, for example, if it was legal to build apartment complexes within a few blocks of it instead of directly facing the street only. And it's a health and justice issue for renters when we put most new apartments on loud, polluting thoroughfares (because that's the main place where apartments are allowed).",1,1715990033.0,t1_l4j2qqy

But the focus on preserving low density neighborhoods as the thing that defines a city's character just kills housing supply and leads to the ridiculous rents and home prices we get in the Bay (and in places like Berkeley especially).

That focus is still doing harm. For example, the North Berkeley BART station redevelopment was originally proposed as up to 12 floors which would have been GREAT given its location, but neighbors fought so it's a mix of 4-to-8 story buildings...

I  don't think it's unreasonable to consider motive in evaluating research. That said, the authors here took multiple cuts at the data in what appears to be a good faith attempt to negate the basic theory. Something they were largely unable to do. 

Your argument about larger more expensive universities being more important players in (what I presume to be) the Israeli economy may be true.

Interesting that they mainly explain the result as ‚Äúpoorer students are focused on other things‚Äù, much like another comment in this thread. 

I was responding to the title of this post, ‚Äústereotype accuracy‚Äù, which I think is a pretty clear dig at student protestors as fitting the ‚Äústereotype‚Äù of know-nothing angry rich kids, as I‚Äôve seen discussed in broader media. 

Also, come on - I‚Äôm not ‚Äúconstruct[ing] non-existent quotes‚Äù.

If it were a literal quote from someone not-yet-mentioned, I‚Äôd have cited it.

Why does it suggest disingenuousness to protest mostly at colleges that are large/important enough to enact meaningful change?

I don't disagree that using a manufactured quote to express some broad sentiment can be fine, and often useful. But the one you built was so extreme: ""spoiled brats who don't understand"" etc, that it reeked of strawmanning.

The reason I accused disingenuousness is that calculating the P&amp;L of your college, and the incremental impact of your action before deciding whether to protest what you think is genocide, seems more transactional than what genuine concern over innocent civilians should dictate.

This is just logically untrue unless someone has a precept that the actions of Hamas on 10/7, the annihalation of Israel, or the Muslim supremacy of the entire region are *necessary*, which you haven't demonstrated within their epistemology as true at all.

Conflating ""by any means"" and ""by any means necessary"" without consideration of existing precepts on necessity are incredibly important here: this argument is not consistent unless one who believes such is willing to say that Bibi's usage of ""defend [Israel's] security by any means necessary"" implies that they he is asserting support for all of Israel's past actions or *all possible future actions* such as the annihalation of Palestine or Jewish supremacy of the entire region if it secures Israel.

&gt; As for the end, your analogy is based on shoddy logic. If Netanyahu were to say they need to defend Israel ‚Äúby any means necessary‚Äù, that would mean the territory within the borders of Israel, not outside the borders. 

Please demonstrate to me where he clarifies this distinction in that speech. Otherwise, my logic holds because we have no evidence for this.

In either event, if this is true, the occupation of Golan Heights and the 6-day war may be condemned under this logic as that did not take place within the jurisdiction of Israel. I think there is rational argument there is reason for the 6-day war at the very least.

&gt; When SJP says they need to resist ‚Äúby any means‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt equate to ‚Äúby any means, besides targeting innocent civilians and using rape and torture as weapons of war‚Äù; it means ‚Äúby any means‚Äù without a qualifier.

Please demonstrate to me where SJP clarifies this distinction any where in their materials. Otherwise, my logic holds because we have no evidence for this.

Regardless, what any SJP member claims in no way impacts what a non-SJP member believes using the same language: people very readily have different precepts on necessity (otherwise, we're back to condemning Bibi's language!). Therefore, what SJP uses in no way actually implies *anything* about the necessity precepts of an average encampment protestor.",2,1716750683.0,t1_l5s5qd3
1d0sgma,l5s8n2v,kamjam16,"&gt;Please demonstrate to me where he clarifies this distinction in that speech. Otherwise, my logic holds because we have no evidence for this.

The distinction is inherently associated with the word Israel. Israel is a defined territory with defined borders. When I say ‚ÄúI will give my life to defend the United States‚Äù, I don‚Äôt need to qualify that by saying ‚Äúno, I won‚Äôt die to protect Toronto‚Äù. 

&gt;Please demonstrate to me where SJP clarifies this distinction any where in their materials. Otherwise, my logic holds because we have no evidence of this.

Again, no clarification is needed. It‚Äôs an all-encompassing phrase. It‚Äôs also a dog whistle letting supporters know that they support Hamas and their actions on 10/7.

This is not how the world works. People at a Nazi rally can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt support Nazi ideology, I just support keeping America for Americans‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. If you go to a Nazi rally, you‚Äôre a Nazi. If you go to an SJP rally, you support the SJP. 

Whether it‚Äôs trump supporters on the far right or SJP supporters on the far left, dog whistles and gaslighting won‚Äôt work in the long run. It‚Äôs a mechanism to escape justifying their actions in the moment, but people see the truth.",2,1716751310.0,t1_l5s71n2

This is conflation of the intention of the protection (the jurisdiction of Israel) and the means by which one may protect. Defending Toronto would not contribute to defending Israel unless Israel's existence depended on Toronto. This tell us nothing about whether ""by any means necessary"" means Bibi would be willing to destroy Toronto, as that would depend entirely on whether he believed destroying Toronto was *truly necessary* to destroy in order to protect Israel. Obviously I'm not going to say Bibi wants to destroy Toronto, because I do not have access to that information (I'm guessing no, though).

You have no where given evidence of what Bibi's necessity precepts are here, so we may reject the argument based on it.

People have the capacity to support the aims of a protest; can you point me to a Nazi rally which was not explicitly in support of at least some Nazi precepts? I may assume that someone going to a protest supports the precept of the event just fine, it doesn't really matter to me what they call themselves or what their other beliefs are (nomenclature is smoke and mirrors here, as you point out with your ""America for American"" comment).

This was not an SJP rally anyways, it was a protest helped organized by SJP specifically about University policy with respect to Israel and Palestine; I have explicitly never voted for a Libertarian candidate despite going to a protest organized by the Libertarian party in support of gun rights. I don't think someone showing up to an anti-abortion or pro-abortion protest by the Democrats or Republicans imply that person supports either party, respectively. Someone going to a rally?

1d0sgma,l5x4svf,DelayRevolutionary20,"Question: Where is this from?

I looked it up, and it‚Äôs being spread a lot on X (Twitter). I found that [the graph was created by Washington Monthly](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/05/24/are-gaza-protests-happening-mostly-at-elite-colleges/), with information pulled from Harvard‚Äôs ‚ÄúCrowd Counting Consortium‚Äù.

They claimed to be ‚ÄúUsing data from Harvard‚Äôs Crowd Counting Consortium‚Äù and ‚Äúnews reports of encampments‚Äù to match info to their college rankings. We should start by questioning whether they have ranked every college. Another thing to consider would be that there aren‚Äôt news reports for every encampment, or every protest, especially at little known private universities and colleges. Then, even if a protest is reported on by the news, we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a report that Washington Monthly saw.

Then we can look at their own article for evidence to the contrary that protests are only being held at ‚Äúelite colleges‚Äù. Take their info from public colleges (what UC Berkeley is).

https://preview.redd.it/sdoa348jg03d1.jpeg?width=1136&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01233ba3663abd71c61849f3086152fdb0461535

This distribution is much more even, and doesn‚Äôt really support the claim that protests are only happening at elite colleges. All the graph people have been sharing on X supports is that protests at private colleges with higher tuitions and fees are more likely to be reported on by the news and Harvard‚Äôs ‚ÄúCrowd Counting Consortium‚Äù.

And most importantly, the graphs also don‚Äôt take into account political leaning. The Pell Grant is given to people who can prove that they need it, and is given in varying degrees based on that need. Private universities in the south are way more likely to have students living in poverty, [like this graph from the census bureau states](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2022/demo/2021-state-county-maps.html). People in the south are also much more right leaning, like [this chart from Five Thirty Eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-red-or-blue-is-your-state-your-congressional-district/) can tell you. (note: right-leaning people are pro-Israel, and would not hold a Palestinian protest.)

1d0sgma,l5uxfl1,[deleted],"sure but if you‚Äôre a cheaper university you will almost certainly have a smaller investment fund relative to the elite private universities. the aim of most of these protests and encampments are divestiture on the part of the university, which wouldn‚Äôt really make sense at a tiny liberal arts college who‚Äôs pension account is managed at your local fidelity office.",0,1716799573.0,t3_1d0sgma

It'll be stolen recreated, and you'll get zero without recourse.

If you do manage, you'll walk on water. You'll find yourself winning everything  without exception regardless of the effort you put forth. You'll be showered with every resource you could ever want or need, even those unobtainable with cash. You will be celebrated, envied, and emulated.

Change that attitude quickly because right now is your only golden opportunity to enrich your life through actions you seemingly despise. You are being tested. Will you pass?

If you can take courses on religion, art, social history, linguistics, sociology, psychology and anthropology without it altering your worldview, you are living a dim and sad life. Rarely are human connections fueled by coworkers or friends discussing the latest physics papers, but they're often fueled by discussions of creative and social endeavors -- conversations about Netflix shows, about sports, about politics, about charity, about religion, about personal struggles. Those are the things that matter -- again, engineering and medicine matter, but not all STEM does, and not all humanities don't.

I won‚Äôt lie: People(both men and women) place more weight on looks then they‚Äôll admit.

But this is how I see it: People are entitled to their preferences but those who don‚Äôt want to date you simply due to your looks are probably incompatible with you to begin with.

The people you‚Äôd probably want to have a future with are not going to be the ones who dismiss you because of your height.

However, confidence is also important and I‚Äôll even say that being short and low in confidence is much much much more detrimental than just being short.

1cwzav0,l51m2w4,[deleted],"*sigh*  This post touched me deeply so I‚Äôll make some sacrifices here and write this essay from the POV of a woman.

I know short men that are attractive for their confidence alone. Adding to that -  their style and how they carry themselves takes it over the top. 

I have 3 brothers, 2 are incredibly tall and one is short and the shorter one, I could tell at some point was insecure about his height but now to me, I dare say he is the most attractive of all my brothers because of how he carries himself now. I kid you not. It‚Äôs like night and day. 

He does the most self-care, he carries intelligent conversations, he doesn‚Äôt seem or act desperate to be wanted, he is care-free (sometimes too care-free I get mad at him hahaha). He is emotionally aware, he has challenged himself these past 2 years and stepped out of his comfort zone to try new things. 

Around him, people are constantly laughing  (he taught me how to be a goof) but also they respect him because he is humble and doesn‚Äôt feel the need to prove himself around other men (which insecure men usually do). His confidence is loud and yet he doesn‚Äôt strive to be wanted or noticed or accepted. He is content with himself. 

And you should see his gf. She‚Äôs a total babe and complements his energy. She‚Äôs so serious but he stays goofing and they‚Äôre so cute together üòÇ. 

Why did I go into detail about this?

1. To show you that people will see you the way you see yourself. People are attracted to my brother because he oozes confidence and contentment in himself.  

2. And if people don‚Äôt see you the way you see yourself, then you have to understand that the way they see you is influenced by their reflection of how they see the world: of what they‚Äôve been taught. So you‚Äôll probably need to learn how to separate women‚Äôs responses from your worth because it‚Äôs truly not you. I know it‚Äôs hard but it‚Äôs very possible. I‚Äôll date a short guy if he‚Äôs right for me but I had to unlearn what I was taught too and some women -  though they label it as ‚Äúpreference‚Äù, truth is, it‚Äôs how they‚Äôve been taught to see the world that shapes that ‚Äúpreference‚Äù. Let‚Äôs call a spade a spade.

2. Focus on building your self-worth. Like f**k what people say, what the world says, but what do you say about yourself? How do you see yourself? Dude there is literally NO ONE that‚Äôs you in this world. Only one you. And I don‚Äôt mean to sound corny or cliche but you‚Äôre one unique person and there are 8 billion people in the world. That alone my dude, should be a starting point to see your worth. You bring something to the world and do it in a way that no one in this world can because no one is YOU. Think about that for a sec. And build on that.

All this to say, learn to see yourself better and people will see you better. And if not, they have their own perceptions to unlearn and learn but that‚Äôs not on you to carry. It seems like you‚Äôre carrying the warped perceptions of the world on your shoulders and even beginning to not like how you were born. It‚Äôs on them to change their mindsets. Not on you to wish you were different.",29,1716310602.0,t1_l50xleq
1cwzav0,l52s06f,LaionessQueen,"This. All of it. Especially the part of how they see you, is probably not about you but may be or is more likely because of how they view the world. It's not personal. It's just what they have learned and what they believe to be culturally and/or socially acceptable. 

As another female, please let me give my advice as well. Don't change yourself in hopes of being liked. Be authentic and a lot of people will see that. If you change anything just for someone to like you, then you'll never be fully happy and satisfied knowing they like a pretend-you. Not the real you. Authenticity will help with confidence and hopefully open your eyes to a world of literally billions of women who WILL find you attractive. Which leads me to my question... 

What kinds of girls do you usually go for? Are you not about looks in any way yourself? I mean, what if you're so focused on these girls you like and want to like you, that you haven't noticed girls who actually already do? Is that a possibility?

I'm Filipino and im in the bay too, and I have my own stories of the types I used to like who I believe will never be into me and later finding out that I just haven't noticed them. Or that they hide it well because they, too, fear rejection.

I have a guy friend who started out as a hook up but the more we hung out and the more I got to know him, I started to pull back on the hook up aspect and well i kinda friend zoned him. He's really good looking, he's not that tall either, probably your height, and im attracted to him at first. But again the more I got to know him the more I saw him as just my homie. Which he hated coz he then had to listen to me complain about other dudes i hook up with, who he may or may not know, but he understood. I mean one of the guys I'm really into is about 5'5 or 5'6 but that isn't a deterrent because he exudes self confidence and he's good to me and I find him so sexy for his boyish charms and looks (and uhh money, what someone else mentioned). 

Point is, don't be so hard on yourself. Maybe look beyond your own ""types"" and see if you're selling yourself short by chasing girls who clearly just want a guy friend to hang out with and feel ""safe"" that they can be themselves. You're young. You'll get there.",3,1716325168.0,t1_l51m2w4

1cwzav0,l514lhw,Entrefut,"Quick wholesome story, then I‚Äôll give you some general advice. 

One of my shortest friends just got married to one of the most gorgeous women in the world. He was initially not on her radar, but for a lot of reasons, she gravitated to him eventually and then never let go. They met in college and are now one of the happiest couples I‚Äôve had the pleasure of being friends with.

Height CAN be a determining factor if physicality is all you have to offer. The reality is that height is a very visceral way of immediately building presence and value. It might get you over the line in a lot of situations as a guy, but it by no means solves all the issues of dating. Fortunately for you, you‚Äôre fun, which is objectively more valuable over the course of a relationship. What it sounds like to me is that women enjoy you being around, but they can have you around anytime they want without committing the things that you want. 

If you want to have romantic relationships with these women and you aren‚Äôt getting that, then withdraw your cards from the game or find a new way to play. You are there for her to do all of the fun things she wants to do, then she can go off and sleep with whatever jerk she finds physically attractive just so she can tell her friends. 

You as a man cannot romantically survive off of implied or potential romance, you need actual experiences. Give attention to women who will bring you actual experiences, not potential ones. 

My advice is that you need to change who has access to your fun friendliness, as well as develop a bit more of the funny charismatic jerk side of your personality. When her friends made that comment and she dismissed you, the first thing that went into your head was you feeling defeated. You lost that game before you even started playing and they all could feel it. The next time a situation like that comes up, and she finds a reason to not like you, find a funny reason why she isn‚Äôt good for you. 

Them - ‚ÄúYou two would make a cute couple!‚Äù
You - ‚ÄúMaybe, but I‚Äôm way too funny for her, I need someone who can keep up.‚Äù

Her - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt find you physically attractive, you‚Äôre too short.‚Äù
You - ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs weird, I was thinking the same thing about you!‚Äù *Playful jab*

Hopefully you can see what I‚Äôm getting at. Don‚Äôt let women defeat you mentally AND physically. If you are short, dwelling on it does nothing for you, develop other skill sets for interacting with women and don‚Äôt be afraid to dismiss them the same way they dismiss you. You actively dismissing them playfully also makes you seem less desperate and more attractive overall. Your mentality and confidence CANNOT be reliant on someone else‚Äôs responses and attention, if it is then it‚Äôs not true confidence.

You are funny, you are intelligent, you are hitting the gym and getting in shape, you have lots of friends (male and female), and you have the humility to bash yourself a bit. All of these are far more important than just being taller for a romantic partnership, so give yourself some credit.

Back to my friend. I remember when he and his now wife first started dating. He was shocked, but absolutely none of us were. He was the life of the party no matter where we went and an absolute handful at times. Going out with him and going out without him were a night and day difference. Had he been tall and more boring, he might have hooked up with her sooner, but she would have moved onto someone more interesting eventually.

Don‚Äôt lie to yourself and assume you know exactly what women want. Don‚Äôt lie to yourself and assume that women know exactly what they want. The world is too big of a place to bash yourself and say the reason she doesn‚Äôt like you is because of X. The real reason is likely social pressure, expectations, marketing/ social media, and immaturity. She just likely doesn‚Äôt perceive you as a sexual option, because you haven‚Äôt cultivated and environment where she sees you like that. Stop chasing her, keep up the friendship, but put yourself out there with other girls and use her as social credit. She enjoys spending time with you, so will other girls, but don‚Äôt come into those interactions in a friendly way. Make the dynamic about something romantic early on and shoot your shot. Then if you get rejected, go laugh about it with your friends later. 

You have the hard parts together, now just drop the attachment to goofy things like height and looks and realize you‚Äôre better than that. There are PLENTY of ugly short dudes with beautiful women and it‚Äôs because they are better than their physical qualities. Why are height and looks so marketed? Simple, it is much harder to encapsulate personality traits into a marketing ad than something complex and cognitive. Find beautiful women who are more cognitive and complex (this gets easier with age). Good luck out there, pm me if you want some material to listen to or read about this stuff.

1cwzav0,l50jlll,cefiro22,"Hi OP, just wanted to chime in here (not sure if I can help but I have had similar experiences in the past)

I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô5 (maybe 5‚Äô6 at best?) Singaporean guy studying in a Singaporean university. I‚Äôve never had girls tell me directly that they‚Äôll date a short guy; however, I‚Äôve heard multiple girls voice the opinion that height is extraordinarily important when others are around. My girlfriend also tells me that most of her female friends keep talking about height when choosing partners (not in earshot of guys lol), so height is definitely important.

However, I‚Äôve had quite a few females express interest in me before. I think the vast majority of girls want to date guys that are taller; however, many girls are also willing to date a short guy (that‚Äôs still taller than them) if he is outstanding in other aspects. Personally speaking, my girlfriend is around 5‚Äô2 or 5‚Äô3, so she‚Äôs not much shorter than me.

I think you can improve your chances through 1) only expressing interest in girls shorter than you (admittedly a bit hard in the U.S.) 2) improve yourself more in other areas.

After I broke up with my ex, I invested into myself a lot more (new glasses, working out, new clothes, skincare, new haircut etc.). I definitely attained a lot more attention from girls than I did before dating my ex. It‚Äôs not really fair that we have to be 90th percentile for other aspects due to our height, but I guess that‚Äôs how our world works, so we just have to find ways to tilt the dating scene towards our favour.",6,1716296445.0,t1_l4zbugm

I mention those things as someone who deals with the opposite problem: I'm tall (6ft 2in/1.88m), but I am fat. Like, big-ol-dad-bod fat. And as much as I'm in good health, people have always had trouble looking past that to be interested in me. And truthfully, appearance matters to some people, and to varying degrees. It's a somewhat rough truth of life.

But here's another one of those truths, young fella: it gets way easier to accept as you get older and notch life's belt a little tighter. You're young; enjoy those years.  Focus less on the facets you can't change and worry about what you can. Dress clean and well, find a style that suits you. Take some of those new female friends you've made and have them judge some outfits while shopping. You'll get a lens of view from the other side and have a fun time to boot. 

After that, take your time. Develop interests, passions, and cool stories. Find something you love and get into the community for it. You'll find me at Games of Berkeley every Friday playing Magic: the Gathering and chatting up people just cuz I can. People find passionate people and people with hobbies more attractive.

I read this post and first of all want to validate your feelings, cause it is hard and demoralizing being a short Asian dude and trying to date. Everything you said in that post has been a feeling I've felt at some point in my life, especially the resentment/emasculation/jealousy. Especially on dating apps when people filter for height. So you're not alone.

That being said, much like supax04 who also responded, I'm happy with my romantic life at this point. I'm very lucky to be in an LTR of &gt;4 yrs with someone I find attractive. We live together and are happy, and we have plans to get married and have a family.

And it's not like I've only had the chance to be in this one relationship/date this one person. I dated plenty of other women who I thought were great as well. Not trying to humble brag, mainly saying this to demonstrate that being short does not prevent you from having a chance to meet other interesting people.

One part of your post stuck out to me:
""It's hard not to feel bitter and jealous of those guys who are born with good genes and have no trouble dating""

This is something I've felt too, but I feel is a pretty harmful belief. At my lowest I felt resentful of the fact that my short parents' genes mixed to make my short self who wasn't having good luck dating and thought to myself ""man, if I have a short son, he'll feel the same way about me."" And that was just sad. And I felt depressed to be myself. But that's totally changed, and at this point in life I wouldn't want to trade lives with anyone.

But dating and attraction is tough in general, not just for us short guys. There are plenty of things that are hard to change that people get written off for, but it doesn't mean those things make them a ""disgusting"" person. Things like race, skin conditions, weight, facial appearance, etc. Think about girls you interact with who you are attracted to vs. not attracted to. Would you say you are ""disgusted"" by the ones you are not attracted to?

Maybe all of these other people who get passed up as well have ""unlucky genetics"" like us, but I think if you started talking to people, you'd be surprised how many people (of all genders) feel the same way about something in their life that we feel about our height. That is to say, it's easy to feel like this one attribute is the problem, when in reality, dating is often a frustrating experience.


You sound like a kind, fun dude who is trying to keep your chin up. I think you should try to keep being optimistic, and you should be kind to yourself the same way that you are to others. 

Don't say your face is unattractive, because its probably a fine face. Women can tell if you don't feel good about yourself, based off of how you act and hold yourself , even if you don't say it. and it's a turnoff because insecure people often take their insecurities out on other people. I did a lot of therapy, and it's helped me manage my insecurities and anxieties, and as a result be a much better person to the people in my life.

Be yourself, take care of yourself, and keep an open mind and I'm sure you'll be able to have fun times and find love sooner than you think.



[Also, as an additional point, I feel like people are extra shallow in college, when everyone is comparing how ""hot"" everyone is. Later in life, when people start dating more for partnership, you will quickly see that the people in your life with good personalities get scooped up into fulfilling LTRs, regardless of their looks, and people who are conventionally attractive with bad personalities are suddenly in the opposite position and don't understand why they are suddenly undesirable]

[Second additional point: maybe you are being overly selective. If you opened up your dating pool to people you might not initially consider, after getting to know them you might be more attracted than you think. Some of my best dating experiences/relationships started out with someone who I didn't expect to be attracted to initially. (Some of whom were even taller than me)]",5,1716329948.0,t3_1cwzav0

1cwzav0,l51rh7f,RocketsYoungBloods,"I have a friend who is maybe 5'5"".  Many years ago, he got into the whole pickup artist (PUA) culture after reading ""The Game"".  I never read it myself, but I believe it's all about demonstrating value, making yourself the prize, playfully negging girls, getting them to seek your validation, etc.  He was slaying girls left and right.  I don't know that they were all super hot, but he was racking up the body count.  If what you're looking for is hookups, it might help to read that book.  Not sure if girls are wise to the pickup tactics now though, since it got pretty popular back in the day.  I knew some girls that were reading the book.  They even had a show called ""The Pickup Artist"", where PUA experts coached socially awkward guys to pickup girls in social settings.

If you're looking for a serious girlfriend, you'll need more than these PUA tricks.  But it sounds like girls already enjoy spending time with you.  So after you get your foot in the door (or something else in something else), seems like you'll be all set.  good luck!",1,1716312481.0,t3_1cwzav0

In every relationship I‚Äôve been in, my female partner has always gotten worried/jealous about how other women act around me. Desirable men attract attention that their partners seek to destroy.

My advice:
1. There‚Äôs someone out there for everyone. I‚Äôm sure you can always either lower your standards, or improve your attractiveness.

2. Don‚Äôt actively try to be friends with single women who are also interested in being friends. They will always do just that, be your friend. You have near 0 odds of changing that, so don‚Äôt bank on it. 

They will also repel single women that are interested in being more than friends given that they‚Äôd rather maintain their friendship than risk losing it to someone else who gives you what you want.",1,1716324342.0,t3_1cwzav0

You do realize that the MAJORITY of students in 1964 felt threatened by Mario.  They did.  The reason that the Graduate is so funny is that most students \_DID\_ want to work in plastics.  They were at Cal (the more things change the more they stay the same) to get a degree, get a job, get a suburban house.  And so when Mario talked of throwing oneself upon the gears of the machine could say (if they had this language) that such speech was ""hateful"" to their aspirations to get a degree, get a job, etc. etc. etc.

For example, ""disrupts a person's ability to participate in activities like education, work, or public life"" or ""promote hate"".  Trying to find an objective standard for those things, I would submit, is impossible and thus we are then forced, absent such a standard to fall back upon how POWER combines with language and can oppress..

I think instructive always to step back and look at a position/place antithetical to one's views.  I would submit that, for some, in Oklahoma today the inability to say a prayer during the morning or study poetry without reference to the Bible ""disrupts a person's ability to participate in activities like education, "".  Now they are wrong.  Deeply wrong, IMHO, because of how their actions impact those of non believers.  But they sincerely believe they have been harmed and with state power are absolutely seeking to compel a remedy.

The world is filled with objectionable things.  It is.  But there is REAL danger, which classic liberalism understood so well and post-modernist leftists ignore, in trying to exercise those things.  With no objective standard of what constitute ""hate"" it is defined by those with the biggest hammer and that, sadly, might be in your hands today but can easily be in those opposed to you tomorrow.",1,1732226806.0,t1_lyaj5bj

If you don‚Äôt like it or there‚Äôs enough public outcry you change the board, their ruling or you get rid of it if it doesn‚Äôt do anything.

At some point in the past 20 years, the focus on safety shifted from physical violence and threats to mental well-being. So now people claim that being exposed to ideas or language that either directly or indirectly implies some negative impact on a social group is ""violence"" that makes a space ""unsafe"", and these claims are made under this misguided principle that our collective objective should be to create ""safety"" for everyone. Worse, this emotional protectionism is largely prioritized in tradeoffs with things like academic freedom or free speech, which by definition entail ideas that we're now calling ""violent"" and ""unsafe."" People speak about someone talking about gender as biology as though they're talking about actually violent ideas like forced labor camps or amputation. Come on!

This is nonsense. The world is full of ideas that violate each and every one of us. Our goal should be to uplift and empower those that are most on the receiving end of these ideas to better refute, succeed, and motivate change in spite of these ideas.

I dont understand your meaning here. It previous had homes, then was purchased through eminent domain by the university, then left for over a year as a wasteland before being reclaimed as a park and free speech zone. People were killed by police when then university tried to take it over again and history repeated itself a handful of times with the university calling in police to use violent force over and over. This last one was just yet another chapter on the same saga. I agree it was in poor state with the homeless encampment (which now exist everywhere really) but how how do you see converting the space after another round of police violence and another round of walls compatible with ""paying homage"" to it, or put another way, how can homage be paid in a meaningful way that doesn't contradict this?",-7,1717721025.0,t1_l7euwm8

I wanted it as a Christmas present for my friend Jeff, a cartoonist who lives on Lopez Island, Washington. Downtown Top Dog staff told me it was only available at the Durant location. 

I went up to the Durant location the next day and asked if I could buy a print of the famous ‚Äúfree speech hotdog‚Äù painting. The kid behind the cash register said ‚Äúhang on, let me get Richard.‚Äù 

He came out all annoyed and asked what I wanted. I said I wanted to buy a print of the famous ‚Äúfree speech hotdog‚Äù painting that was featured in their restaurants. I said that the downtown staff told me to come to the Durant location to buy one. 

Richard asked me, angrily, what I was talking about. I pointed at the famous ‚Äúfree speech hotdog‚Äù painting and said ‚ÄúI want to buy a print of that, please, for a Christmas present.‚Äù 

He looked at me, with a disgusted look on his face, and said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt sell prints.‚Äù I said ‚Äúoh, at the downtown location, they told me I could buy that *points at famous ‚Äúfree speech hotdog painting*‚Äù at the Durant location. 

Richard replied to me ‚Äúthat‚Äôs an original painting from 1976, it is NOT for sale.‚Äù I said ‚Äúok I think we have a misunderstanding. I think it is beautiful cartooning work and I wanted to buy a print of it for my friend Jeff for Christmas.‚Äù 

As I turned to walk out he said ‚Äúoh, we sell posters.‚Äù And proceeded to send one of his lackeys up into the attic to retrieve a giant rolled up poster reproduction of the artwork in question. 

He charged me $10 for a giant poster and wished me happy holidays. I mailed it to Jeff my cartoonist friend and it was beloved.

No NIMBY says they're a NIMBY. Saying we need more housing is one of the first things on a NIMBY's lips, quickly followed by ""but..."" Either they mean ""but somewhere else"" or ""but not like that"", like you are now

&gt; In an ideal situation, they‚Äôd own their own place, bc businesses have the right to own the property they work on

Why? The business rents the property, just like how people rent properties. Why are they entitled to owning it? Especially when it's just a small part of a larger more complete complex?

Not to mention they sign onto renting property with the full knowledge that they aren't the owner. That includes closure of the parent property, the selling of the building the parent property does, or any changes the owner does. The details of said contract may vary, but there's nothing *inherently* wrong with that (I'm aware there's room for abuse, but that's clearly not evidently happening here)

If we go with your suggestion where the business owns the full rights of the property they operate in and can fully block anything the original owner of the land/building is doing, we quickly fall to a slippery slope where almost no development can happen, or at least no development without exorbitant costs. Ergo, basically no development, hence: You're a NIMBY

&gt; forcing the closure of one of the most important spaces in Berkeley.

lmao the downtown Top Dog is not one of the most important spaces in Berkeley. It's not even the most important Top Dog. That whole downtown restaurant strip isn't even all that important compared to the Asian Ghetto or the shops surrounding Telegraph",1,1715151867.0,t1_l33ir0a
1cly9tt,l34b9hq,[deleted],"""it still is another failure of capitalism by forcing a building for decades to close down.¬†""

It is not a bug, it is a feature. That's a prime spot in downtown right next to the University and BART. You can keep all the stores on the ground level and build apartments on top, reducing rent, commute, making the streets safer, and increasing housing in a city that desperately needs it. 

""if a business has been operating for literal DECADES, they should have some right to that space/building""

Why? They do not own the space.

""¬†I‚Äôm not trying to be a NIMBY, because we absolutely need high rises, but this was still a result of ppl owning this space and deciding what to do for TopDog.""

You are most definitely being a NIMBY. Topdog can decide what to do in the spaces they own. 

""If not, they‚Äôd PAY for a new space for them in the meantime until the space is finished and any lost costs.""

Topdog has a lease. When the lease is over, the owner of the building doesn't owe anything to topdog. 

""This should not be a situation that is applauded. So many other avenues could‚Äôve happened instead of forcing the closure of one of the most important spaces in Berkeley.""

The fact that you are one of the very few not applauding should give you a sign that your interests do not line up with the rest of the community's. Students and residents are desperate for more housing. Even the owner of topdog is applauding: ""‚ÄúBut I have to say in their regard, they have been absolutely fantastic. A lot of these big corporations don‚Äôt have any good manners or care about who was there, but they offered us a space, they are helping us move our stuff and have offered a place to carry us over until their building is finished.‚Äù

A defensive war is not unlawful. Israel is not targeting civilians. Hamas is. All of Israel's wars were defensive so it's not the same. 

It is time to stop saying ""76 years"" what 76 years? 76 years since the Arabs were offered an independent state which they never ever had in the region before and they refused it in the name of Arab imperialism? 76 years since 5 Arab countries started a genocidal war against the Jews and lost? Losing a war that 5 Arab countries started is not an injustice. Also between 1948-1967 the West Bank and Gaza were under Jordanian and Egyptian control and there was no attempt to create a Palestinian state - why? There was also barely any contact between the Arabs in the west bank and Gaza and Israelis - so what brutality are you talking about? Or maybe you are talking about the Arabs who stayed in Israel, enjoy human rights, got Israeli citizenship, and are now 20% of the Israeli population? Brutal indeed. Real terror.

I know it is your favorite blood libel kinda like in the 19th century antisemites spread the blood libel that Jews were killing European children and drinking their blood on passover. That's also a lie btw, but it rallies the mob to go and slaughter Jews. 

Similarly, by no definition is this a genocide. Biden said so, the US defense secretary said so and the ICJ said they did not find plausible evidence for genocide, and so,  like a deck of card your arguments fall. 

Hamas was elected in 2007. There were no elections since. It is also a recognized terror organization just because it was elected does not absolve it from being a terror organization. 

Israel was not created on Palestinian land. Why do you think it was Arab land? It was a land that was occupied by empires for 2000 years. That's a fact. The last independent people on this land were the Jews. One of those empires was Arab in the 7th century and they did their best to erase local cultures but they never had a national or political entity there. There was never a Palestinian country. The Arabs got there by conquering, colonizing and erasing local cultures. There were Arab villages that had a right to their villages but they did not own the land in between. That is why the partition plan made sense because there were two people who wanted the land that was freed after WWI. Saying that it was Arab land is just buying into Arab Imperialism and erases that deep connection the Jews have to this land. 

Israel agreed to the partition plan and defended itself from numerous wars it did not start, so who's the aggressor? 

Hamas is defending the Palestinians? Hamas is abusing the Palestinians and is an obstacle for peace. They did nothing to build a state their entire goal is the elimination of Israel. Please. Why do you think Israel left Gaza in 2005? It doesn't want Gaza. The ultimate outcome for Gaza as far as Israel is concerned, is if it became a prosperous peaceful territory on the way to a state. This cannot happen when Gazans/Hamas use all the money generously donated to them to build the world's largest terror base and to enrich their leaders, because obviously. 

People are not obligated to organize into a state but if you want to claim an identity there has to be some evidence for said identity. The Palestinians have every right to self identify now, but they cannot re-create history and claim that they self-identified in the past. They identified as Arabs. The word ""Palestine"" is foreign to them. It came from Hebrew and was used by the colonial powers to name the region not a people. The Arabs in fact wanted the British mandate to be called ""Southern Syria"" not ""Palestine."" 

Either way, as I said there were two groups who wanted the land the Jews, with undeniable connection and history and the Arabs , some of whom lived there for hundreds of years. Both claims are legitimate. However only one side was willing to compromise - the Jews.

Unfortunately for you, I‚Äôve actually read the papers on Ashkenazi Jews genetics and it beyond doubt that they have middle eastern genes, even the lay article you sent mentioned it. 40% of Ashkenazi Jews have European maternal DNA (mitochondrial DNA is maternal DNA - you may have missed that), originating in 4 women and middle eastern paternal DNA - aka middle eastern fathers. 60% are not of that European mothers lineage. It‚Äôs interesting because you can actually see that when you look at Ashkenazi Jews. Some look European and some \*still\* look middle eastern, or a mix. If you look at the antisemitic caricatures of Jews from the early 20th century you will see that they look middle eastern. Why? Oh yeah - because they are from the Middle East. Do you think the antisemites invented that stereotype out of thin air?¬†

Obviously when a group of people spends 2000 years in Europe there will be mixing with local population. R\*pe was a common occurrence in general and during pogroms in particular. Did you know that there are very few Black people in America that don‚Äôt have European genes? Are you saying those people are no longer Black?¬†

Israel is the homeland of the Jews with continuous history in the land whether or not they had independence - they always identified as a people in this land. That‚Äôs indisputable based on extensive historical and archeological evidence. They actually did have independence way after the Babylonian exile under the Hasmoneans but that‚Äôs beside the point. There‚Äôs no doubt that Jews originated in Israel and are a people. There‚Äôs also no doubt the even Ashkenazi Jews have middle eastern DNA, that Jews from all diasporas are closely related genetically and importantly that all Jews maintained the ethnicity and culture of Israel/Judea for 2000 years.¬†

It‚Äôs hilarious that antisemites try to erase Jewish history and claim that Judaism is not an ethnicity while at the same time cry about Israel being an ‚Äúethnostate‚Äù which it is not. Can you make up your minds? 

Just because Judaism doesn‚Äôt map to \*your\* knowledge of religion, doesn‚Äôt mean you can ‚Äúmansplain‚Äù to us what Judaism is. It is not a religion like Christianity or Islam. I am sorry if that is very difficult for people who center the world around themselves to understand. Judaism does not proselytize - it does not encourage people to join. It is really difficult to become Jewish. Because it is a tribe, a people, an ethnicity and a religion.¬†

Jews came from Judea - hence the name. They did not come from Palestine because Palestine never existed. It was a Hebrew name of ancient invaders who have nothing to do with the current Palestinians (pleshet is invader in Hebrew). It was given to a region by colonizers (the Romans) but it was never a people or a geopolitical entity until the 20th century when it was coined as opposition to the national aspirations of the Jews.¬†You know, the 1960s was not that long ago there is plenty of evidence about this. One example are MLKs speeches - none of them mention the ""Palestinians.""

All this is just blatant propaganda. Israelites (Hebrews) originated from a part of the Canaan, not Iraq. You also can't really measure whether Arabs or Israelites came first, as both are descendants of various peoples with different origins.

It does serve as a historic document for people that existed and has some information corroborated by archeology and other sources but some storylines are fairytales.¬†

Science has shown that the Jews are descendants of the Cnaanites. Neither were the earliest inhabitants of this land. I think the earliest findings in Israel are from 250,000 years ago from an early culture called Acheulian. None of these ancient people remained, and the Palestinians cannot claim this ancient history to themselves. There‚Äôs no evidence for it. Genetically most people who identify as Palestinians today came from various Arab countries - Yemen, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia. Most of them are fairly recent immigrants from the 19th century on. You can tell by their genetics and also by their last names which indicate where they came from: Al-Masri - from Egypt, Masarawah - also Egyptian, Al-Khurani - from Horan is Syria, Al-Hijaz - from Saudi Arabia - and the list goes on and on.

It is 100% certain is that the ancient Jews did not conquer ‚ÄúPalestine,‚Äù because Palestine never existed and because the word ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù was invented by the Jews for a people who were Greek invaders, controlled the southern coastline of Israel and fought the Jews until they disappeared around 600BCE. These Greeks are not related to the modern day ‚ÄúPalestinians‚Äù who are Arabs and did not call themselves Palestinians until the 1960s.¬†

You cannot call yourself by a name coined by a people who came after you lol.¬†

When the British wanted to label their mandate, the Arabs actually opposed the name ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù and wanted to be called ‚ÄúSouthern Syria,‚Äù this tells you everything you need to know about their attachment to the name. 

A more ancient data point: Palestine is not ever mentioned in the Quran. However Israel is mentioned as the land that belongs to the Jews.¬†

Arabs arrived in this land in the 7th century, so what you said is complete fiction. You are disgustingly appropriating ancient cultures as ‚ÄúPalestinian‚Äù when they were not.¬†

This has to be the stupidest sentence you ever wrote: ‚ÄúHow are European Jewish women managing to have Levantine Arab children?‚Äù¬†At least I hope for you that it is. Jewish women did not have Arab Levantine children. They had Jewish children. Jewish children are from Judea. I‚Äôll let you think about it for a minute. They are not Arabs.¬†Arabs came from Arabia after the Jewish diaspora begun. 

Arab culture and Islam are not indigenous to the Levant. Judaism is.¬†

Ashkenazi Jews lived in Europe for 2000 years but they are not European. Their DNA is distinct from actual Europeans and is closer to the DNA of other Jew in other diaspora.¬†

Ashkenazi Jews are Jews who were in exile for 2000 years. Some of them are mixed, but almost all of them are descendants of middle eastern Jews.¬†That's just science dude. 

The origins and history of the Jews is in the land of Israel. You can find it under almost every stone. It is indisputable and you cannot erase it no matter how hard you try. You can‚Äôt colonize your ancestral homeland.

Finally for the last time. Jews came from Judea not from ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù because Palestine never existed. You can‚Äôt invent a people. People have certain characteristics - they talk about themselves, others talk about them, they have currency and leaders. The ‚ÄúPalestinians‚Äù never had any of that. Until the 1960s there were Arab tribes living in separate villages and they had a pan-Arab identity not a national one. It is still a tribal society like the rest of the Arab world. That‚Äôs one of the reasons they have mostly failed states because their societal structure is not built for states. But that‚Äôs a different topic.¬†",1,1718585438.0,t1_l8wq8v5

- waiting 2 weeks for 900k civilians to evacuate rafah
- 4 hour humanitarian pauses per day
- israel continuing to provide water and electricity to gaza (when has a country ever been expected to provide water and electricity to another country it is at war with)
- civilian to combatant death ratio significantly below what we typically consider genocides where 90%+ of the deaths are civilians

This is not the behavior of an army targeting civilians.

1dg25ly,l8tynv0,[deleted],"In the 1970s, the Bay Area had the Symbionese Liberation Army, a group of predominantly white, privileged, self-described radical leftists, who ended up murdering people, including a Black, progressive Oakland schools superintendent named Marcus Foster. Members were ultimately killed in a raid on their hideout after refusing to be arrested. One of my father's oldest friends was actually married to one of the founding members, a woman named Nancy Ling Perry. He literally watched on live TV as the building she was holed up in was raided by police who shot and killed armed members. He was never the same person after that. 

The group infamously kidnapped Patty Hearst, who ended up being their accomplice, until she conveniently was able to claim she didn't actually want to support their efforts. Since she was rich, and her father was William Randolph Hearst, nothing really happened to her.

So many people act like only right wing people in America are capable of domestic terrorism, and while they absolutely are and are a major issue, many in the alt-left, far-left, or however you want to describe them, are absolutely behaving in a terroristic manner, and have been for some time now.",6,1718523380.0,t3_1dg25ly

And she wasn't spared by the police, she just happened to not be at the house at the time, but was with William and Emily Harris, both of whom received similar sentences for the bank robbery (seven and eight years). If anything, the treatment of Hearst was punitive considering her circumstances--she was also locked in a closet for months while she was being repeatedly raped.

This is my biggest problem with self-described ""anti-Zionists"". Yes, the way Israel was established involved a lot of killing and displacement of Palestinians from land they'd been living on for a long time. It was violent and a lot of atrocities were committed against a shitload of innocent people. You could argue that the original Zionist project was a bad idea. Many countries were created through bad ideas: colonialism, slavery, territorial conquest, forced displacement, genocide, etc. The history of humanity isn't pretty.

But the thing is, the creation of Israel *already happened*. There's no time machine that can go back and undo the creation of the Israeli state before it began. Israel has been a country for 80 years now. Millions of people live there. Multiple generations of Israelis have lived their entire lives knowing that as their only homeland. If the goal of Anti-zionists is the elimination of the state of Israel and the return of all its former territory to Palestinian control, what becomes of the 7 million Israeli Jews *currently* living there? When you ask Anti-Zionists this question, they tend to get real quiet. Probably because they know what will happen to Israeli Jews but don't want to say it out loud. 

I think most reasonable people agree that a two-state solution is the best way to resolve this conflict. But slogans like ""From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will be Free"" are an explicit rejection of a two-state solution. If you're going to chant slogans like that, you need to have the balls to admit what will actually happen if the slogan comes true. Hamas at least has the balls to admit they want to kill or expel every single Jew from the Levant and create a Palestinian state for Palestinian Muslims *only*. That's their goal, and they're not shy about it. But the ""soft"" Anti-Zionists at these university protests seem to believe (or at least pretend) that dissolving the Israeli state and replacing it with a Palestinian one can be achieved without a 2nd Holocaust, but they refuse to explain *how* that would work.",21,1714757300.0,t1_l2f7493
1cj3d0t,l2jvth5,T_Insights,"There's a lot of misrepresentation here. Anti-Zionism is opposed to the state of Israel as an entity because it has different privileges based on race or religion. Ethnostates are objectionable wherever they exist. What anti-Zionists want is a multi-ethnic democracy with equal protection under the law and to allow displaced Palestinians to return.

And ""how"" would it work? How did it work in South Africa when apartheid was abolished? How did it work in the US when segregation was abolished? There was no mass expulsion or murder. The laws changed, as did the fundamental character of the state. It caused friction for a while, but we've made a lot of progress since then. In these cases the major difference is that the government structures largely remained after the change, whereas Anti-Zionism seeks to reconstruct the government into one with equal representation for everyone who lives there. Things like this have happened multiple times in history without genocidal violence.

I can't speak for all anti-Zionists, but I and the people I know don't believe anyone should be expelled. We believe the Israeli state is fundamentally premised on giving special status to Jewish people, while seeking to erase Palestinians as a people by increasingly encroaching on their land and subjecting them to violence and securitization.

The example of ""Abolish Italy"" is a straw man - Italy does not give special racial or religious privileges to some citizens over others. Most citizens are ethnic Italians, but being Italian by ancestry doesn't mean you are afforded more rights or protections than any other Italian citizen. In the case of the Israel/Palestine conflict, both groups (and many others historically speaking) can claim a historic/ethnic attachment to the land. That means both should have equal rights under the law and representation in government, which the Israeli state does not allow.",2,1714835033.0,t1_l2fd6ui

1cj3d0t,l2k4d0c,T_Insights,"I really appreciate your measured response despite our disagreement here.

If the question between us is ""what does Zionism really mean"" I think we have to look more closely at the history.  The Zionist motto was ""A land without a people for a people without a land."" This is definitionally impossible; there is no land without a people except remote unlivable areas of the Antarctic. By saying ""a land without a people,"" the Zionist movement immediately denies the rights of any non-Jew living in Palestine. In order for the Zionist project to succeed as Jewish state, those people had to be slaughtered and displaced. The legacy of this erasure and denial of humanity exists today in Israel, and this is the central issue anti-Zionists are talking about. The foundation of the Israeli state was based on violent ethnic cleansing, and that ethos has carried through into modern Israeli law and policy. Now the remaining Palestinians are crowded into what is effectively an open-air prison camp with no political representation or rights in Israel (because this was a land without a people, right? So the people here don't really deserve human rights, right?) So anti-Zionists today are opposed to that state as it exists.

What I will say is, there are a LOT of uncritical antisemitic rubes in the anti-Zionist movement, just like there are a lot of rabidly racist Zionists. Both hurt their own cause. Our task now is to try to lift the conversation out of the vitriol so we can start answering the question ""what would a post-Zionist Israel/Palestine look like"" in good faith.",3,1714838083.0,t1_l2k2ilp

1cj3d0t,l2jmndy,mountains_of_nuance,"That‚Äôs false. I don‚Äôt think blood quantum and blood and soil nationalism is ever the way, but if you want to play that game: Among SWANA Jews only Yemeni Jews share significant genetic ancestry with local Arabs/muslims. Remember too that Jews as an ethnoreligious group were attacked by colonizing empires and cleansed from the land, ending up in MENA spots like Baghdad and Yemen 2k years before Islam even existed (and certainly before the region was colonized/indigenous groups were Arabized). Also Ashkenazim plot fairly closely with Mizrahim, Samaritans and Palestinian christians (some of whom were almost certainly Judean converts, not that that should ever be used to suggest Ashkenazim are less Jewish, given they‚Äôve kept their culture/language/calendar/landed agricultural holidays etc alive for 2k years of diaspora).

Finally, the idea that Jewish life in Muslim majority SWANA/MENA was hunky dory before Israel‚Äôs reconstitution as a modern state is simply revisionism; Jews were dhimmis. Second class residents. In some places Jews were disallowed shoes, owning a horse, paid extra tax or were simply massacred periodically. Handfuls of individual relationships with neighbors do not contradict that.

Soon all of these intraJewish ethnic distinctions will be moot; Israel is at least 60% Mizrachi now but many if not most people are mixed (plus beta israelim and many other Jewish minorities) and increasingly mixing and with generations born since 48 and of course the significant Jewish population that was never forced out - Jerusalem for example was majority Jewish at the turn of the century - the categories will cease to be meaningful except in liturgy (Sephardim have some unique practices for example).

Anyway here‚Äôs a list of how dhimmitude looked in MENA (not great).

Mizrahim from the Arab world (Arab jews) excluding Yemenites are more closely related to Palestinians than they are to Ashkenazim. Also Yemenites are literally the *least* closely related to Palestinians as Yemenites are essentially my pure peninsular Arabs whereas Palestinians are Levantine.  

You are either severely misinformed or intentionally spreading disinformation. You post on ancestry subs regularly so I don‚Äôt know how you could possibly not know any of this. So it certainly appears as if you are intentionally spreading disinformation. Why? What is the point? This consistent lying about the ancestry of both Palestinians and Jews is beginning to seem sinister at this point especially when it‚Äôs coming from folks who obviously know they are spreading false information. You just claimed that the only group of Jews who share significant ancestry with indigenous Palestinians are Yemenites. Yemenites are the single group who share the least amount of ancestry with Palestinians. Palestinians are of overwhelmingly Canaanite ancestry. Yemenites are of overwhelmingly peninsular arab ancestry.

You are correct that blood quantum is bullshit. Unfortunately Zionist brought it into the conversation with their original lie which claimed Palestinians are actually not native to the region and Jews are the true natives. Ancestry tests have proven that to be outlandishly false. Ancestry tests have shown us what those who are concerned with truth as opposed to a narrative they wish were true have always known. Palestinians are the *most* native. They have continuously existed in the same place since Natufian culture (12,000+ years). And while *most* Jews do have a minority indigenous ancestry from over a thousand years ago, that does not somehow make us the ‚Äútrue natives.‚Äù Let alone make Palestinians any less native. Kurds and Armenians also have a minority indigenous ancestry. That doesn‚Äôt make them the ‚Äútrue natives‚Äù either. Palestinians, the people whose ancestors lived in the same place 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 years ago etc, are the true natives.

How can you look at your own ancestry and claim to be more indigenous than someone who is not only of 75%+ Canaanite ancestry, but whose family all lived there continuously for the last multiple thousands of years? I just don‚Äôt understand it. And even more incomprehensible, how can you claim people who convert to Judaism are somehow more indigenous than the native population? Why is there this need to deny the legitimacy of another group of peoples identity and ancestry? How does one justify this? 

Idk about you but I am disgusted by lies about the ancestry of Jews. Hearing someone claim Ashkenazim are 10% European ethnic poles pisses me off. I have a feeling you feel the same way. So why do you turn around and knowingly do the exact same thing to another group of people? Is it some kind of subconscious jealousy or something? Do you just hate them and have no qualms about spreading lies about them and their identity and ancestry? Why are you doing something to another group of people that you wouldn‚Äôt want done to you?

Every Thursday evening they also buy pizza and beers and you are free to eat if you want. With a Berkeley clipper card you can take the 51b down from campus for free. Sure, the folks on the Monday courses are not always the most coherent, but every single instructor is a volunteer, and is paid in food at most.

If you go 2x per week (say Saturday/Monday + Thursday) for 3 months (about one semester) you will come out to about to about 3x4x2 = 24 sessions with at least around 48 sail hours, if not more as well as around 10-12 meals. Moreover, signing up as a member entitles you to the weeklong junior skipper course which is much more intense than the casual sail lessons you get most of the time, provided you can rig your own boat and you do a couple of volunteer hours (when I say a couple, it literally means 2 and you can use that time to learn something useful like bosuning). Moreover, if you log 12 hours of volunteer time, you get a free renewal for your membership.

The club has had 3,474 members in the last 2 years and 19,026 since 2009. Most of these members take classes to learn from scratch or improve their skills either sailing boats or windsurfing. The club has given 2,942 lessons last year.
The club is $99 for 3 months for students, $120 for adults, with no other costs for classes or use of equipment. We will waive that fee if you volunteer 10 hours making the club free for many who have more time than money. Any sailing club around the bay charges sometimes more than $1000 for 3 days of sailing instruction for just a beginner class. Sure the level of the instructors can vary because it is just unpaid volunteers, but some of them a world class sailors who have raced or sailed around the world. The club is not for everyone but it is also a unique, incredibly diverse community.
The club organizes also monthly introductory sail for the public (Open House), and we partner with local schools and summer programs to take kids out on the water. Every year the club offers more 2500+ free rides. For this community service, the club benefits from a berth fee waiver granted by a resolution passed by the City of Berkeley in the 1980s. This fee waiver also benefits a few other non-profits doing community work.
For this community work and for teaching safe boating, the club is partially funded through a grant from the Department of Boating and Waterways from the State of California.
The club teaches unique skills that are not taught at other, more expensive clubs, and the club has used J-Dock to teach these skills for more than 50 years.

About half of US states enacting mask bans durimg the mid-20th century to prevent Klan members from anonymously intimidating minorities and Civil Rights groups. Courts have had mixed feelings on these laws, but are likely to look more favorably on them in a university setting. 

These laws fall generally under reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, and so long as they are not overbroad or selectively enforced, they are Constitutional with respect to the 1st Amendment. Limited public figures (e.g. people participating in a public protest) have never been found to have a right to absolutely anonymous assembly, and there is a legitimate government purpose in preventing the kind of intimidation and atmosphere of fear which masked mobs often generate.

It is possible the courts would rule that the UC system has not shown that it could not allow masks and prevent protesters from creating a heckler‚Äôs veto (as was just ruled to have occurred at UCLA) through some other manner. That would make the mask ban a 1st Amendment violation, but likely at the cost of the courts instructing the UC system to declare obstructing protests as illegal assemblies and to send in police against all protesters rather than just those who engage in anonymous intimidation.

Your 4th Amendment claim is simply spurious. The right to protections against unreasonable search and seizure does not somehow extend a penumbra to the right to facial anonymity in public while advocating for political change.",3,1724240364.0,t1_lj69972

Well, for one, the masking part is not really relevant, because masking itself is not made against policy here. The UC system explicitly allows masking so long as it is not accompanied by other behaviors.

Second, uh so? The university is a separate institution from state police, and its policies are not laws. The university is perfectly within its rights to place added restrictions on students so long as those restrictions do not violate state or federal law, or the Constitution. In this case, that means the university may have reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions which serve a legitimate governmental purpose.

&gt;It also violates freedom of expression in the 1st amendment, you can‚Äôt tell people what clothes they can or can‚Äôt wear. 

You can. Public nudity is a crime except in indicated areas. Additionally, not all freedom of expression counts as freedom of speech, nor is all freedom of speech protected on campus. Students may not, for instance, disrupt classes in the name of freedom of speech.

A student smothering themselves in sterilized feces, to borrow a trope from Joel Feinberg‚Äôs *Offense to Others*, would not be within their rights to attend school, given the distress this would cause, unless their action was intimately connected to their protest and no other effective means of protest were available.

The relevant decision here would be *Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence*.

Baseline Rumor:
After giving it all, Mendoza, justifiably, felt that he earned the job.
Some staff (our ex OC) allegedly didn't believe in him. Actually got a transfer QB (Rogers) with promises of starting.
(You recall Mendoza being pulled at key moments and even one game and getting randomly subbed by Rogers?)
Mendoza‚Äôs team (allegedly his dad) felt insulted by this. His son earned it.
They‚Äôve been working behind the scenes to get him to join his bro in Indiana.
Fernando balled out and now the staff is begging him to stay.

Too late. Feelings are hurt. He enters the portal.

Lunatic Fringe Rumor:
The Mendoza team complaint about the Mendoza-Rogers issue may have directly or indirectly sabotaged our chances with recruits.

1fhxyyq,lne08s6,Cal_Aesthetics_Club,"It‚Äôs funny you mention that: In summer of 2022, I had a Burmese roommate and we also discussed the similarities of our respective scripts.

But, yes, there is an explanation for the resemblance:


So basically, there are several different writing systems:

Alphabets(Cyrillic script, Roman script, etc.), Logographic systems(Mandarin, Cantonese, etc.), Abjads(Arabic), Abugidas, etc.

The Telugu script and Burmese script are both abugidas, also known as pseudo-alphabets because, like alphabets, they have vowels and consonants but they still have significant differences from true alphabets. For instance, in abugidas, vowels are typically ‚Äúsubordinate‚Äù to consonants whereas, in true alphabets, all letters are treated equally.

But, to answer your question, the resemblance between the Telugu and Burmese scripts is no coincidence. Long long ago(millennia), there was this script known as the Brahmi script and it was an abugida.

Back then, Sanskrit(which was the lingua franca for a decent chunk of South Asia as well as the liturgical language for the Dharmic religions) was written in the Brahmi script. (Though it‚Äôs currently written with the Devanagari script).

So anyways, as Buddhism and Hinduism spread throughout South Asia, they eventually started to make their way to Southeast Asia. And with those religions came Sanskrit and the Brahmi script(as I said, Sanskrit is the liturgical language of the dharmic religions with the exception of Sikhism). Consequently, many contemporary Southeast Asians adopted the Brahmi script(or one of its close descendants) as well as loanwords from Sanskrit(Thai, Malay and Burmese all have quite a few) and, as time passed, they each branched out into their own unique scripts(Burmese script, Thai script etc).

And of course the same thing happened in South Asia, hence the dozens of different scripts.

TL;DR: Burmese(Sino-Tibetan language) and Telugu(Dravidian language) are not related but their scripts surprisingly are! Thanks to the spread of Buddhism and Hinduism throughout South and Southeast Asia.

I hope that answered your question. Also, just to be clear, I kind of gave an extremely oversimplified answer.",16,1726482801.0,t1_lndyldv

1gndhoe,lwa0cwy,vmanAA738,"The Pac 12 conference exploded last summer because the conference management and school athletic directors failed to get a new media deal done for the conference (it expired at the end of 23-24 school year). The options on the table were a reduced deal with ESPN (who was not interested in the west coast because of the smaller audience compared to the east/midwest/south) or Apple TV (who offered big money but some schools like Washington/Oregon/USC/UCLA didn‚Äôt like the idea of a streaming only media deal and the risk of it failing given that no other conference has anything but standard television deals). 

What ended up happening was that Fox (who controls Big Ten media rights) decided to pounce and offered USC/UCLA money to move to the Big Ten who was willing to take them. Those 2 schools decided they were too ‚Äúbig‚Äù to attach themselves to the west coast and decided to take the money and move. This caused Washington and Oregon to get nervous and decide to try and break away from the pac 12 as well for fear of getting left behind. They cut a deal with Fox and the Big Ten and that triggered a full on collapse of the pac 12. Arizona/ASU/Utah quickly cut a deal to get into the Big 12. 

That left Cal, Stanford, Washington State and Oregon State behind in the dead Pac-12. Cal was facing college sports extinction because if we were out of a major conference, we would not have money to sustain all of our sports including the Olympic ones where Cal is a global leader. Cal and Stanford decided to negotiate together and approached the ACC who was the only major conference suitor left. 11 of the ACC schools were on our side because of the value they saw Calford provided (Miami, Pitt, Louisville, Syracuse, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Georgia Tech, Duke, Wake Forest, Notre Dame and Boston College). That left four holdouts (NC State, UNC, Florida State and Clemson) and one of them needed to flip to admit us.

[A couple in Vacaville was billed $100k each for it.](https://consumers4qualitycare.org/couple-receives-200k-bill-for-rabies-shots/) I priced it out with my UnitedHealthcare and I think I was looking at over $15k. I decided to just take the risk and not get the shot since I saw the dog was still alive and roaming around a couple weeks after getting bitten. With bats it's probably a different story since they can carry rabies and not die but it's a fucking joke to tell someone to get a rabies shot after getting bitten by a stray cat or dog.

1g6bxbq,lshrgtt,[deleted],"Hey mang, I wanted to give some thoughts as An Old**‚Ñ¢.**

Making friends gets progressively harder and takes more work as people grow older. If you‚Äôre a freshman that means you just left high school, where there‚Äôs a smaller pool of people, especially if you‚Äôve lived in the same area for a long time, you probably had more established friendships there and now you‚Äôre experiencing culture shock, basically. It‚Äôs totally understandable, you‚Äôre in a brand new environment, and shit is hard to adapt to, I get it.

To directly answer your questions: yes, people do date and have genuine friendships on Berkeley campus. But it will probably take more effort on your part to make that happen for you. Seek out clubs, find classmates that you vibe with and ask them if they want to hang out outside of class. Even if it‚Äôs just studying in whatever common room is available to you or the library, but you‚Äôll be surprised how open people are to  it and sometimes that‚Äôll lead to camaraderie and genuine friendships. Ask the people you‚Äôre studying with to go grab a bite or a drink (if you‚Äôre of age).

You have to put yourself out there. Not walking around aimlessly on an empty campus trying to spark conversations with randos, but with people in your classes, just set up study groups, or look into clubs that look interesting to you.

If nothing else, seek out free counseling through the school. Because what you‚Äôre feeling is valid, and college IS a big culture shock for a lot of people, and lots of people have trouble with making friends when they first start college. This is not exclusive to Berkeley.

There is a huge range of resources that Cal provides, you should look into them. Don‚Äôt feel bad about feeling the way you do, you‚Äôre gonna do great.",70,1729236436.0,t3_1g6bxbq

It also does take time for many people. I didn‚Äôt make many lasting friendships until my senior year. I had many friends in high school but it was hard in Berkeley to find friends that felt genuine at first. 

I wouldn‚Äôt discount acquaintanceships either, sometimes they develop into friendships as you change and vibe with someone more, and be open to being friends with different types of people.

Dating can be old school - ask to sit next to someone in class/section, dress nice, smile at them, yada yada (graduated in 2018 where apps blah were pretty prevalent already, but old school approach worked on me!).

My family was confronted by a crazed, homeless man in front of our home last week.  He threatened us and was completely out of control and unstable.  The police responded quickly.  They asked if we would like to press charges or have him taken to the psych unit for help.  

Yesterday there was a crazy apparently homeless woman screaming obscenities for a long time on the corner across from my home.  This is typically a quiet North Berkeley residential neighborhood.

1gy6p7u,lyyjgsi,Name_and_full_SSN,"There's been more than one moment in my life where I have called the hotline as a desperate measure.  
The robotic interaction I received, each and every time came **so close** to being the push I needed to step over the edge. It seemed like it was for people who had just learned the definition of suicide, not for those moments from acting on the thought of it.

""This is the best we can do?"" would briefly consume my every thought. I'd get so angry at the sterile commodification of placating people who want to be nothing forever.

When anger turned to numbness, it became a bit of a joke for me when I was younger; I'd occasionally call the hotline to see if they were still a flow chart of platitudes.

I've lived through over a decade of passive suicidality **starting at 13**. I didn't need a stranger to remind me that there are people that would be sad if I stopped existing; I'd been existing out of guilt for **years.** In a world full of cars, trains, and sharp objects, you see the opportunity to violently disappear everywhere, and so that guilt has ample time to define your every thought.

The standard approach to mental health diagnostics and treatment contributed to me nearly taking my life. No one should feel obligated to endorse it.  
Fuck, when I was a kid, the only friends I had shared a thought process:  
""If the doctor hands you the depression/suicidality survey, lie on every question.""  
People scorn ""Better Help"" for their shortcomings, I don't see why this should be any different. People deserve better, and they shouldn't be complacent for what we have now.",1,1732565191.0,t1_lymlj95

There‚Äôs a quote from Infinite Jest that resonates with my experience with suicidal intent:

&gt;The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view... The variable here is the other terror, the fire‚Äôs flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It‚Äôs not desiring the fall; it‚Äôs terror of the flames.

For me, calling the hotline and talking to someone didn‚Äôt change any of the issues in my life, but talking to someone for a little bit was enough for the immediate ‚Äúterror of the flames‚Äù to subside to a manageable level and to be able to think clearly enough to see that I didn‚Äôt need to ‚Äújump‚Äù",1,1732629327.0,t1_lymdfsg

1dn65ud,la6duf5,brianlotfi,"It sounds like you're facing an important decision! Here are some considerations for your situation:

1) Flexibility in Major: Your choice of major can change, and that's perfectly okay! What matters most is exploring your interests and aligning them with your long-term career goals.

2) Looking Ahead with AI and Robotics:
Beyond the university's name, consider how advancements like AI and robotics will impact medicine over the next 20-30- even 40 yrs. For instance, while traditional eye surgeon's useful years to perform surgery is approximately 10 years, AI-powered robots can perform eye surgeries like cornea transplants more consistently and efficiently, operating round the clock. They do not get tired and make fewer mistakes on average (hopefully! At least that is the end goal!)

3) Choosing the Right School: There is no right or wrong school. Your decision should be based on visiting &amp; researching each school to find the best fit for **your** personality and learning style. Berkeley may be a great fit for some but not for all. I came to Berkeley from a private school and my experience was a lot different between undergrad and grad school. Obviously, you will check their financial aid packages to better manage your education costs. You do not want too much debt for undergrad education if your goal is med school. 

4) campus Culture: consider the campus culture and extracurricular activities that align with your interests and personal growth. 

5) Campus subculture: Remember, Berkeley leans far-left politically, but in recent years, they've strayed from their commitment to freedom of speech. Instances like the uproar over right-wing speakers visiting campus illustrate this shift. Once a bastion of free speech, my Alma Mater has seen some students actively silence any opinion that opposes their groupthink. It seems some have veered toward extreme (left &amp; right) ideologies, abandoning common sense in the process. UCB is no longer #1 public school last I checked. 

However, your most crucial task is to consider the future of your chosen career and how AI could impact it. Majors such as MBA may become obsolete in the near future, and professions like doctors and lawyers may see reduced demand over the next two decades.",0,1719302945.0,t3_1dn65ud

1dn65ud,la8s5x2,Dull-Law3229,"Accepted into UC Berkeley and UCI. Rejected from UCLA.

UC Irvine is undeniably much nicer and more posh than UC Berkeley. You would save a lot of money on living expenses also, and it's much safer. UC Berkeley students are also notoriously unattractive. 

All else being equal, UC Berkeley is wayyyy more prestigious. When I was in China, everyone knew my school. How many doors it would open depends on industry and who you are speaking to. It's like the difference being ""I graduated from Harvard"" vs ""I graduated from college"". Sometimes it matters or helps, sometimes it doesn't.

On the flip side, I would recommend you live further from home and not stay with your folks. I understand the appeal but now is the time to explore the world, even if it's still in California just to see how big it is. That being said, you could also do that in medical school or a masters program when you are older and more mature. 

My friend who transferred from UCI to UCB thought UCI was easier so it's much easier to get a higher GPA which is important for medical school. I also knew a lot of people from UC Berkeley who transferred to UCLA, which seems like a happy medium. I actually loved Berkeley and wouldn't have wanted to have stayed in SoCal.

But we're still around, putting on events in your communities. They might not get posted on the CAA website, but they'll go out in email newsletters or get posted to Facebook.

1fyr2wc,lqzpmxg,InfernalWedgie,"That's so weird that none of the chapters have watch parties up there. Here's my experience setting up watch parties where I am:

1. Find out when and where it'll be broadcast. 
2. Call bars and restaurants to see if they carry the channel. Don't take their word for it when it's a niche channel like ACC plus or whatever. Ask them to check their TV (I've shown up for our reservation only to find the place didn't have the damned channel.
3. Post event to FB and CAA.
4. Hope people show up. 

What I would recommend is nailing down some spots that have ACC Network, ESPN, and FS1. If you find a magical unicorn of a bar with a full liquor license, good food, and ALL those channels, *make that your forever sports home*. 

Get in touch with someone in the local chapter. DM them asking if they are planning on a game party. If they don't already have plans, tell them where the game is being shown and promise to be a butt in a seat wearing blue and gold. Ask them to rally the troops so you have a cheering section.

This, for better or worse, is how volunteering starts. Someone has to have the cojones to just show up.

It is like a club at Berkeley which is run by folks who volunteered their time and effort. Each events are planned and coordinated by the volunteers, and if there is any funding, it's almost always reimbursement for these events which is a separate paperwork and has a somewhat tight limit on the amount.

I noticed your comment that you want to tap into the Cal professional network, and I think that is a fantastic idea especially in today's economy, but quickly realized this should be an initiative by the main CAA office.

The main CAA office in Berkeley are also run by a lean number of staff from what I can tell, starting with responding to various emails from the chapters and website maintenance, especially regarding promoting the events and providing a path for those who want to join.

My observation is the main CAA office could use a lot more support as well so that they have the time and funding to promote the professional networking events and others that aren't really in the domain of local chapters -- the staff are very good, but I am seeing signs of being overworked, and if anything, underfunded.",22,1728389118.0,t3_1fyr2wc

Here's my experience with the 4 alumni club chapters since graduating:

- Hong Kong, very heavy with the big alumni events. Annual Berkeley Gala where the chancellor, vice chancellor, VIP and standout students (HK Olympians, Golden Overtones, Oski, etc. fly out to attend). Monthly Happy Hours/Networking, often with other T25 US Universities + Oxbridge. Very few casual events - when the football team is good they may have viewing parties. Facebook and email are main communcation.

- Shanghai - apparently people (both job recruiters and also people faking being Berkeley grads) keep trying to infiltrate the WeChat group chats and pose as Berkeley grads. Lots and lots and lots of industry centric networking events. Regular Happy Hours, but very little attempts to connect with anyone, just a bunch of people looking to move up and gain a bigger group of contacts. About a decade ago, had more young alum, social events. Share the big events title (Berkeley Gala) with Hong Kong. There's at least 4 diffferent wechat groups that I'm a member of through the Shanghai alumni association

- Houston - small and at the time I lived in Houston, only occasionally active - did some high school recruiting for Berkeley at the very big high school college fairs

And it's not simply fundraising / begging letters, either (which is what Cal primarily sends out to alumni when the campus gets their current addresses). 

Instead, the Harvard / Stanford material is really interesting and informative, lots of well written coverage of current campus life, university highlights, interesting profiles of alumni and what they're doing, invitations to events, lectures, gatherings, parties...what they convey to their alumni is that you're always part of our university family and we want to keep you in touch with our community, regardless of whether you're a big donor.

4. I'm not offended at your comment. Berkeley has some of the most beautiful historical buildings. At least a couple that are literal castle. Property value is so darn high it is one of the most expensive places to buy in the **world**.

1ch49uz,l260m2t,[deleted],"You have a good point, there are more pressing issues and things that should be funded at Berkeley rather than CS. I am not pushing for a high acceptance rate, I simply want one that isn't this terrible. 1.9 is absolutely unacceptable. Yes the world doesn't need that much CS majors, but it also can't function with no CS majors.  The amount of people we can import from different countries to fill in the CS shortage is hitting a limit. 

And for a school like Berkeley who is ranked #1 in CS, and is the only public UC in the bay area (unless u count Davis, but that isn't anywhere close to SFBA), it should not be having these ivy league like numbers. This school is a gateway to lift people out of poverty, and especially those who have to stay in the Bay Area to take care of vulnerable family. The CS major can singlehandedly change ones life here. Sure there's SJSU, CSUEB, and SFSU, which are amazing schools, but Berkeley has so much CS resources, professors, previous research, alumni connections, it would be amazing to host more CS majors here.

Also being like ""everyone else is underpaid and making 50k, so why should it be easier"" is just NIMBY mindset lmao, not every CS major is lined up at a FAANG/Startup company to sell their souls, and blaming that other people are underpaid because of CS majors is not correct lol. People do research in the field, contribute to open source communities, create languages to solve problems. The website your writing on wouldn't be possible without CS majors.

I spent 2 years in the military (medical discharge) learning to be an electrician and radar specialist for advanced weapons systems. I was contracted to be a Tomahawk missile tech before my health saw me part ways with the Navy. All the same, I've carried our motto, ""On time on target,"" forward.

I spent a decade working as a baker before attending Berkeley for my degree. I learned time management, inventory control, have an internal clock now that is precise to the second, and my eye for consistency and quality control is second to none from eyeballing large batches of product for imperfections.

I got my Bachelor's at Berkeley in Film &amp; Media Studies honing that critical eye with documentary and film studies.

Now, I'm in a role where I detect suspicious patterns in customer accounts and behavior to protect people from identity theft and mail fraud at a company with almost 1500 locations around the globe.

I directly attribute my ability to pick out patterns so quickly to my time in the military and fast food. People who want to learn and apply skills from one place to another absolutely can. You just can't be thinking of the place you wind up as your forever home. Get in, take what you need, get out.

1eb8od0,letmej1,Rich_Ad6234,"Good for you.  Based on my experience riding for longer than you, though admittedly both of us did most of our riding in eras when bike lanes were far less common,  I‚Äôd say that I do not feel safe riding in a way that has no impact on car traffic.  Several good books on this topic from the 80s &amp; 90s, but in my two examples, broken glass in the gutter and upcoming left turns, there are certainly ways to do it without entering a traffic lane, but they aren‚Äôt as safe.  Taking the lane by riding in the middle and acting as a car (albeit slower) for a short distance (say half a block) is generally safer because you are visible and predictable.  Staying out of traffic by riding on the sidewalk, in the gutter, or going in and out of crosswalks to make left turns causes more unexpected movements for cars and raises the likelihood of bike pedestrian collisions.   In these scenarios a car will be delayed by ~15-30 seconds as I make it to the end of the block for my left turn and go at 15 rather than 25 mph.  They get annoyed, but they don‚Äôt hit you.   When you pop out from the side, that‚Äôs when you get a right hook, or similar collision.  

Obviously you feel differently in your own experience, which is fine, I‚Äôm not going to argue with you at all, but I will post this here so that others don‚Äôt think that bikes in the middle of the traffic lane are doing that for their own amusement, or to slow the car down, or to claim their ‚Äúrights‚Äù.  They are usually doing it because it is the safest most efficient way for us all to share the road.

This is an interesting way to look at death. He seemed like a real inspiration. Had he stayed, I would've loved to learn from him.

I also must add that I wore a helmet when I blacked out and crashed on an e-board leaving my community college campus. I didn't experience anything negative nor positive, just, nothing. Then I came back out of it on campus wandering (no idea how I got back to campus), noticing I was covered in blood, and eventually got taken to the hospital.

His view on death is similar to mine, and yet, he spent his live devoted to work to influence lives that exist even after his passing. This is a wonderful article, and he passed away next to caring and loving individuals.

And if it is just the reputation of being tough, then I believe my point stands. In particular, whereas I agree stuff like more REUs/student population at private universities afford them more opportunity, I'm confused how harsh grading is the preferred method to counter this, rather than organically harder coursework, to build a similar reputation of toughness",1,1715892216.0,t1_l4cgi0o
1csw18z,l4d43lr,SavageCyclops,"These private universities will host more events for their their relatively smaller student body, better connecting students with industry internships as students have less peer-competition at career fairs.

Providing more of these services to fewer students is going to be more expensive for the university.

These schools like Stanford have reputations of grad inflation, not deflation. They don‚Äôt need to have rigorous coursework because they have the resources to attract smart undergrad students and the resources to get students into prestigious jobs in industry.

Moreover, these prestigious private institutions maximize prestige by letting in as few students as possible to be seen as more ‚Äúexclusive/selective‚Äù and by operating their institutions as hedge funds to keep the machine running. Harvard now has 2 administrators per 1 student while stating they could double enrollment with no impact on educational outcomes. Most money from these schools come from donations and their endowment, not student tuition. On the other hand, UC schools have the primary goal of being a public service. UCB could create artificial prestige by lowering enrollment massively, incentivize donations from alum to better the odds of getting into the now-exclusive school, and operate more as a hedge fund to keep the lights on rather than relying on tuition. However, UCB making this shift would have the school operate more of a hedge fund and school of the elite, rather than a public service to give a good education to a broader population.

I think grade deflation is a way UCB can have both prestige and still act as a public service. This comes at the expense of dealing with grade deflation as a student, but there is no free lunch in the world. If one wants both a prestigious institution and grade inflation, there are many private institutions across the country which can offer that experience. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for a public uni to do this for the reasons listed above.",1,1715893843.0,t1_l4czixr

When their leadership cares enough about Gazan's getting killed and cities (including hospitals) being leveled to totally surrender themselves and their brigades, and releases any hostages still alive to the Red Cross, then I'll consider giving a fuck shit.

Dude, stop coping. This is very clearly something that a diabetic dropped by accident, probably because they were having an attack. It has zero to do with drug use and would be useless for that anyway.

And for projects that list 9-11 hours, you are right in that 11hrs is the maximum that they will assign. It depends on the professor, but most will have lighter weeks that may be less than 9 hours/week. Still, most weeks will likely be at the maximum hours/week listed. 

My experience with professors is that they will ask at every weekly meeting if you were able to fulfill the 9-11hrs of work that week, and if you tell them that you didn't have enough to do, they may give you more work to do  for the following week to make sure they are hitting the 9-11hr/week mark.",3,1725060062.0,t1_lkqkvvj

1f4gmeh,lkt3hyj,ohboy42,"No problem! To answer a few of your follow-ups here: 

9-11 hours can certainly feel like a lot, especially if your schedule is already busy. I may shy away from URAP if you already have a full academic schedule plus another time-demanding club or extracurricular. Secondly, there is probably a low chance that a professor will respond to your cold email, but it doesn't hurt to try. Generally, the reason why professors decide to recruit Undergrad RAs through the URAP program is for the specific reason that they don't want to fend off a bunch of emails. I say, give it a shot and see what happens.

And so on your point about paid positions-- the main thing to understand is that a lab can be different from a URAP. Typically, labs have funding from outside industry or research orgs, or a significant grant. So there sort of a situation where a not all URAP projects are labs, but some URAP project are labs. However, going through the URAP program will never mean paid positions. What your friends are probably talking about is large, funded lab. The applications for RA in these types of labs typically act a lot more like a job application, and behave a lot more like a job (and you get paid like a job too). The thing to recognize is that the students who are getting these positions are not only competing with each other but also with another hypothetical 100 students who will offer to do the same job for free. Thus, to 'think of yourself as worthy' of a paid RA position, you must have a specific skill set or experience that is explicitly valuable for the lab and that no other student can offer. Beyond this, you will also be competing with alumni and others from the general job market. 

Anecdotally, the only people that I've known to get paid RA positions as an undergraduate had 1. a strong established relationship with the professor, 2. experience already working for that professor for free through an Undergraduate RA program, and 3. were a superstar in their field and far far beyond the average skill level of their major.",5,1725096195.0,t1_lkt1fhm

This is only passed by Stanford's capital raised of $73.5 billion. So while Berkeley has created the most successful start up companies of any university, Stanford start ups have in total raised more capital then any university.

The rivalry continues.

1dc32m2,l7zjit9,DefinitelyNotAliens,"The 2004, fall total enrollment of grad and undergrad was 32,800. It's now 33,078 undergrad, with 45,057 students enrolled.

The student body has grown by over 12,000 students in the last 20 years.

Berkeley is 114k people, roughly. In 2000, the population was 103k.

Over the last 20 years, Berkeley has approved 7000ish new homes, which sounds great! But... some of those (likely nearly all) likely involved removing 3 units to build 15. Remove 200 to add 350. And, approvals =/= completed. Berkeley also had a housing shortage prior to this. California as a whole has not kept pace with housing demand for the last 30 years, we aren't actually adding enough housing to meet demand. It's why the People's Park project was a big deal.

Yes, it's been a problem for decades. Yes, it existed in your parent's time. Yes, it's getting worse.

It's not a recent problem. Nearly every city in the state has had insufficient housing stock added over the last few decades. When your population grows by 3% but your housing stock by 1%, after a few decades, the disparity, which had been small, has grown out of control. We're in the out of control portion.

Back in 2004, the total cost of attendance, tuition and everything was around 16k. It's now like 43k. The average studio was 816 a month, the average 2 bed was 1600 a month. 100% of students who applied for housing received a spot in campus housing.

The costs have increased exponentially because the housing shortage is like 20-30% statewide. Berkeley is the same. And if we need 20% more housing, costs go up by more than 20%. It doubles, triples. People who would normally want a private room end up in triples and people who are willing to live in triples get no housing because people willing to bunk 3 to a room aren't as good of renters on paper as those who will do single occupancy.

The squeeze has gotten worse.",9,1718038617.0,t1_l7xlkv9
1dc32m2,l7waq7p,furioe,"Can you describe a situation where an EFC of $0 is not enough? The site doesn‚Äôt seem to explain this.

I personally get about 30k with EFC of 0. Tuition is about 15k. Estimated food and housing is about 18k. Assuming rent is about 1k w/ roommate and that you spend conservatively on your food, it‚Äôs more or less correct. Then ther‚Äôs estimated cost of books, supplies, transportation which I personally feel I didn‚Äôt need except my initial purchase of a laptop and tablet. Maybe includes phone plan. I will leave it at 1k. Personal expense is at 2.7k.

That leaves me 5.7k under. Considering work-study or part time job, this cost can be mostly covered and you can take a small loan.

1dc32m2,l7x03cx,Ekotar,"First off, when I was an undergrad I had EFC $0 and did exactly what you describe, but that doesn't mean others are able to; people's circumstances vary. 

I'm not moving the goalposts, to quote my original claim:

&gt; the financial aid process for LI individuals does not include enough money to afford housing and tuition in all cases, even with an EFC of $0.

I didn't say ""in most cases"", I said ""in all cases"" -- all I claimed was that there are *some* cases in which EFC $0 support doesn't cover enough for someone to afford both housing and tuition -- if someone has dependents or debt, those are circumstances in which EFC $0 support may be insufficient to cover necessary living costs.

If you'd like to take an *unusually* strict definition of ""afford housing and tuition"" in order to feel you won the argument, you're welcome to do that, but you misunderstanding my original claim and me clarifying it is not ""moving the goalposts"". Neither a question of prior debt - consumer, mortgage, medical, etc - nor of dependents is a non-sequitur, they are both directly relevant to one's ability to afford housing.

So it's the perfect area for people to do sus shit to bikes and not get noticed. So PSA, don't use those racks!

Is it that interesting? It would be understood to be the Alpha, where the Omega is hidden by the Fiat Lux scrollwork.

Technically ""the Alpha and the Omega"" is an ancient Greek metaphor (the beginning and end, or entirety/whole, of something). But I have to imagine that to middle-brow viewers of the late 1800s, ""Fiat Lux"" would be a direct quotation from Genesis (not just a reference to enlightenment), and ""the Alpha and the Omega"" would be a reference to Revelations (not just to the sum of all knowledge).",3,1716654242.0,t1_l5kuoft

The ""A"" was intended to represent ""the beginning of wisdom"". No mention of concluding with Omega. 

Excerpt: *""In 1884, the Orders of the Board of Regents stated, ‚ÄúThe corporate seal of the Regents shall be of the size of a Mexican dollar, and the legend around the rim shall be: ‚ÄúUniversity of California--Organized 1868.' And the motto shall be: \`Let there be light.' ‚Äù*

*In 1903, President Benjamin Ide Wheeler was authorized by the Regents to procure and submit to the board designs for a new seal. The present official corporate seal of the University, designed by Tiffany and Company, was adopted by the Regents on August 9, 1910. The seal has the words ‚ÄúThe Seal of The University of California, 1868‚Äù printed around the rim of a circle. Within the circle is an open book with the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù at the top of one page.

RedBubble might have a system where you provide the digital artwork, and they print and mail it. Probably less profit to the artist, but also less work.

&gt; phase two of the #Escalate movement heats up at u.c. berkeley with a construction site set on fire in broad daylight. this was done in retaliation for u.c.pd's violent assaults on vulnerable student demonstrators and to punish the university of kkkalifornia system for supporting the genocidal zionist-Israel entity. this was an autonomous initiative in concert with the current WEEK OF ACTION currently underway: operation campus flood.

&gt; call it mutual aid

&gt; at one p.m. this a f t e r n o o n, we torched large portions of a construction site in the middle of u.c. berkeley campus. OPERATION CAMPS FLOOD on u.c.b. kkkampus has began with:

&gt; - successful looting of a u.c.b supply building of thousands of dollars,
&gt; - the fire bombing of a u.c.b cop car,
&gt; - the experimental burning of dry grass hills on the interior of campus
&gt; - the torching of a building on the perimeter of the campus
and now
&gt; - the arson of a construction site (mostly construction materials, wood pallets, and massive dry bush area

&gt; x this was done to further retaliate against the u.c.pd for attacking students at u.c.s.c. and u.c.l.a.

&gt; x this was done as an autonomous (self-directed act) in concert with anyone who shows out to create liberatoratory _destruction_ until the u.c. system completely divests from the genocidal ""israeli"" settler nation-building project

&gt; x this was done in solidarity with all displaced peoples who were removed from people's park - criminalized survivors of genocide HERE

&gt; x this was done in retaliation for the u.c. berkeley administration's attack on the houseless community of berkely - in retaliation for stealing the land called people's park

&gt; lastly

&gt; ‚ô° this was done on father's day for all the palestinian fathers who have lost their children at the hands of the zionist and amerikkkan settler states

&gt; ‚ô° this was done on father's day for all the black and brown fathers who have lost their children at the hands of u.s.a. police forces in berkeley

Did you support when the UC contracted over 1000 cops from agencies across the state to sweep people out of their homes in People's Park, destroy some of the only personal property they had, cordon off entire blocks of the city and institute illegal ID checks for residents, illegally and without notice tow personal vehicles inside their exclusion zone, establish a fortified compound around what's been a public space for all of our lifetimes, and arrest or brutalize peaceful protestors sometimes seemingly at random? Can you argue in good faith that that amalgamation of tactics wasn't designed to overwhelm any who might push back against that action with fear of deadly force? That is, by definition, terrorism. But I bet because it was a state agency doing it for a cause you likely support, you'll sing a completely different tune even though by every metric, from property damage to direct physical and psychological harm to individuals, that action was far more harmful than some half-assed fire setting. And of course that's all without even getting into what good ""peaceful protest"" is against bodies which have no desire to change their current policies. BDS is literally illegal for institutions like UC in CA. Peaceful, non-disruprive protest has literally zero chance of changing anything. If that's the limit of your support, then you're either too naive/ignorant to understand the likely outcomes or, and I consider this much more likely, you're just another virtue signaling liberal invoking the notion of ""support"" without anything meaningful behind it.

1dhlzx5,l92ry07,CocoLamela,"I frankly don't care what you believe, you're clearly unhinged. Tactics like arson and literal criminal activity are actually the part that won't change anything. Malcolm would be unknown without Martin.  

UC divestment won't change a damn thing for the Palestinians either.  Equating the People's Park dilemma with the Gaza protests is super disingenuous and is effectively whataboutism. UC's strongarm tactics there weren't acceptable and I don't support them. I do support the redevelopment plan including permanent supportive housing and significant investment on homeless services, in addition to the student housing. Ultimately, the will of the many outweighs the plight of the few affected by the closure of the park. People's Park had become a drug den and homeless encampment, not the community and cultural space that we have known our whole life. Anyone who wanted to maintain that status quo does not actually care about the well-being of the people living there and are the ultimate virtue signalers.

In our democratic system of laws, the state is allowed to utilize these tactics when necessary. The monopoly of violence is what keeps order.  People who try to upset that social contract with their own violence will always be put down in a functioning society.  You have to get plurality buy-in before you can change the system.  These pro-Palestine ""protesters"" are the miniscule minority looking for publicity and no one else agrees with you.

You've got no understanding of (or probably just no interest in challenging) how power asymmetries affect concepts like ""buy-in."" For example, did you know there's currently no developer attached to the ""supportive housing"" part of the People's Park project? Of course that hasn't stopped the university from invoking it in their press releases and public statements in order to appeal to vaguely well-meaning but generally uninterested and sheltered liberals. And thanks to the size of their microphone compared to any dissenting voices, guess whose narrative shapes public perception more? I could make similar arguments for every other example in here, but frankly that would probably be a waste of time and effort. 

You don't seem to have any discernible position other than defending whatever arbitrary side you like more. You don't approve of the tactics used in the People's Park case, but you support the entire project and maintain the moral right of the state or powerful institutions aligned with it to exclusively apply those tactics? You care about the plight of the Palestinian people but ongoing collaboration with and support from the premier public university system in the world makes no meaningful difference, even though the state of CA seems to think otherwise given theyve literally made halting that support illegal? Wishy-washy nonsense you can only get away with because you don't actually have to convince anyone of anything to get your way. Another classic sign of occupying the privileged conservative position in any conflict. The status quo of gentrification locally and support for settler colonial projects abroad continuing as is is apparently a win for you. 

As far as I can tell, ""the situation"" is that a plurality if not majority of people, overrepresented in positions of power, think like you and won't have your minds changed by any sufficiently peaceful rhetoric. That's just easier to dismiss after pretending to have to weigh it seriously. I don't know how specifically to fix that, but if some people decide trying to make it inconvenient or expensive enough through direct action to continue on that course is the most promising strategy, well, conversations like this one make it hard for me to tell them they're any more wrong than those who hope to convince oppressive and exploitative institutions to stop acting in their own self interest. If you don't like that assessment, then maybe take some of the time you've spent trying to lecture me and write a letter to the  Chancellor or the UC Board of Regents or Governor Newsom's office explaining why, given the actions some people are committed to taking, it's not in their material interest (since morality is demonstrably irrelevant to them) to continue supporting the Israeli government or firms aligned with them. If they're so much more reasonable then they should be easier to convince to change their ways than the people starting fires and sabotaging construction equipment.",1,1718671257.0,t1_l92ry07
1dhlzx5,l9358tq,CocoLamela,"I don't think my position is arbitrary. It represents a reasonable middle ground. I acknowledge there have been abuses of power and the scales are tipped against institutional change. That being said, occupation and destruction of property won't change that. Low level violence won't change that. There is a difference between civil disobedience and pointless, immature criminal activity. 

If the elected and appointed representatives of UC and other positions of power cannot be convinced by reasonably peaceful rhetoric,  maybe you should consider the fact that it just isn't a very good idea. The concept that this is some kind of anti-Muslim kabal or conspiracy on the part of the state is silly. This is also the most progressive and anti-racist public university system and State government anywhere in the world. If you can't acknowledge the weaknesses in your position, you'll never be able to convince anyone of anything.

And, for what it's worth, I actually did know that UC has not identified a developer for the supportive housing project. But the project won't be able to advance without that.

They are fighting from among civilian populations without uniforms (aka warcrimes) and are not providing shelter from a war \*they started\* despite having hundreds of miles of tunnels. They are also holding innocent civilians including children hostage and refuse to release them and turn down all ceasefire offers. Donating money to UNRWA or any UN organization or anyone working in Gaza - is donating to Hamas. It is enriching the terror machine and Hamas leaders who are already worth billions thanks to your generous donations. There is no shortage of aid going to Gaza. There is failure of the UN to effectively distribute aid and there's Hamas who steal aid and sell it at a profit (em, they get it for free that's what stealing means).

I don‚Äôt personally believe the British mandate or the creation of Israel should‚Äôve happened at all, and the last 75 years of bloody conflict proves my point, but the genie is out of the bottle, and a one state solution is impossible without the destruction of the other side. 

You also can‚Äôt realistically point the finger entirely at Hamas when Netanyahu and Israel‚Äôs government has also been charged by the ICC for war crimes. Ultimately, it‚Äôs the leadership of both sides that are allowing this genocide to occur and the civilians are the ones caught in the middle. That‚Äôs why when I hear people trying to argue that there aren‚Äôt any innocents in this conflict I thoroughly roll my eyes. Netanyahu should be tried at The Hague, along with the rest of his right wing government, and the same goes for Hamas as well. 

That‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs good to donate directly to Palestinian families and refugees trying to get out.

1dhlzx5,l91mlrk,nyyca,"Let's go to the beginning. Why do you think the British Mandate or the creation of Israel shouldn't have happened at all? I assume it is because you think the land was Arab land. Why do you think that? If you think that, then I assume you think Jews have no claim to the land and Arabs do? This would involve ignoring the undeniable history of the Jews in the land of Israel and their continuous presence is the land for thousands of years despite cruel prosecution from all the colonizers and empires who had control of this land for 2000 years. 

Would love to hear your answers to these questions. To recap: Why do you think it was Arab land and why do you think Jews have no claim to this land. 

Here's a tip - when you say ""75 years"" you expose your ignorance. I don't blame you for only relying on the misinformation you are fed, but I am saying it exposes you. First of all it's been 76 years since the creation of the state of Israel, so there's that. 76 years since the local Arabs (they were not called Palestinians back then - you are welcome to fact check) were offered a state which they never ever had before. The Arabs as whole, because they were all acting together refused this offer and started a genocidal war against the Jews. They lost that war which is kinda on them - they could have had a thriving state for 76 years if they wanted to. You cannot blame the Jews for not wanting to die and for winning a war they did not start. 

The west bank and Gaza were under Jordanian and Egyptian control and there was very little interaction with the Jews. No ""occupation"" no ""oppression."" The only interaction the Arabs had with the Jews other than shooting at them from over the walls in Jerusalem is with the Arabs who stayed in Israel in 1948. You know, the ones who are now 20% of Israel's population. They got full citizenship and enjoy more human rights than they would in any Arab state. So not really a conflict there. While the Jews, including my family were ethnically cleansed from all Arab countries and territories. Places where they lived for thousands of years. 

If you want to talk just about the bloody conflict then it's not 75 years either. It's hundreds of years. Violence against Jews is evident in the Quran.There's a long list of massacres throughout the Arab world since the 7th century and of course there 's a long list of massacres in the land of Israel as well. 

I have opposed Netanyahu ever since I can remember and would love to see him gone, but he was not charged by the ICC for war crimes. There was a request to issue an arrest. Notice that this is not even issuing an arrest just a request to do so. Either way, Israel, the United States, Russia and China don‚Äôt accept the court‚Äôs jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and other crimes. 

Finally, Israel is \*not\* targeting civilians and certainly not targeting children. It however has to defend itself after October 7th. Do you have another suggestion on how to fight a fanatic jihadi  terror organization that vows to annihilate Israel and commit October 7th again and again? I'm all ears. Israel has taken extreme measure to protect civilians in the most difficult urban warfare in history against an enemy that is interested in maximizing the deaths of it's own people. Hamas says so openly.  I suggest you listen to this US military expert: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqxzscalX2E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqxzscalX2E)",0,1718652201.0,t1_l91e4vc

When committing an action, one must take into account all that may be hurt by actions committed.

Harm towards local community, whether it be economic or physical, does NOT facilitate a crucial connection point.

Importantly, action should not be committed in largely communal areas; the local populace is not your enemy.

I woke up in the morning, and was first in line to vote at the Unit 3 polling station. I cast my ballot and felt great all day. 

Then night came and our building for some reason decided to have a watch party for the election. As the results came rolling in, everyone‚Äôs mood soured and people started screaming randomly in the streets. Then when it was finally called, people erupted. I remember walking around (as a naive freshman that didn‚Äôt know any better) and seeing tons of people and cars milling around. 

Then people let out their anger in bad ways that night: people started tagging buildings with left list graffiti. Then more people started marching. Then some more people started bashing in store windows and looting (I distinctly remember seeing the former Center street Starbucks get completely smashed up). I was kind of in a trance at a loss for what to do and I took extreme danger by following random mobs around. Don‚Äôt do this in any circumstance. 

The next day was arguably worse. I had morning class and when I got on campus loads of people were just sitting and standing around looking depressed and sad. There were many people shouting and chanting things that came from a place of true despair. Mass emails from the chancellor were sent trying to cushion things for everyone, lots of exams and assignments were postponed or cancelled.

Loads of anti Trump protests, right wing speakers would constantly get invited to speak on campus only to be hit with demonstrations from students and protesters (one of those I distinctly remember‚Äî my 18 year old brain was not prepared to see someone light and fire a Molotov cocktail into the crowds of people on Upper Sproul), constantly going to class through highway crash barriers and crowd control fencing lining campus walkways with surveillance helicopters buzzing above in the sky. I had a lot of mental problems that year because I was not prepared to go from a quiet suburban high school environment the year before to that charged environment the next.

Repeal of Prop 13 would pretty much immediately remedy this. My neighbor pays $2700/year in property taxes. His dump of a place makes that in a single month and the rest is pretty much pure profit. Reassessing his taxes to the value of the property  would mean he would sell immediately.",1,1718575840.0,t1_l8bfnls

That shell (house) that is bought by an investor and perpetually rented is a house that had been withdrawn from the owner-occupant market. 

And those working professionals renting it means they won't get out of the rental market, or build equity. So the housing pressure on others further down the economic ladder who can't pay as much in rent, will unnecessarily increase.

This problem has hit hard in several parts of the country and it is terrible for housing policy overall, because the private equity investors are not creating any new housing through it--they're simply shifting housing from family ownership/occupancy to perpetual rentals. If they were instead putting their money into financing new construction...

In Berkeley there are several big for-profit housing developments that have ALL their city permits and approvals, own their land / sites...and haven't started construction, in some cases for years after getting their permits.

However, that is because the first disabled students really admitted to campus (who were housed in the infirmary, not dorms) and their attendants who helped them around campus would sometimes sneak out at night with sackrete and sledgehammers and break up curbs and install curb cuts on the paths they used. They would go around campus and called themselves the Rolling Quads (one was quadriplegic) and bust up curbs. At least one got arrested for getting drunk at a bar and urinating in an alley in downtown.

I love that we once had a chaotic good roving gang of disabled students who sometimes installed their own curb cuts so they could get to class easier. Even had a name for themselves.

It's not on campus, but one of those students went on to be a major disability rights activist and after his death the Smithsonian put his wheelchair in the museum. Also, every single curb cut in the city and on campus is sort of a memorial, in a way. Can think about our past chaotic good students and their nighttime curb cut installations.

John Galen Howard did prepare one concept showing a two bedroom apartment on each floor of the Campanile (with multiple windows at each level, so the tower would have looked like an office building), but it's not clear how or why that was commissioned or whether it was ever a serious idea.

Howard was always experimenting with alternative ideas to see what they would look like. For example, he did a design for Sather Gate that looked like a Roman triumphal arch, and another one that looked like the portico to a Greek temple, before settling on a Beaux Arts concept.",16,1729108137.0,t1_ls88tly

Howard's papers are in the University Archives, and I would guess somewhere buried in a musty folder there might be a letter or note or memo about alternative Campanile concepts. It would be an interesting research project for someone. Much of what Howard planned / designed wasn't actually built because of cost reasons. For example, the north front of Doe Library was supposed to be full of terraces, heroic sculpture, etc. The Campanile did end up with just unfinished bare concrete walled intermediate floors initially, so things like apartments could have been ""value engineered"" out by the University's budget people. 

At this point, I don't know why he did that particular drawing, but I also don't know of any specific record that the University was seriously considering putting apartments there. Interesting sidelight, when Howard designed the Campanile there were already a number of similar clock towers elsewhere in the United States, some of which did have multiple windows per floor, with the middle floors used for offices. Howard would have definitely seen the second, and possibly seen the first, below.

Daniels &amp; Fisher Tower in Denver, which looks the most like Howard's alternative drawing: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniels\_%26\_Fisher\_Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniels_%26_Fisher_Tower)

And Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower in Manhattan. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan\_Life\_Insurance\_Company\_Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Life_Insurance_Company_Tower)

Fun fact on the side, there is actually one apartment in the Campanile right now. It's a little suite which functions as office for the University Carillonist. It's a comfortable little space like a combined living room / office. I think there is a bathroom, too, although not necessarily a formal bedroom. Can read about it here: [https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/06/10/retiring-university-carillonist-jeff-davis-reflects-on-the-coolest-job-in-the-world/](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/06/10/retiring-university-carillonist-jeff-davis-reflects-on-the-coolest-job-in-the-world/)

Here's part of his recollection: *""Most memorable for me was following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. I was living in San Francisco and on the road home when the quake happened.¬†By the time I arrived at the toll plaza, the Bay Bridge was closed.¬†I returned to the tower, which still had power and was utterly empty. I went to the observation level as evening came on, and I could see fires in downtown Berkeley and in the Marina district of San Francisco. There were no lights anywhere, except for one bulb near the Ferry Building that stood in stark contrast to everything around it.¬†I was unable to return home for two days, so that little apartment in the tower proved very helpful for a stranded bell-ringer.""*",6,1729110000.0,t1_ls95uxd

Someone should do a social history of Sproul Plaza someday (!). The people who planned it in the 1950s really had no clue it would end up the way it did. They envisioned it as a fairly sedate entrance plaza where the occasional spirit rally, etc. might be held. This was all well prior to the Free Speech Movement.",6,1729134740.0,t1_ls9h942

1g51trp,lsbhsgc,OppositeShore1878,"I'm not sure of the exact year Sproul Plaza was built / opened, but the overall sequence was:

* UC bought up the east side of the northernmost block of Telegraph slowly. In late 30s the buildings there were demolished and Sproul Hall (then just the ""Administration Building"" was constructed. For years it faced on Telegraph Avenue as a street, outside Sather Gate.
* Starting after World War II, and into the 50s, the campus planned for a vast expansion to the south, including relocating the whole Student Union complex from what are Stephens Hall / Philosophy Building today, to the two city blocks west of Sproul Hall. 
* Land there was gradually bought up, and the businesses and buildings on the west side of Telegraph and along Bancroft demolished in the late 50s. Only the Dance Facility (originally a Unitarian Church) survives from that earlier era. Student Union and what's now Golden Bear Center were built first. I think that is the time that Sproul Plaza was built as well, and the street formally closed, probably right at the beginning of the 60s. 
* Eshleman Hall (the previous Eshleman, not the current building on the same site) was then added by the mid-60s to form a third side of what's now Lower Sproul Plaza. The area to the west, where Zellerbach is now, was for a while a rec sports playing field. 
* Zellerbach Hall was finished / opened for the UC Centennial in 1968, completing the complex.
* Oh, and Alumni House was part of the plan as well, intentionally included in the complex. The Alumni Association offices had previously been in Stephens Union with the ASUC offices. Alumni House was planned to be not just CAA offices, but also a ""living room"" on campus for visiting alumni, essentially an adjunct to the nearby Student Union serving the social interests of the older generation(s).

Research isn't handed to you for free, that much is true. You do have to actively pursue it and be proactive in finding it. However I wouldn't call it difficult to get. With every teacher having a lab, the large national laboratory right up the hill, and startups abound, there are many opportunities to have. I believe in about 2-3 dozen transfer students I know who actively wanted to do research, all but one of them has been able to find research by this summer, with most finding a lab by winter break.

As for graduation opportunities,I don't really know what exactly to say. Obviously Berkeley is the top school in the world for the major and when you get into a lab your PI will most likely be one of the best in the world in that field, but beyond that I don't know.

1crj5j1,l41gfdi,runnaway-duck,"Firstly, congratulations! This is a brilliant milestone indeed. Younger you will be extremely proud. It truly depends on what research group you get into eventually. Cutting edge research groups have a lot of undergrads competing for a spot, so you'll be facing that no matter where you go. I've had so many brilliant undergrad kids who had to be turned down because of limited spots in my group. 

Chemistry, Materials Sciences, Biomaterials - these fields require relatively more funding per group than some other fields. So, it can get frustrating at times without valid data, publications or milestones. But in these fields, you have to think long term. I did that. While all my peers ended up moving to EECS, CS or other majors, I was always intrigued by chemistry, physics and biology since high school. Although they earn significantly more than me at the moment, I do have the satisfaction of doing fundamental research in the same exact field that I've been passionate about since high school. 

Just because you chose Berkeley or Princeton, it doesn't guarantee you a spot in one of the groups you want to do undergrad or grad research. Now is the time to slowly do your due diligence on which school has more funding per department, vicinity to National Labs in your field, government funding, private funding, etc, and most of all, professors and their research group. Once you have a general idea, then go for your best fit (don't spend too much time researching groups and obsessing over it, either). Also financial aid is key. If one gives you more financial aid, then go for that one. Student loans will drown and drain you as you enter your PhD. 

Most of all, enjoy this accomplishment and slowly enter the field of academic research. Good luck.",3,1715711603.0,t3_1crj5j1

I went to Berkeley for undergrad in math. It‚Äôs an amazing school, but yeah‚Ä¶ as an undergrad you‚Äôre kinda on your own LOL. Not much support, aside from ‚Äúgo speak to the Counclir‚Äù. 

I don‚Äôt know much about Princeton to speak about it. I know a few people from the physics department who landed in MIT and Harvard for their PHDs. They seemed to love it for that particular field :-) 

For Berkley, the city itself is a little spicy (it‚Äôs crazy in terms of crime, just because the Bay Area is unhinged at the moment).  However, the same is true for NJ :P. 

My advice would be to reach out to the professors you‚Äôre interested in both schools, and see if there is a chance you can start researching with them! Ultimately, the degrees are equally shiny in my opinion. However, it‚Äôs the experience you gain, like research experience that will truly set you up for your career or a PHD! Unfortunately being a transfer student means you have less time to adapt to the academic climate before doing the ‚Äúextra‚Äù. However, this is what makes the ‚Äúshiny‚Äù school truly shiny. It is what makes people say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to you. Without the internships or experience the degree itself, isn‚Äôt enough in this climate.

1crj5j1,l434n87,Muddy_propagations,"I feel as if the right question is not being asked. Where do you live and where do you want to live after you graduate? 

Berkeley, in California to Asia, may carry more prestige than Princeton, while a student from the Pacific Region may also fit-in better at Berkeley; feel more welcomed and similar to their community... However, in Baltimore, or England, Princeton perhaps could be better recieved by the community, and a student from those areas may fit-in better (culturally at Princeton)... Yet, if the arguments of the experienced Princeton/Cal alumni from this thread are true, going to Princeton for undergrad then transferring into Berkeley for graduate school sounds like an achievable option. Nevertheless, I hear many undergrad students from Berkeley argue that they are transfering into the Ivy's for graduate school; so take that for what it is. While it is hard to give concrete evidence for this fact--I do know that on the west coast, people like, and have heard of, Stanford and Berkeley. And when I travel to the east coast, Berkeley always creates a conversation. So honestly, you are in a win-win situation as far prestige translating into networking and job acquisitions (Berkeley vs. Princeton).

Therefore, imo, it comes down to: where do you live and where do you want to live after. Btw, Berkeley's weather has been super nice lately, but when it gets hot, many classrooms do not have air conditioning... so that sucks, and Fall semeter is hot!

Egypt and Israel had just begun talks of establishing relations, the predecessor to camp David, and other Arab countries were encouraged to do so by Iran acting as a proxy. In fact, during this time the region was quite autonomous albeit with frequent foreign interventions.

Ever since the oil crisis in the US, American politics developed a ""just the right amount of development"" mindset for the middle east. Too much prosperity and the oil crisis may happen all over again, too much instability and all resources are lost, hence began an era of indirect control to ensure local administrations are always at a disadvantage when it comes to autonomy and sovereignty.

Beef steak are safe to eat generally safe to eat with the inside not fully cooked because they are less porous compared to, say, chicken so that bacteria will most likely be only on the surface of the cut, while other meat could have bacteria contaminated between the muscles. 

Grounded meat, however, are (I'm sure that you are aware) grounded raw, mixing up the exterior cut to the formerly interior parts, and therefore generally have to be cooked more thoroughly. 

However, oftentimes meats are not contaminated to begin with, depending on the quality of the meat, cleanness of processing facility, and proper storage and transportation, so if they are not contaminated you'll be fine (check out steak tartare).

Personally when I am cooking burger myself I either use thin patty or smash burger, or sous vide + sear for thicker patty.

1h7h263,m0n3lyv,mehatch,"First, immediately after the quake, based on imperfect best guessing by experts, a possible flood danger area was set. It appears to be any land within (x) distance below (z) elevation. 

A quickly generated GIS map of any coast within around 400km by any water path, lets say below 100 feet elevation (also a guess) would result in a map like this, which would not account for the natural harbor protections of the entire interior bay shoreline.

Another factor is that the fastest path for the tsunami is in deep water at around airplane speed in the ~ 600kmph range. So any particular wave wanting to do damage to Berkeley or Oakland (I was in Fruitvale at the time) would have to speed down the coast 30km west of the golden gate, make a left turn at a right angle toward the golden gate, slow down but get higher for the last 30 miles toward the SF are coastline, pass through a one-mile-wide bottleneck under the big red bridgey dude, and then have enough power to dissipate outward across dozens of miles of interior shoreline with enough remaining force to bowl-slosh us in any significant way. 

I wasn‚Äôt too concerned, but I was also definitely still watching live news at work and curious how the impact would look when it hit SF and the golden gate at ~12:10. As of 11:50 no real crazy damage was reported from Humboldt or any wild live cam highlights from the humbolt area coast which would be early indicators, so that also assuaged my concern by me leading up to the actual end of the warning around ~12:15pm.

Edit: given the 7.0+ initial estimate for Richter scale, this is a very big earthquake (the last one this big in CA was Loma Prieta) so abundance of caution and imperfect quick math GIS mapping of the possible flood danger area was definitely justified.",2,1733450630.0,t3_1h7h263

Equating the mass massacre the Hamas committed and filmed with the very few people who died from ""friendly fire"" is disgusting, and delusional. You've obviously never experienced war. 

Since Israel does not target civilians I don't condemn them for killing people in battle. If innocent people died in the crossfire that is sad but very difficult to avoid in battle. If individual soldiers are criminals and targeted civilians I condemn that. There was a case years ago of a terrorist who tried to assassinate IDF soldiers. They caught him and he was tied up in custody, and one soldier on his own accord shot him after he was already in custody. That is illegal. That was a huge news story. Everyone condemned it. The soldier was apprehended, put on trial and punished. That's how a legal army operates. 

Palestinian children are not held hostage. Israel has prisoners who committed crimes or were caught planning crimes. 

Israel supplies a very small percentage of water (9%) to Gaza and 50% of the electricity. It is under no obligation to provide anything to enemy territory who just butchered 1200 civilians, so no, it's not a war crime.  

Israel does not limit food and medicine supply to Gaza in fact there is access food and medicine coming in that the UN is unable to effectively distribute. Hamas is also stealing the aid and selling it even though it's supposed to be free for the civilians. Haven't heard any chants against what Hamas does. Since you are so mad, maybe you want to take that on? 

Israel is not targeting civilians and the number of dead does not define genocide. Hamas is fighting from within civilian population, without uniform - add that to all their other war crimes. This choice is completely optional you know. You got issues with the casualties in Gaza? Direct them to Hamas. Why are you not speaking up against them?

The country of origin of Jews is Israel. So. 

Lol Israel does not have mercenaries. It is the military of the people. I served in the IDF, my entire family served as well as all of my friends from Israel. Never saw a mercenary.

Another unreliable source? Francesca Albanese who is not an authority of genocide. It is not her job to make those determinations. She is the one who released a fake report of an alleged IDF r\*pe the same day the Israeli detailed report on Hamas‚Äôs sexual warcrimes on October 7th was due to be released. It was a clear attempt to muddy the waters and create some kind of false equivalence. To this day she did not provide any evidence for this allegation even when the IDF formally asked her to so they can investigate. In her spare time she is a known antisemite.¬†

In general I don‚Äôt trust the UN anymore. It the organization that runs UNRWA supposedly an organization meant to take care of Palestinian refugees, many of their members are Hamas and many actively participated in October 7th. They are also incompetent at distributing aid because apparently they don‚Äôt care so much about the Palestinians as much as they care about spreading blood libels about Israel. They don‚Äôt care about doin their job and helping the Israeli refugees for the past 8 months. Deeply corrupted organization.¬†

Incidentally all other refugees in the world have their own organization - the UNHCR which takes care of al their needs an works to resettle them.¬†

Only the Palestinians get to get their own well funded organization - UNRWA - whose sole role is not to settle refugees and solve their problems, but to make sure they stay refugees forever.¬†

You cannot compare women's rights in Islamic countries to non Islamic countries. One has rights the other does not. 

I've given Islam the benefit of the doubt for years but no longer. The moderate Muslims are far too silent about the violent activities of their more extreme Muslim brothers. The Palestinians support of Hamas is a great example.

When 72% of ""Palestinians"" support the Oct 7th attacks on civilians then it's fairly clear most Palestinians can be considered Hamas supporters. Even if they may not be holding the knife doing the killing their support still makes them scumbag terrorists.
