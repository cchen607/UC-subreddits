Also, if you actually go to the school, you'll know UCI was designed in such a way as to make it very difficult for protesters to ever cut off any part of the school entirely from the rest of it.

UCI was built during the 60s, when those pesky protesters were also very prevalent. Not sure what they were griping about back then, but it was probably something annoying anyways. Hopefully some engineering students were able to get to lecture on time during that mess.",5,1714681357.0,t1_l21079o

I‚Äôm not on either side of the protest. It‚Äôs against UC rules to set up encampments on campus‚Ä¶ the protestors are in violation of this‚Ä¶ UCPD doesn‚Äôt need anything more than that in order to shut this down. They just haven‚Äôt received the order to do so

Maybe it‚Äôs because the UC council wants the students to feel like they (the students) have a say in whatever politics is going on here. 

In reality, once this gets too rowdy (on the protestor‚Äôs side), it‚Äôs going to be shut down under the premise of rowdiness or whatever. The UC‚Äôs COULD shut this down now, but they‚Äôd be labeled as opposing whatever side the protest is rooting for. And given how politically big this issue is, it‚Äôd be bad PR for the university‚Ä¶ so they‚Äôll just wait for the protestors to inevitably bite off more than they can chew so that they can justify the removal of this encampment

I hope more supporters of pro-Palestine movements understand that people might care about the issue and disagree with the protests at the same time. People should also be free to choose whether they want to care about politics/focus on whatever else that could be going on in their lives, and not get shamed for it. There is nothing wrong with not supporting the protests as one cannot force others to hold the same beliefs.

‚ÄúFree Palestine‚Äù is a good slogan for sure, but this is a deeply issued conflict outside of this country that, boldly assuming the US could force them to ceasefire, could not be resolved with a simple ceasefire. How do we free Palestine? What are the civilians of both sides going to do after a ceasefire with Hamas still in power? If the goal is to support innocents, I don‚Äôt think simply supporting Palestine is the way to go‚Ä¶ The *resolution* of this conflict is outside of our scope, for students, the university, or even the US government.

By voicing support for one of the two sides and an immediate ceasefire, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm steering the public opinion towards a good long term solution, and thus I walk away.
I would respect the people who make informed decisions and stand up peacefully for their political opinions, which should go for any opinion on this campus, except for the explicit support of Hamas/extermination of Jews (which everyone agrees is not so peaceful, yes?). However, what the conversation has been feeling like is this: the minority opinion, anything other than ‚Äúfree Palestine‚Äù, is wrong and should not be protected. If someone says that they don‚Äôt support Palestine, then they automatically support Israel, and supporting Israel means getting downvoted to the depth of hell before having the chance to actually voice their opinions and practice free speech.

I hope peaceful political activism means everyone takes a step back and evaluates what they stand for and what they specifically want to achieve, in the grand scheme of things.",2,1714460121.0,t3_1cg5a8r
1cg5a8r,l1zukfx,sschepis,"Dear Lord some of these questions leave me worried for humanity...

""How do we free Palestine? What are the civilians of both sides going to do after a ceasefire with Hamas still in power""

Hamas is in power because of Israel's treatment of Palestinians. Lemme ask you, how long do you think Palestinians would tolerate Hamas if the Israeli brutality that propped them into power wasn't being applied? 

Israeli propaganda excuses like ""we can't have peace because Palestinians support Hamas"" are copouts designed to short-circuit any intelligent thought from occurring, instead of asking WHY Palestinians support Hamas and what could be done about that. 

Of course, talking about that leads to every uncomfortable and inconvenient truth that Israel wishes to hide.

Israel would have the world believe that they're a progressive, enlightened state. They're not. They categorically believe in their own ethnic superiority - in their status as the chosen people - and their behavior reflects it. 

I see no reason to tolerate this behavior, because I know exactly where it leads, having read enough history  to know what patterns repeat themselves. I'm really really sorry if that makes you or others uncomfortable but much of my family died in WW2 and I'm seeing terrifying parralels here and there are only two options - escalate or de-escalate and I have NEVER seen an Israeli de-escalate.

1cszyup,l4d6gmd,Paladin_127,"&gt; Makes no sense. I can draw chalk on a blacktop in elementary with whatever phrases or words I want. But doing it on a public campus is wrong? 

Not inherently. It‚Äôs been a minute, but I remember plenty of stuff written in chalk on ring road when I went to UCI. No one had a problem with it. It would last a couple days, then get washed away by the rain or grounds crew.  But we‚Äôre not talking about some sidewalk chalk- we‚Äôre discussing an encampment. 

&gt; The campus is public to anyone. 

Well‚Ä¶yes and no. It‚Äôs generally publicly accessible, but it‚Äôs not open to everyone all the time. That‚Äôs why all the buildings have doors that lock. You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find *any* state institution that is accessible to the public 24/7. 

&gt; The students have paid their tuition and they in turn can do whatever they want as long as it is not promoting anything hateful or is a hazard to the public.

Wrong. Just because the students are paying for a service (education), that does not inherently mean they can ‚Äúdo whatever they want‚Äù. They don‚Äôt own the property or facilities on campus- the state does. And as with any state owned and operated institution, there are rules, regulations, policies, and laws that govern its use. 

&gt; The camp was not posing direct harm or threat to anyone nor was it blocking to the point it was a nuisance. I frequently walked past the camp and never had any issue walking through. You gotta be 8 years old to think you can't walk through the path you like and you want to cry about it.

A distinction without a difference. Camping on university grounds is against the rules for anyone- regardless of their political ideology or purpose. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs 15 people or 150 people. It‚Äôs against the rules and breaking the rules has consequences.

U.S. Military aid is focused on delivering precision weaponry to Israel so that they do not resort to more brutal tactics in destroying Hamas‚Äîand we really need to be clear on that‚ÄîIsrael will not stop until Hamas is destroyed.

But if we are going with the crude logic that the United States is guilty of any crimes committed by a country that we provide aid to, then let's look at some other examples:

- **Russia** received about **$1 billion** in economic aid in the early 2000s, even as it engaged in the Chechen War, a conflict noted for its brutal tactics and significant civilian casualties.
- **Colombia** has received about **$10 billion** in U.S. military aid via Plan Colombia, aimed at countering drug cartels and guerrilla warfare, yet associated with extrajudicial killings for personal gain, displaced civilian populations, targeting black Colombians, and human rights abuses by security forces.
- **Sudan** received approximately **$700 million** during the Darfur genocide (2003-2006) and subsequent conflicts, despite controversies over government actions.
- **Ethiopia** has been provided with over **$4 billion** in U.S. aid from 2000 to 2021, which has faced international scrutiny over human rights abuses during numerous armed conflicts, especially in the Tigray region.
- **Pakistan** has received substantial military aid totaling approximately **$20 billion** for operations in tribal regions, where drone strikes and military tactics have been criticized for civilian casualties and potential human rights abuses.
- **Syria**: The U.S. has been involved indirectly and directly by providing aid to various groups since the civil war began in 2011, amidst widespread devastation and human rights violations. This includes over **$12 billion** in aid.
- **Somalia**: U.S. aid has supported the government and African Union missions in the ongoing fight against Al-Shabaab, with both sides accused of violations including indiscriminate violence against civilians. The total aid has been in the range of **hundreds of millions** of dollars.
- **Yemen**: Through arms and logistical support to Saudi Arabia since 2015, the United States has contributed to the fight against Houthi rebels to the tune of approximately **$3.4 billion**, despite the coalition's role in civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis.

Moreover, from 1994 to 2018, the U.S. has disbursed more than $6 billion in bilateral economic and non-lethal security assistance to the Palestinians, not including significant contributions to UNRWA.

1ci7e0a,l2a0ira,Gamplato,"&gt; Genocide rulings don‚Äôt happen overnight

I didn't even imply they did. The people you should be saying that to are the ones ruling it definitively a genocide. Until then, we can use our own analysis of the information we have. Which I did in the comment you replied to.

To your request for a source, [this article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68387864.amp) talks about a Hamas official, in Feb (when most of the deaths had already happened), saying 6K of its militants had been killed (IDF said 10K -- who knows who's more accurate). At the time, the deaths were ~30K making the ratio 4:1 civilians:militants. Considering typical [standards for urban warfare (9:1)](https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14904.doc.htm), this is exceptionally on the positive side of that.

*Note: There are other Hamas officials denying their own guy's claim but given the absolute motivation to lie (and the history of it), I'm going to lean on the less favorable numbers reported by their very own people, especially when it's still far less than the IDF number (who have reason to lie too, I get it...but we have to start somewhere).*

There are also more bombs that have been dropped than there have been total deaths. More than 1 bomb per death. So the argument for ""indiscriminate bombing"" is weak...let alone the argument for ""intentional targeting of civilians"".",1,1714672739.0,t1_l29bf0g

There are people who claim that the impetus for the Civil War was states' rights. But simultaneously, those states wanted the federal government to force Northern states to capture and bring back escaped slaves to the South.

1cvh76t,l4wb3zn,BirthdayLife1718,"My guy, it‚Äôs a public university. Unfortunately, like everything, it is an extremely controversial and divisive issue, you can‚Äôt expect everyone to drink the kool aid, dropping whatever important shit they have going on and just join the club. Not everyone has formed a hardline opinion on this, some just want to go about their business, as they have A RIGHT to do. The protestors also have a right to protest, but also a responsibility, to the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù and to other students not to disrupt other people‚Äôs right to carry on with their academics. 

The more you disrupt, the more you push people away from you and people stop sympathizing with you. These college protests are losing legitimacy due to the actions of the protesters, but at the same time gaining legitimacy due to the actions of police. But overall, according to https://www.axios.com/2024/05/07/poll-students-israel-hamas-protests , most college kids don‚Äôt even consider it an important issue (if you take the polls findings as legitimate). 

It‚Äôs one thing to try and drisupt those boomers from the 60s and 70s, but quite another to disrupt your fellow students who very well could‚Äôve supported you had you not blocked them from entering a building. You can‚Äôt expect everyone to just comply with the wishes of a minority of college kids who think that this is the best route to take, because clearly (as someone who goes to college in CA) most people do not agree or are not willing to comply. WHICH IS THEIR RIGHT TO DO. 

The thinking is flawed, the agitating is agitating the wrong people, and the vapid college kids, who arguably are just as entitled, aren‚Äôt reasonable enough to consider this, just stomping their foot on the ground and screaming ‚Äúno fair.‚Äù It isn‚Äôt the 70s anymore bud, these kids are truly in over their heads üíÄüíÄ",3,1716223782.0,t1_l4uschz

When we can live for ourselves enough to think for two seconds, then we can help those around us. College students aren‚Äôt the problem. They‚Äôre not the enemy. And if you want them on your side, harassment and fear isn‚Äôt the answer. 

All of this is aimed at the wrong institutions and the wrong people. Go to the people who started the war or who are contributing to it. Like say, our government perhaps?

This is absolute BS. I know for a fact that many CCs and CSUs give their employees a free parking pass. One would think that since non-permanent employees (adjuncts, post-docs, grad students, etc.) have low wages, few benefits, and no job security the least that they could do is give them a free parking pass. Years ago, I went to CSULB for my teaching credential and even my part-time adjunct instructors got a free parking pass.

1d1oaxj,l5wdscx,ladiemagie,"Believe it or not, but the UC is more predatory in specific ways, namely with money. I responded to u/smoothie4564 with a small description of our contract and parking situation. 

Soka wow-ed me at first because the UC system burned me so badly. One way they wow-ed me was through their free parking. Another was through textbooks in the department I taught for. At the UC, students were being forced to buy textbooks at $70 a pop, which contained information that was literally copied and pasted from school websites. in my SUA department, the school itself would buy the textbooks, along with class sets. At first this communicated to me a deep respect for the learning process.

I don't mention it, but this textbook issue was one thing that endeared me to the school and led at first to conflicting feelings in my first post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/prku8m/a\_lot\_of\_old\_memories\_coming\_up/.

I actually defend Soka at first. Funnily enough, this textbook issue began to reflect the deep dysfunction of SUA. I learned from my department that it was a normal thing for the instructor to choose a class set of textbooks, decide that they didn't like the textbook, and have the class **discard the entire set of textbooks in the middle of the semester**, while ordering and starting a **new set of textbooks in the middle of the semester**. 

As bad as the UC is, Soka is worse.",6,1716826272.0,t1_l5w4dk2

The union rep agreed when I told her. My fellow instructors told me, essentially, to stop complaining because, ""This is a fight you're never going to win."" The UC was CONSTANTLY  embattled with its various unions when I was there. One would strike, settle, then another would strike. The UC's approach seemed to be to give its workers a constant uphill battle, and then when an agreement would finally be reached, the UC would simply not follow the agreement. For example, the UC would agree to a pay increase, and then paychecks would come out without the pay increase.

I was worried when Michael Drake was appointed as President, because the liberal newspapers were GUSHING about how black he way; the publications just COULD NOT BELIEVE that the UC was getting a black president. I felt better when I saw he had previous experience (his predecessors Mark Yudof and Janet Napolitano did not--which is pretty typical across the UC per my experience lmao). And then guess what, news came out that he did the exact same shit: the UC reached an agreement with union protests years ago, simply didn't abide by the agreement, and Michael Drake went into hiding like a fucking bitch.

&gt;Can I ask what is a typical wage like for an adjunct instructor or grad student at UCI?

Grad student I don't know, but there were rumors that the school wanted to replace our lecturer positions with grad students, so I'm pretty sure it's like rock bottom.

I  last worked within UC in 2019. Our contract was prorated from a full-time salary of something like $53,000 a year (this was a pre six-year lecturer. After 6 years, one earns the title of ""returning lecturer"", which is supposed to have more job security, and the school ISN'T SUPPOSED to replace you with someone cheaper). The school worked hard to hire as many part-time contingent lecturers as possible. We were cheaper--my contract was something like $13,000 per quarter, with a weird pay schedule (we received our money in increments every 5 weeks)--and the school made more money off of us through the parking passes. If the school hired 1 full-time instructor, they would make like $300 from a parking pass, but 3 part-time contractors would yield $900-ish through parking, and of course we were paid a lower salary, few if any benefits, and there was much less risk that one of us would transition in ""returning lecturers.""",2,1716825792.0,t1_l5w200t
1d1oaxj,l5wfuf2,smoothie4564,"&gt;Michael Drake went into hiding like a fucking bitch.

Back in 2009 I actually met him very briefly when he was the chancellor. I concur that he is a coward and avoids the people he has influence over whenever possible. Shame on UCI for naming a street on campus after him.

Back to the awful pay and treatment of employees by UCI, this is why I never went to grad school. Half way through my bachelor's degree I saw the writing on the wall and said ""I need to get out of here"". I completed my bachelor's degree and said bye bye to hired education. I now work at a high school and make $70k/year with full health, dental, a pension, and summers off. Not going to grad school (other than a 1 year teaching credential program at CSULB) was a much smarter move than getting a Master's or PhD.",3,1716827034.0,t1_l5wchq1
1d1oaxj,l5wx189,ladiemagie,"Thanks for the confirmation about Michael Drake.

One thing that has perplexed me all of these years is that...the absolute worst part of teaching at the UC was *the other people I worked with*, i.e. my colleagues, coworkers, the other lecturers.

All of these issues with pay, abuse of our labor, lack of job security? When I would try and talk to  them about it, they would always argue ASSERTIVELY that it wasn't real, it never existed, that I myself was the problem. I now understand this type of reaction to be consistent with the term ""gaslighting"", but I didn't know it at the time, and it traumatized me. At the kicker was that these people had no incentive to bend over backwards defending the institutions and programs; they were at my same level. 

After I left the UC in 2019, I got an entry level job doing manual labor at a hotel. There would be similar labor abuses there, but one main difference was that **our coworkers allowed us to talk about them**. They were real, they existed, our concerns were valid. One of the guys in valet was telling us about an OSHA violation the hotel committed, and it all felt so refreshing to me to hear someone not defending something like this. 

I like the r/academia sub, because the users there tend to know what's up, and you can occasionally see some of the difficult personalities popping up. In this thread, there were some users arguing over a banal part of OP's thesis: [https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/1ck7v1m/university\_reliance\_on\_adjunct\_labor\_negatively/](https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/1ck7v1m/university_reliance_on_adjunct_labor_negatively/) 

It gets at the behavior I would see from my fellow lecturers: bending over backwards far up into their own assholes to protect the schools from criticism. These people would make contradictory arguments, all working backwards from, ""This is all just and fair."" I would see extremely serious issues with the curriculum (we're talking about stuff that would affect the entire school), but my coworkers would FIGHT BACK HARD, even during private conversations off-campus. 

The only thing that makes sense to me as to why this occurred was that these higher ed environments attracted immature, naive people. Grown men and women in their 30s, 40s, and 50s who never really grew up, living in a structured bubble.",5,1716833351.0,t1_l5wfuf2

Granted, there's really not much the school can do to improve since they are running on deficit with staff protesting for wage hike every year, but from the student's perspective it's no paradise. I think the main issue is UCOP and that California's mandate on increasing in-state admission as a trade-off for continued funding, which will help the admission chances for local students sure, but the income per head for the school will significantly decrease and end up admitting more students which increases the size of students per course.

I took a break from going back to Irvine and readmitted years later. It's a shame but I regret it. I kind of soured how good my experiences were at UCI the first time. But oh well, I'm here for an education.

UCI's priorities are weird...caring about pristine trees and building weird stuff by the Langson library but avoid cleaning any trash anywhere on campus and the ACC apartments.

And the way they approached the encampment, which I haven't learned much about, seemed cruel based off some of the things I heard that the Chancellor didn't say.

And when some Jews say that this is or feels like antisemitism, you are discounting what they think in favor of your own view? 

The root of Zionism lies in believing that Israel has a right to exist‚Äînot imply support of the Israeli government and its leaders. The ADL definition on the term says as much. Yet, it is commonly used to imply support of government. The term, which has a particular and special meaning to a specific group of people, is now being given a different definition. This leads to misunderstanding and disagreement. 

Regardless, claiming ‚Äúhating Zionists is okay‚Äù is not a good step. You may not believe that Zionists includes all Jews, but there will be people who do. This stance (which is already a rather authoritarian stance of ‚Äúhate speech is okay if it‚Äôs against a group I don‚Äôt like‚Äù) opens the door for people to channel their hatred under a sanitized banner. They can claim that they aren‚Äôt being antisemitic because they‚Äôre just using the term everyone else uses; they‚Äôre just being anti Zionist when they say that Israel should be eradicated. 

Think: how many times have you had to define or justify your use of Zionism/anti-Zionism?

There is UCI, which is a campus in the UC system.  The University of California is a part of the state of California.  It was created by the [Constitution of California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&amp;division=&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=&amp;article=IX), article IX, section 9.  The UC system is a public agency, like LA Unified Schools or any of the other public school districts in the state.  UCI gets money from tuition and state allocations.  They also get money from auxiliary services that they charge for, they biggest one is medical services, but also things like parking, housing, athletic events, etc.  Those things mostly balance out.  The money they take in for medical services goes to pay for the hospital, doctors, and those employees.  The money they take in for parking goes to pay for parking garages and the people enforcing parking rules.

The UCI Foundation is a legally separate thing.  It's a charity, just like United Way or the Red Cross.  Except, the UCI Foundation only gives gifts to the Irvine Campus of the University of California.  Of course, there's lots of people overlap.  The main people running the UCI Foundation are employees of UCI.  It really is a separate thing though.

Like a month ago, the US congress passed a bill giving Israel $26 billion in war time aid.  That part of the bill is what they should have been working to stop.

Yoav Gallant(Minister of Defence)- ""We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.""

Amichai Eliyahu (Minister of Heritage) - ""The north of the strip‚Äîmore beautiful than ever. Blowing up and flattening everything, simply a delight for the eyes.""

Nissim Vaturi(Deputy Speaker of the Knesset) - ""Now we all have one common goal erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the earth. Those who are unable will be replaced.‚Äù

Finally, Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, said there were clear indications that Israel has violated three of the five acts listed under the UN Genocide Convention.

2) Here's a crazy thought, maybe... just maybe... we should start holding countries accountable to their war crimes. And these aren't regular old war crimes, these are crimes against humanity. Intentionally sending missiles to medical conveys, UN food relief workers, shutting down opposing media, and destroying all schools, cutting off water and food aid.

The second intifada was violent and horrible. (The first arguably was not). That having been said, the word ""intifada"" means uprising and has been used to describe revolutions/uprisings throughout the Arabic speaking world.

Putting violent and negative connotations on words that Palestinians use to describe their own experiences is the oldest hasbara trick in the book.

1ckvhvc,l2wop9a,Walrusv2,"I‚Äôm not suggesting that students at UCI or faculty should be held responsible as if those actions are their own, I‚Äôm just saying that the school‚Äôs actions of allowing Raytheon to come recruit there, allowing them to hold pitches to students, is inadvisable and does feed into the conflict at least indirectly.  There is a non zero amount of institutional support they provide to defense contractors like Raytheon.  I‚Äôd rather they didn‚Äôt

I think of a it little like a boycott.  McDonald‚Äôs has been providing free meals to IDF soldiers, so whenever I have the choice to choose where I eat, I have avoided supporting them.  When UCI continues to choose to allow Raytheon there for networking and the like, they‚Äôre indirectly supporting them in their direct support of the IDF.  UCI isn‚Äôt responsible, but they‚Äôre complicit to a degree.  If everyone stopped supporting them, they would fail

And yeah, thank you for voicing your point as well",1,1715040005.0,t1_l2wel3t
1ckvhvc,l2x4f4x,Agreeable_Ad_435,"I do think that while it's understandable for a company to be excited about a big projected year of sales, it's pretty gross to lose sight of the fact that what you make means a war. That said though, I think there's a step missing between selling weapons to a country that was previously in mostly good standing around the world and being complicit in war crimes being committed by that government. And I also think it's worth distinguishing between a purely defensive system like the iron dome and offensive rocket systems, even if the iron dome gives Israel less risk in taking offensive action. Even if someone commits a violent crime and is found guilty, they should still be safe from abuse in prison. Just because the Israeli government is committing atrocities, it doesn't mean its citizens deserve the same treatment.

Allowing recruiters to come to the school or fund programs really does benefit the students by giving them job opportunities and contacts. If a student doesn't want to work for Raytheon they certainly don't have to, but I don't want the university deciding which recruiters are good and which ones are bad. Just like they shouldn't be deciding which political causes are allowed to protest on campus. I don't particularly want to see pro-Russia rallies, but if we let the institutions police ideas we don't like, the same mechanisms can be turned against us later.

I know that's a little tangential, but picking sides for which companies can recruit is policing speech. As long as Raytheon doesn't get any say in the curriculum, I'm pretty confident that students are capable of telling the difference between what's taught in class and what a recruiter says. I took environmental science classes at schools sponsored by gas companies. Besides the name on the building or a little plaque thanking them for donating equipment and facilities, it's the same science being taught.",1,1715046394.0,t1_l2wop9a
1ckvhvc,l313ckg,Walrusv2,"I disagree with the idea of the Iron Dome being completely okay - while it is true that it is a defensive system, Raytheon also develops and supplies other types of arms to Israel, things that are not intended to be defensive.  With both of these truths together it just adds up to Raytheon essentially supporting the whole of Israel‚Äôs efforts against Palestine.

Additionally, I very much disagree with the assessment that Israel was in previously good standing with the rest of the world, for a couple reasons.  

One, saying Israel has been in ‚Äúmostly good standing around the world‚Äù is a gross mischaracterization, I feel.  Basically only the Western world has ever found Israel‚Äôs actions tolerable, many other nations have found their actions inexcusable and just didn‚Äôt have the power to do anything about it, which would essentially be standing up to the US.  

Two, I‚Äôm not interested in judging the actions of any nation by its standing in the international community.  Israel has been committing heinous war crimes for decades, and this isn‚Äôt news.  A company partnered so closely with Israel as Raytheon in meeting their specific military needs would be very aware of this fact. This is just the first time the issue has gained mainstream traction in North America and Western Europe to the point of being the centerpiece of media coverage and having large scale protesting over it.  

Also, even if you do believe that it was fine before, when does the line get drawn?  What is the first step, if not asking for our domestic institutions to stop supporting Raytheon when they show no signs of reconsidering or slowing their direct support of Israel‚Äôs military efforts?

I actually used to agree with your other point, that refusing to support particular groups is an infringement of freedom of speech.  But, choosing not to support or give more outreach to a particular group is actually a virtue of one‚Äôs own freedom of speech.  In this particular instance I‚Äôm not exactly sure how it works, since UCI is beholden to the federal framework laid down for all UCs and I don‚Äôt know what control they have over who receives support from their university and who doesn‚Äôt. However, I‚Äôm willing to bet that they have a substantial degree of control over who they allow to speak, hold booths on campus, etc.  Anyways, if UCI faculty and leadership were to make a decision not to offer continued support to a group due to the group‚Äôs values and actions, that does not infringe upon anyone‚Äôs right to free speech.

This led to an escalation of military clashes initiated by Syria, and to an increase of Palestinian terror attacks against Israel encouraged by Arab states, particularly Syria.
The immediate causes for the war included a series of escalating steps taken by the Arabs: the concluding of a Syrian-Egyptian military pact to which Jordan and Iraq later joined, the expulsion of the UN Emergency Force (UNEF) from the Sinai Peninsula and the concentration of Egyptian forces there, and finally the closure by Egypt of the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, constituting a casus belli for Israel.

They are upholding and clarifying existing federal anti-discrimination laws, specifically as they apply to places of education. Also, the right to free speech (aka protesting) isn‚Äôt absolute and most schools restrict protests to ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô time and place which isn‚Äôt disruptive to curriculum nor school proceedings. Overnight camps which often turn violent certainly are not protected nor allowed. 

Second, free speech has never protected the right to advocate for ‚Äòimminent lawless action‚Äô, particularly when it comes to a certain ethnic or religious group - there have been calls for imminent violence against Jews at many of these protests. 

Finally, these protestors either don‚Äôt understand or are ignoring the basic premise that if Israel stops before Hamas is eliminated, Hamas has time and time again said they will continue to attack Israel with the goal of destroying it. There is no ceasefire that will be honored permanently, just like the ceasefire on Oct 7 was broken. Hamas has promised this.

So, by asking for a ceasefire without the unconditional surrender, return of hostages, and removal from power of all Hamas leadership, you are asking Israel to just allow itself to get attacked by a government whose aim is to eradicate them. You are asking them to accept having repeats of Oct 7 over and over again with no end, with their only option to bolster defenses, but not try to eliminate the attackers. No country would accept this. 

Can you imagine if Mexico started shooting rockets at the US, and the world told the US that all it could do was build better anti missile systems and deal with it, no attempting to end the attacks themselves?

1ck3bl4,l2np905,space-sage,"I think many things are true. I think Israel has a right to exist. I think settlements are wrong and the Israeli government isn‚Äôt doing enough to stop it.

Hamas is a terrorist organization that decided, as a group of adults who can take accountability for their actions, to kill 1200 Israelis and kidnap over 200 more, including children and babies as well. I think protestors overlook that Hamas is a terrorist organization and excuse their terrorism.

I think that Israel has a right to retaliate, as any country does when their neighbor comes in and kills its citizens. This is a war. I think war is ugly. I know civilians die in war and that is unavoidable. I think it‚Äôs awful that innocent Palestinians are paying for Hamas attacking Israel. I still think Israel has the right to defend themselves. I think they wouldn‚Äôt have built the most sophisticated anti missile system in the world if they didn‚Äôt constantly have rockets launched at their country by Hamas. I think they showed constraint by not starting a war over those rockets, and only retaliating in full after Oct 7th.

I know that Hamas takes aid and funds their terrorism with it. I know Hamas operates out of civilian buildings and uses Palestinians as human shields, because they think being a martyr is a good way to die, and they know what the optics look like because they aren‚Äôt stupid. I know Hamas wants all Jews dead.

I think this is a multifaceted issue with no clear answers. I think there is plenty of violence on BOTH sides. I think calling for the disestablishment of Israel and accusing people of being Zionists like it‚Äôs a bad thing, when it means Israel has a right to exist, is antisemetic. I think lumping all Palestinians in with Hamas is wrong, when Hamas abuses Palestinians too. 

I think I don‚Äôt see enough college protestors actually calling out Hamas, and instead see them being complicit or supportive of their aims though SJP.

I understand why Palestinians and supporters are afraid and upset. I also don't think their future safety and nationhood lies in Hamas's maximalist doctrine.

Lastly, whatever one thinks of this, the vast majority of the Jewish community and nearly all American Jewish institutions are Zionist. This also says nothing of their view of the war, Bibi, settlements, etc etc. Trying to get Zionist institutions off campuses would mean targeting EVERY synagogue in OC from ultra-orthodox to Reform, Jewish Greek life, Hillel (pluralistic), Chabad (orthodox),.

Let me be clear - there are reasonable critiques of Zionism. And it is possible imo to do this without it being antisemitic. But much anti-Zionist discourse either bleeds into antisemitism or harps on historic antisemitic sterotypes.

**Irgun (Etzel)**:
   - The Irgun's charter emphasized the use of armed struggle to establish a Jewish state. Its tactics included attacks on British targets and Arab communities. The Irgun's activities were more militant, and its actions during the conflict led to violence against Palestinians.

**Lehi (Stern Gang)**:
   - Lehi's charter was explicitly militant, advocating the use of armed force to drive the British out of Palestine and establish a Jewish state. It carried out numerous violent operations, some of which targeted Palestinian Arabs.

**Political Movements and Parties**:
   - The political movements and parties, such as Mapai and the Revisionist Zionists, had differing views on the use of force.

1d44tuq,l6db6if,ForAGoodTimeCall911,"As an American Jew I find myself disgusted by Israel's actions and deeply ashamed and enraged by the implications that the mass killing and starvation underway in Gaza is being done in my name. 

To me, ""never again"" meant never again for anyone. The idea being that genocidal acts are an inherent danger created by supremacist ideologies, and everything I hear out of Israel sounds, to me, like unabashed Jewish supremacism. Hamas' actions and support among Gazans are a natural consequence of Palestinians being given no peaceful recourse to freedom. You can look at the March to Return several years ago, in which peaceful Gazans were wounded and killed in great numbers for demanding the same rights that I've been raised to believe every human being is born entitled to.

In this way, I look at Hamas' actions the same way I might look at Native American violence against settlers. Scalpings and kidnapping and all sorts of horrible violence occurred, but the idea that it happened in a vacuum is ludicrous. Israel is a vicious aggressor. Simply look at how the West Bank is being colonized and terrorized, and this is undeniable. Before October 7th, 2023 was the deadliest year on record for Palestinian children in the West Bank. If you are a Palestinian, the only way to avoid condemnation seems to be to willingly abandon your land, your life, everything. No group on earth is expected to capitulate to conquest as the Palestinians are being told to right now.

My question is, where will this horror end? What will we Jews say if it's discovered in some months' time that the true body count in Gaza is an order magnitude higher than what's currently being reported?

I guess your questions goes to fundemental questions of history, indigineity, zionism, and the peace process.

  
We obviously agree that war isn't ipso-facto bad (you seem pro a war against Israel while I'm pro a war to defend Israel) so i would guess our disagreement is on these underlying values and history.

I view Jews as indigenous to Israel which therefore bestows some rights to the land (as stated elsewhere I view palestinains as too). If one disagrees with this premise then we have a historical debate - not one of ethics.

I view the Palestinian leadership mostly responsible for the lack of peace. Even from the 1930's with Al Hussaini, Palestinian leadership has been pushing for maximalism that has only resulted in them continuing to lose wars and with that more land. Look at the Peel comission, the UN partition, Oslo, Camp David, the 2008 deal, etc. In my opinion this is the main reason for the current situation.

Or if you can, you at least have to acknowledge that what you're arguing for is an unjust peace. 

And I know in some sense you can point to all the many examples of conquest throughout history and say ""well should X group have to give Y land back to Z displaced people?"" The point Zionists make here being that this standard is being selectively applied to them...and I would be a lot more sympathetic to that argument if we were looking at 70 years of Israel insisting on its right to a static border. But you can't really say it's all in the past when Israel is actively settling the West Bank right now, can you? To say nothing of what Israel's plans are for Gaza when the dust settles there. 

Where I can't follow Zionists is: If Israel won't allow either a truly independent Palestine, nor a single, equal state, where Arabs and Jews live under the same laws, then what they're arguing for is apartheid. The question that keeps getting asked is ""does Israel have a right to exist?"" But I think the REAL question is, ""Do Jews have the right to an ethnosate?"" And my answer would be no, no one has that right.

And the response to THIS is often ""well Israel is actually the only Democracy in the Middle East! There are lots of Arabs living in Israel!"" Except a lot of deliberate work has gone into keeping the Arabs a demographic minority. What happens if it looks like Arabs are on track to outpace Jews in the population?

I would argue that 
1) the Palestinian leadership is feeding the fire of the Palestinians by trying to remain sovereign and continuously rejecting any form of peace process
2) the starvation and killing (I can't even say mass because that's just wholly untrue) was very much controlled by the Gazans leadership (i.e Hamas, i.e. Freedom fighters). Starvation is a tool commonly used in cartels and thug groups in Latin america to subjugate their own.
3) Is there justification for the slaughter? No. But are you really putting the blame in the right groups? Folks call for a Ceasefire but demand very little from the terrorist organization. And instead of demanding multiple countries get together to fight against these terrorist organizations (which will ultimately help the Palestinaian people, something I see often when the cartels get taken down), there is demand for the Israeli side to put down their weapons and basically allow themselves to get attacked on the daily instead of just getting rid of the root.

Basically. There is no real answer to your question, but knowing the violent happenings in the countries of my multi-national ethnicities, I refuse to acknowledge that Israel has all the blame and I actually blame people calling for a Ceasefire but not putting any pressure on their politicians to get rid of Hamas, because THAT is where Hamas gets its power.

2) Israel proper is not an apartheid state. Roughly 1/5 of the country are made of up Palestinians/ Israeli Arabs that have equal rights (yes there is racism as there is towards minorities everywhere).

The west bank is more complicated and I do believe morally problematic. In this situation there is a tension between safety (for Israel) and freedom (for Palestinians). Again groups like Hamas only tighten this tension. An interesting book on the topic is called Catch 67 by Micah Goodman. 

 I'm also struck by the framing of the question - and would genuinely ask: 

The reason for military occupation in the west-bank is for security reasons. When security lets up - terrorism increases. If one would justify the violent means of Hamas for the end of Palestinian safety - would the same thought process not justify the means of military occupation for end of Israeli safety.

The reality - ala Herzl - is that other countries (religious or secular - Nationalist or Socialist) have failed to protect Jews. When shit hits the fan it always comes back to harm us. Therefore I don‚Äôt trust the sole future of Jewish peoplehood to external governments or ideologies that can change in a second. In many ways - I believe that saying Jews should simply stay in diaspora and enhance protection for all people (not saying that this is your view) - to be equivalent to saying ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter‚Äù.¬† Here is an op-ed I wrote with that argument: [https://forward.com/community/449503/zionism-is-the-jewish-black-lives-matter/](https://forward.com/community/449503/zionism-is-the-jewish-black-lives-matter/)

And ideologues on the Right in Israel are often a disgrace to this foundational principle.

I believe that making this a binary is a false dichotomy and that for the sake of Justice, Israelis, Palestinians, Jews, Arabs, etc - we need to erase the binary that existent on BOTH sides.

Self preservation is a foundational Jewish value. Protecting and welcoming the stranger is a foundational Jewish value. When they are in tension we must do the difficult work of teasing it out - rather than deferring to one of the extremes.

I do think a Jewish state is necessary and I do place the majority of the blame for the current situation on wider military groups in the area. I also feel that this isn't engaged with much within the anti-zionist community. Jordan, Egypt, Hamas, Syria, the list goes on - have done terrible things to and for the Palestinian people. Egypt also has a blockade on Israel - one much tougher (at least pre 10/7 than Israel's).

I'm not sure if that answers all of your Q's - if you don't think so please let me know. 1-2 questions are easier to focus on in terms of an answer than several (unless I write for an hour!). I'm also happy to discuss any/all these questions in person (either privately or in a wider group)",13,1717109373.0,t1_l6di2bk

1d44tuq,l6eox71,dlevine21,"thanks for the crystallization!

Zionism contains a wide range of ideologies. Some are absolutely contained with dehumanization of Palestinians. I have seen it and spend much time within the Jewish community fighting against it. Anyone in Israel (or beyond) that is cheering on what is happening in Gaza in terms of collateral damage and the death toll is evil.

The difficult questions come in regarding this tension of:

1) Safety for the future of Israel - meaning Hamas not being able to do 10/7 again nor shoot rockets

2) Freedom of the hostages

3) Immediate fafety for people in Gaza

4) Future Palestinian self-determination somewhere between the river and sea

Hamas is doing everything it can to pit these 3 things against each other. Bibi and his ilk have also certainly not helped in the years before 10/7 either. So right now there is a values tension - but I don't think its an essentialized value's tension. In other words, I do not believe that these are mutually exclusive ideas.",7,1717116394.0,t1_l6ek5l3

If the IDF is literally defending itself, then I support, but time and time again, the IDF proves that they‚Äôre genocidal maniacs and collectively punish innocent Palestinians. The hostages are not going to be freed via collectively punishing Gaza. The only way they will be freed is through a ceasefire deal, which Israel has rejected over and over again.

So you're saying all of those dead Palestinians were innocent and none of them were Hamas militants? 

I'm not justifying IDF actions here at all, but your wording of this comment makes you sound extremely biased... As someone who's trying to remain as neutral as possible, these kind of comments are the least appealing to me.

1. The missile IDF used in Rafah was an American missile of the smallest magnitude damage. CNN and the US government confirmed it as well. The explosions happened afterwards were due to different ammo caches nearby (which shouldn't have been there, together with the two Hamas leaders that shouldn't have stayed with those refugees)
2. Hamas said themselves that they will not release refugees unless IDF LEAVES Gaza, not just ceasefire. So that statement is factually wrong...
3. Hamas hiding within civilians grants a country a legal right (based on international laws btw) to attack where they hide. That's btw, the fact that stops the world leaders from enraging at Israel and stopping this war by sanctions. If Hamas weren't hiding there, Israel would have been forced to stop from day one btw. So saying Israel killing civilians is, while true, also equivalent to saying Hamas is killing civilians.

# Judah Halevi

Judah Halevi might appreciate the creative aspects of the Minions but would be concerned about their lack of spiritual and cultural value. He would likely see them as part of a trend towards secularization that does not contribute to Jewish identity.

# The Zohar

The Zohar would interpret the Minions symbolically, viewing them as representing lower aspects of existence needing balance with spiritual pursuits. It would encourage engagement with media that elevates spiritual awareness and connection to the divine.",2,1717380384.0,t1_l6uon8g

On the other side, I have heard how the Palestinians would not accept the Jews coming to the homeland, mainly due to their religion ideology. I'm turn, the Jews had to start defending themselves.

The March for return was during 2018-2019, held each Friday where Palestinians protested against the siege and restrictions by Israel in the Gaza Strip. Different human rights organizations like human rights watch and amnesty have cited that medics and press were being targeted by Israel. 

I know the common consensus amongst ppl that hold your similar views is that Israel left Gaza in 2005, and the siege was to thwart terrorists. However the great March for return is utilized as an important event in Palestinians peacefully protesting against what they saw as injustice by the Israeli government. 

I‚Äôd also like to point out that there are legitimate calls for concern in terms of Israel‚Äôs blockade on Gaza even if was to prevent Hamas, it was used as collective punishment in Gaza. This is what they were protesting.

I want to thank you for making this forum and giving the responses you have. I don‚Äôt go to UCI, I go to UCSB, but I am very invested in this conflict and found you gave thoughtful responses while scrolling here.

Being non-biased about such sensitive issues is so important- I think it is essential not to downplay the incredibly strong emotions of anyone who has been traumatized and suffered by this awful history of Israel-Palestine and the current conflict. 

My grandfather is Jewish, and so is my childhood best friend, and so are a great many people I know and like and respect. Even if I didn‚Äôt have people close to me who believe Israel‚Äôs existence is necessary, I would still want to respect human beings who desire self-determination and the safety of their people and culture.

I very much agree that Hamas is an obstacle to peace and follows a maximalist ideology, and that as long as maximalist ideologies dominate, there will be an endless cycle of violence (this is what has already been happening). 

That being said, there is not a moral justification in my mind for the Palestinians to have their own humanity constantly denied and made to seem less important than the Israelis. 

Certainly, there can be an argument that Israel and its people have faced so much aggression that it needs a strong military and control of the region.

The way that this has manifested is morally abhorrent. Palestinian human rights are constantly denied. There is immense pushback against a Palestinian State, since there is a huge question of legitimate governance- but without a state, these people are perpetually victimized, with little hope of their lives improving. 

I guess I have two main questions.

What prevents Israel from being defined as an apartheid state, besides the fact that it ‚Äútechnically‚Äù hasn‚Äôt annexed the West Bank? Palestinians are systemically discriminated against. Their buildings are easily demolished to make way for Israeli ones. When I look at all the evidence, it seems that even if Israel is not yet an apartheid state, those in power would be fine turning it into one as long as they can annex further territories (I believe this is called Kahandism). 

What is the world‚Äôs moral obligation while we witness the carnage in Gaza, a war that seems entirely unjustified and only makes some sense with the hostage situation? It is undoubtedly brutal what Hamas has done. They are partially to blame for this. At the same time, what is the war effort doing to help the hostages? Some of their families feel abandoned. One can surmise that political motivations have led Netanyahu and co to continue this war rather than try to negotiate a ceasefire in good faith. They are more bent on revenge and annihilating Hamas than returning captives. Not only did the IDF and government fail the people on October 7, they continue to fail to protect the lives of their own. To tie this to the question- again, what do we do as global witnesses of this war, that is so blatantly one-sided and political? The UN have largely condemned Israel‚Äôs actions. Leaders around the world have spoken out. Protests are not limited to universities. The issue is brought before the ICC and ICJ, yet Israel‚Äôs leaders don‚Äôt succumb to anything. Will international interference ever happen, for example as in the creation of the Palestinian State? I don‚Äôt see Israel as it‚Äôs currently governed ever accepting that state, but to be frank that is not for them to decide whether or not a group deserves self-determination. That is literally the reason why Zionism exists. (I am not advocating for a militarized Palestinian State, but maybe if they can‚Äôt have a military, Israel shouldn‚Äôt, either). 

I would really appreciate your thoughts. Thank you for your balanced perspective. I try to keep my thoughts open, as well.",1,1717140684.0,t3_1d44tuq
1d44tuq,l6h3fr1,dlevine21,"1. the situation in the west bank is bad. The main problem is that Israel is caught in a catch 22. If they reduce security and military control - they run the risk of the West Bank becoming another Gaza (in other words being taken over by a terrorist group. If they continue the military occupation - they deny rights to Palestinians. There's a great analysis of this in this book here: [https://www.amazon.com/Catch-67-Left-Right-Legacy-Six-Day/dp/0300236743](https://www.amazon.com/Catch-67-Left-Right-Legacy-Six-Day/dp/0300236743)

It is called Kahanism - after the Rabbi Meir Kahana - who was barred from running in Israeli elections due to his extremist. Sadly there are those today who follow his ideas - they are despicable.

2) I'm curious why you're so quick to suggest the war in Gaza is unjustified (this is a genuine question - not a gotcha type thing - it just never sounds good over text lol). Hamas has 100+ hostages and has further sworn to perpetuate attacks like 10/7 again and again all while constantly shooting rockets into Israel and using international aid money to build a network of tunnels into Israel to further terrorist aims. This is all while using their population in Gaza as human shields - using hospitals and refugee camp as terror operating centers. Their original charter calls to kill all Jews - while blaming virtually all wars on the global Jewish people. If this is the stuff of justice - we're in trouble!  I would argue the general Israel/Gaza war is the quintessential just war (to say nothing of specific Israeli actions which may be terrible/criminal).  Curious to hear your thoughts!",5,1717162470.0,t1_l6g1e63
1d44tuq,l6jghe3,Swimming_Ad8490,"I know this is a sensitive issue and I never want to downplay the horror of 10/7 or of the families that continue to suffer not knowing what‚Äôs become of their loved ones. I wish the pro-Palestine protestors had consideration for this and called for a ceasefire with hostage release. 

That being said, the war effort seems to have left the hostages behind long ago in the pursuit of utterly destroying Hamas. Over the past few days, several American news outlets have reported on families of the hostages feelings left behind, as well as the Times of Israel: https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-sacrificing-hostages-families-say-after-fraught-hanegbi-meet/amp/. Haaretz has been reporting for a while, since before Rafah, that the continued warfare does nothing for the hostages‚Äô safety and mainly serves political interests (or some future idea of safety with a Hamas-less Gaza). I understand that some of these are news outlets that have left-leaning bias. When that bias is holding leaders accountable, wanting them to negotiate to the best of their ability and value human life (including their own) instead of waging war, I can‚Äôt help but agree. 

Hamas is absolutely a terrorist organization with stated genocidal goals. They are an obstacle to peace and I disagree with anyone who makes the euphemism that they are freedom fighters. Surely, Palestinians need new governance. What does that governance look like? Is it necessarily a violent response to occupation? Well, think about the conditions that created Hamas- a sense of prevailing hopelessness, disillusionment with any other solution, and anger after generations of trauma at Israeli hands (I am not saying the Israelis were always initial aggressors). How is what‚Äôs happening now ensuring a peaceful Palestinian state in any way at all? This campaign, call it a genocide or not, has leveled so much of Palestine, mosques, universities, and infrastructure, that they have ‚Äúsent them back the Stone Age‚Äù as some in Israel wanted. It will take years to rebuild. Think about all the hopelessness, anger, and disillusionment that comes with that. 

From an outside perspective, Israel so easily overpowers its enemies that there‚Äôs a sense of hopelessness too. Those Kahanists and Radical Zionists who want to have all of Greater Israel have a government who agrees with them- and what does that mean for the Palestinians that don‚Äôt want to become Israeli or would respond with violence? 

There are two outcomes if Israel annexes Gaza and the West Bank. Either Israel truly becomes an apartheid state, with brutal law enforcement on a certain group within their borders. Or they harm the Palestinian people even further, expelling them from their land entirely. This doesn‚Äôt seem that far fetched given that some Israelis actually want this to happen and the war effort has not cared about creating millions of homeless. 

So, for me the war effort does not entail a lasting peace, it has instead created a global anxiety that Israel intends to expand its borders or otherwise keep the Gazans under their control, much as the West Bank, and continue a cycle of suffering. I am sorry if I seem too biased against Israel. I value the Jewish people and culture as much as I do any other. Their lives are equally important. I just see the war as a continuation of senseless violence, as part of this cycle that for the sake of humanity must end, and I believe there would be better solutions if not for the egotistical and corrupt men in charge. The dehumanization must stop and endlessly bombing the Palestinians while openly giving up on the hostages isn‚Äôt helping that.",2,1717192931.0,t1_l6h3fr1

During the October 7th attacks Hamas killed 845 civilians 350 Israeli soldiers and took 239 hostages. and just to be clear I condemn Hamas killing civilians. Meanwhile Israel has killed 35,000 Innocent civilians, including 103 journalists, 224 humanitarian aid workers, and 179 employees of UNRWA. 52% of the deaths caused by Israel are also women and children. Not to mention the thousands trapped under rubble who go unaccounted for. Since the attacks Israel has also killed 479 Palestinians in the West Bank where there is no Hamas, Israel has also a taken over 10,000 Palestinians hostage, Israel is so trigger happy they even accidentally killed some of their own people.

2. There are only 30,000 Hamas members out of a population of 2.3million, that‚Äôs only 0.76% of the population of Gaza less than one percent, the rest are Innocent civilians who had nothing to do with the targeting of civilians that took place during the October 7th attacks, and yet Israel is exerting collective punishment against all of them and killing innocent people who had nothing to do with October 7th. Hamas was elected by a 40% plurality back in 2006 and hasn‚Äôt had an election since and has stayed in power since then. That was 22 years ago. The median age in Gaza is only 18.

1cjmkd9,l2h756m,Zot_Zot_Zot_,"This strikes me as an interesting balance of being both encouraging and disappointing.¬† On one hand, serious props to Gillman for his continued choice to (mostly) keep the police away from the protest. Police actions on other campuses have been despicable displays of violence, especially at UCLA and Columbia. I'm also grateful to Gillman for his willingness to negotiate. It sounds like his people are making efforts to engage with some, if perhaps not all, of the protest's demands. His stated optimism is a breath of fresh air, although I do wish he was open to considering all of the demands.¬†


On the other hand, there is some deeply problematic messaging in here. Gillman states that ""the continued presence of the encampment is deeply troubling...because of the unease it causes many in our community in light of the unfortunate developments that have unfolded at other universities."" This is, quite frankly, inane, and it is fundamentally undemocratic. First, we *must* get over this belief that people must always feel perfectly comfortable with their surroundings. If universities are places where diverse ideas and discussions are found, then they will always involve discomfort. And that is precisely the point of having these diverse discussions! If we are truly committed to democracy, then we are are necessarily committed to uncomfortable discussions.¬†¬†


That is perhaps what is so problematic about the blanket assumption that these protests are antisemitic. That's a fundamental misrepresentation of the protests' aims, and it allows people to reject the protests' ideas without actually considering the merits of the argument. If being made aware of genocide makes a person unsafe, that person's unwillingness to engage in uncomfortable ideas actively makes the world a more dangerous, violent, and inequitable place. Especially at this moment in time, I implore people to ask whose safety is coming at the expense of your own need to feel completely safe and comfortable.¬†


A second reason why this comment is problematic is because it holds our protest to an absurd standard. Apparently, the UCI protest is accountable for the actions of all protests on all campuses. I am aware of exactly 0 problematic incidents that have occurred as a result of the encampment's existence, but apparently the encampment's *demonstrated efforts* at maintaining a peaceful protest are less important than what *could* happen but hasn't yet. It is true that the protest could turn violent tomorrow, but that is also true of anything that has ever happened on campus. In theory, there is a non-zero chance that anyone on campus could become violent. We have collectively decided that we are okay with this non-zero chance, and we can and should choose to be okay with the non-zero chance that the encampment will escalate.¬†


Edit: A third thing that frustrates me about this is that this line in Gillman's email can be read as blaming protests for ""unfortunate developments that have unfolded at other universities,"" but this neglects the fact that encampments are frequently not at fault for the worst incidents of violence. UCLA is a great example of this. The UCLA anti-genocide encampment was not removed because it engaged in violence. The encampment was violently attacked by pro-genocide protesters, and UCLA actively allowed the violence to happen. Instead of taking action against the pro-genocide protesters, UCLA decided to engage in its own night of violence against the anti-genocide encampment.

The problem is that the encampment is a target.  At any time, we could see a group of agitators show up and surround the encampment, like what happened at UCLA.  Then what?  You can't keep 100 police officers there at all time.  The students will complain and it will cost a fortune.  If a crowd of violent counterprotestors show up, it will take a few hours for the police to organize and get there.  It's going to be a few hours of violence, just like at UCLA.

All it takes is one idiot to throw a molotov cocktail into the encampment and there's going to be students who are seriously injured or even dead.  After seeing the fireworks they launched at UCLA, I don't think such a scenario is a complete fantasy.

Anyway, from my point of view that is what must be going through Gillman's mind.  What if the worse case happens?  He wants this over, really for the safety of the students.

So they left. 3 hours later, LAPD showed up with riot gear. By all accounts, they did not make a single arrest. The next day, UCLA made a statement about how bad the violence was but failed to point out that one side was attacking, one side was defending, and for hours the police were nowhere to be found. To be clear, the attack involved chemical irritants (pepper spray), bats, and explosives (fireworks) being thrown into the encampment.¬†


The so-called ""sweep"" of the encampment by UCLAPD, LAPD, LASD, and CHP occured the next night. There was no fighting happening whatsoever. I say this to point out that at this point, none of these police departments were breaking up a fight.

There was also a SWAT team posted with snipers, causing some protesters to reference the Kent State Massacre in tweets.¬†¬†


With this clarification made, what should UCLA have done? It should have let the peaceful protest be. Violently arresting a peaceful protest and failing to take any real action against the attackers communicates two major sentiments.

My whole premise is that having more of a police presence might have deterred some of the violence from the counterprotesters. You said that police response was despicable.

Also this encampment is a major liability for the Campus. I agree with your non-zero chance argument, but the presence of the encampment increases the chance of violence significantly. Several campuses had either police or ""counterprotesters"" directly interact with the encampments and caused issues. The difference between any other day and today is the fact that there is a physical encampment on campus protesting one side of an extremely complex and religiously charged geopolitical conflict that predates some of our GRANDPARENTS with the goal of severing ties with a country AND everyone from that country.

""0 problematic incidents that have occurred as a result of the encampment's existence""- so false. Whether it was the encampment's fault or not, there has been plenty of incidents. In other universities, buildings and pathways that students use for classes have been blocked and university property desecrated. When you're supporting a movement calling for the removal of Israel with violence (what do you really think those Pro-Palestine chants mean?), eventually people who disagree will respond. The whole genocide thing is much more complex, especially when encampments use pro-Hamas rhetoric. (see chant list below, that I've heard at UCI). To some, the underlying Palestine movement is calling for violence and unfortunately can be met with violence, which wouldn't have happened on campus without long-term encampments. Hope UCI remains peaceful, but to think there isn't a significant elevated risk is insane. 

Regarding UCLA... admin asked for the encampment to be removed, and on a random Wednesday night a bunch of counter protestors in Westwood- a pretty Jewish area, brought violence to the campus. To think UCLA allowed this to happen first starts with allowing the encampment to continue. It is ridiculous to think that campus police can stop hundreds of people from rioting without preparing and calling for backup. Totally unrealistic and unfair accusation. 

Definitely not an simple situation, and admin is trying to maintain safety and educational goals, prevent escalations which have occurred in other campuses, while also address unrealistic demands of the protestors, some of which is out of their power.

People who do that for fun shouldn‚Äôt own pets. It literally looks depressed. Its common knowledge that coyotes are out an about. That cat is eventually gonna get attacked by a coyote like we saw a few days ago

For those of you think this isnt neglect it can be neglect/animal endangerment and heres why:

1. It is commonly known that coyotes are everywhere, and they've taken countless cats. If you willingly let your cat out with that knowledge Its possible this can be considered neglect. (Several violations under **California Penal Code Section 597**)
2. There is NO reason to put a harness with a bulky camera that is almost as big as its head and let it walk around. It looks like it hates its life. In the event another animal tries to attack it, that cat is screwed. If this is some kind of experiment, WHY? its sadistic and the owner needs help.

I definitely sympathize with you because college is insanely expensive, but once you actually start talking to some lawyers about this (which most likely won't be free), you're probably going to realize that this just isn't a viable option for you.

For starters, you haven't even listed an actual crime. I'm far from an expert in financial matters, so I won't try to find an actual crime here (hopefully someone can), but you need to specify what about "" pisspoor handling of students financial aid and the fact that they completely ruined my academic year"" was illegal. That means it's time to read the fine print and find what exactly was violated. If you can't find anything, you don't have a case.

1ct7dza,l4cx5rc,Gamplato,"&gt; Okay, gotcha, so you're a genocide denialist and refuse to listen.

If this were a genocide, I would be, sure. But it absolutely isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶unless your definition of genocide includes every other act of urban warfare in the 20th and 21st centuries.

It‚Äôs not a genocide for any or all of the following reasons. Just ONE of these should AT LEAST demonstrate that you can‚Äôt call it factually one. Multiple of these should demonstrate that it probably isn‚Äôt. All of them should demonstrate that it almost definitely isn‚Äôt:

- Even using Hamas-reported numbers, the civilian:militant death ratio is ~4. That‚Äôs lower than almost all measured instances of urban warfare and it‚Äôs less than half the international standard.

- There is less than one death (of any kind) per bomb dropped. This indicates targeting.

- They have warned the population before every campaign. A common refutation to this is that they bomb where they tell civilians to go. They don‚Äôt. They didn‚Äôt tell them to ‚Äúgo south‚Äù. They told them a very specific safe zone on a beach. They have NOT bombed where they said they wouldn‚Äôt. Not once. Add to that that Hamas, a military group known for embedding itself amongst its own civilians, follows them around as they provide the usual shielding they‚Äôre used to.

- They have had the ability to annihilate all Palestinians on Palestinian land for decades and the population has increased dramatically. So there is not and has never been (since Israel‚Äôs beginning) an example of genocidal tendencies.

- There hasn‚Äôt been a single piece of evidence that the IDF, by policy, targets civilians‚Ä¶which, ironically, is not the case for the enemy they‚Äôre trying to remove.

- They have an explicit motivation that is a perfectly reasonable alternative to genocide‚Ä¶getting rid of the government and military that has a history of targeting civilians and recently committed such an act that hasn‚Äôt been seen outside of Africa since 9/11.


&gt; You are, presumably, a current student or alum. You should ask for a refund if you're not able to connect how more money going to support Israel's genocide and funds spent on overtime for dozens of police and deputies means less money for other things.

Also, the bombing of everything to the point that they are killing their own shows a lack of precision.

1ct7dza,l4dfuo4,bnyc18,"Your post shows a lack of critical reasoning:

- The high estimate TOTAL deaths from the conflict (including militants and civilians, as well as those killed by Israel or hamas) is 40,000 people. Israel was reported to have dropped 45,000 bombs total. Israel‚Äôs non-reporting of civilians isn‚Äôt relevant to the claim of ‚Äúmore than 1 bomb per death.‚Äù

- friendly fire is a tragic consequence of war (as is civilian deaths). This does not make Israel genocidal. It is an unfortunate reality of every party of war in history that somehow people like you twist into more sinister intentions for Israel

- Israel is in the midst of a war in foreign land. While they certainly can estimate casualties in advance of missions, they have no way to formally calculate the death totals. The US could not estimate *actual* deaths in Japan until after the fighting stopped, when they could send a team of experts in to investigate and it took them a year to come up with numbers that have been highly refuted throughout history.

If I‚Äôm not making myself more clear, the issue is that the UCI administration conflated the larger group of peaceful student protestors, who were standing outside the lecture hall, with the few who organized and committed the action to occupy the lecture hall, which caused the cops to indiscriminately march against ALL of the protesors. Had the cops just responded to the people who occupied the building and not the student protestors standing outside the lecture hall would have been at least a more contained and appropriate action that still preserves freedom of speech for everyone on campus.

Sure, them occupying and placing debris around the Physical Sciences lecture hall is an issue by itself that disrupts teaching and obstructs entry into the lecture hall for other students, but the fact the campus administration over exaggerated that there were ‚Äúseveral hundred‚Äù student protestors occupying and barricading themselves within PSLH (when it was only a few protestors who occupied the steps and balcony integrated within the Rotunda of PSLH and the student protestors gathered outside the lecture hall) and that the protest supposedly got violent is the massive bad move on the admin‚Äôs part that instigated the massive police activity. What‚Äôs worse is that the administration later walked back on their claim AFTER the damage was said and done.

The encampment protesors didn‚Äôt even vandalize or destroy anything within PSLH or any school property, all they did was just stand on top of the balcony and stairs

edit: I forgot to mention that a small group of protestors did zip tied the lecture hall doors shut, which is an issue that does prevent entry into the lecture hall by other students and faculty members, but my point still stands that the way the administration initially framed the situation as ‚Äúviolent‚Äù in the zotalerts and ‚Äúseveral hundred‚Äù students occupying the lecture hall was an over exaggeration and DID NOT require a massive police from 12 different Police departments equipped with riot gear.

You cant seriously expect the cops to come in and start identifying the ... 3 or 2 individuals who actually barricaded the doors and whatnot hiding amongst the hundreds of protesters and cherry pick them out. Its not reasonable. 

Once you become apart of their protest you are collectively all in violation of an unlawful protest due to whatever crime occurred regardless of who specifically did or did not do anything. You cant retreat into a ""peaceful protest"" after you vandalize property and expect the protest to provide you immunity. This is why the protest was dispersed for the few that made unlawful acts within its crowd. 

Lets also not forget that these people were camping on public property for over two weeks. That was in direct violation of UCI policy and Gilman was very lenient on this [https://conduct.uci.edu/policies/pacaos/university-properties.php](https://conduct.uci.edu/policies/pacaos/university-properties.php) literally on the first page of policy.

There's a reason these idiots are doing this here, its because anywhere else they would not be tolerated. Camping for 2 weeks+? Gillman was extremely lenient, especially after UCLA/UCSD crap they pulled and I am guessing a lot of these people were spillover from that as well.

regardless, UCI has already said those receiving and those who qualify for financial aid will not be dropped from housing nor classes. everyone just needs to be patient and wait. everything at UCI has an official process and there's probably a bunch of technical difficulties they're probably experiencing that we don't know about. just because we're low income doesn't mean we can't adhere to civility and the system the university has in place. more of us should be grateful they're still working hard to release it to all students and that UCI has ensured housing and classes won't be affected. we're so privileged to even be attending here for a lower price and/or free. some of us even get a refund every quarter for going to school. all i have to say is, relax and trust the process. although it's late, they're still working to get everything out to students. don't forget OFAS are people too just working the jobs and following UCI's policies and procedures.

i do feel for the students living off-campus and wish i could help. hang in there, they're working on this.

UCI has it's own problems and their systems, processes, and actions have been unfair in so many cases. don't even get me started on not ensuring students understand what a 2-year housing guarantee means and not working harder with off-campus housing communities near campus. regardless, we don't know the full story of what's happening at OFAS, which was the main point of my comment. i apologize for any confusion and hope everything gets resolved soon.",1,1725552934.0,t1_llnbnuw

Like many universities, UCI Is  accepting way more people to attend the school than they can support. All UCI has is the off campus housing website. To me this is essentially saying yea we aren't gonna fix the main problem so we'll just give you resources to find it yourself. 

Also aren't they building another parking lot right now near Mesa?? That should've been more housing instead of trying to make it a commuter school with thousands of students struggling to find housing all the time.",3,1725560566.0,t1_lln815w
1f95i6l,llo5e12,Educational_Train612,"Sadly, I don't think they would move payment deadlines since it's always been that way :( Only make deferments or contact the departments that students will be late on payments.   
  
Unfortunately, from what I've heard from some alumni UCI used to be known as a commuter school so some years it was less common for students to live on campus. I think it wasn't until after COVID did more students have an increased interest in on-campus housing (for valid reasons). and yes, UCI is admitting a lot more ppl than what they have housing for but that's why Housing has always said living on-campus is not required and it's only a 2-year housing guarantee that UCI provides incoming students. 

  
also, from what i heard/seen, the construction around Mesa Court actually looks like more housing for the RH's!! i think it might be a little too close to the student center parking and awfully close to the other classic halls to be another parking structure. Plaza Verde 2 in ACC and the Verano Towers for graduate students seem to be efforts to create more on-campus housing and address some of the increased demands. of course, UCI can always do more with the amount of money they get from donors and student tuition",1,1725561709.0,t1_llo1sgj

People are saying ""they crossed a red line by going inside the building"". PLEASE google the history of the ""Sit-in movement"" in the black civil rights movement. If it weren't for sit-ins, many areas in America would still have race segregated schools and businesses. Sit-ins are extremely American and are a fundamental and effective form of peaceful, nonviolent protest.

We are seeing similar horrors on both sides of this conflict including to Palestinians and it‚Äôs disgusting. Regardless of national identity, this should not be happening, period. 

Here I found [an article](https://mo-husseini.medium.com/50-completely-true-things-1ce672087b28?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR0_De4CKUVkGuiH6oYDB4P-UEwme44xKcQ5HIBnD3vZN_2IGRQqRrPESbE_aem_AfvtFdcyeB48tdo31kiAPXVY0PVTIvjeVZxr4xh2eZU7Ywm1kcxZvpvoV7Ym4MnCtujlp5BCqN9DPpnQtcoXgm9k&amp;mibextid=Zxz2cZ) that pretty much summarizes my views on this. I would like to know what you think.

The reason I support Palestine if pushed to choose a side is due to the imbalance in casualties. It seems that Palestinian/Gazan citizens are at the disadvantage in this war, with [30K+ deaths](https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/16516/israeli-palestinian-casualties-by-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank/) due to bombings from the IDF. This does not in any way discount the value of lives lost on the Israeli side, and I grieve their loss as well. The reason I bring this up, is to demonstrate how imbalanced this war is, and why I support Palestine (not Hamas).

This has nothing to do with the existence of Israel as a state, I will always stand by independent identity of Israel as a state.",2,1715727799.0,t1_l42lo3g

Read The Intercept's story, linked in this very article. This Atlantic article makes no attempt to debunk what The Intercept reported, instead opting for a ""trust me bro"" approach.

So the question is how do eliminate Hamas and bring the Palestinian rapist men to Justice?

This is a *weird ass statement*. Honestly, if your attitude is as slimy as ""girls that are uglier than me are getting bfs, why aren't I?!?"" then I can see why you're not as lucky in the dating world as you might hope. Physical appearance isn‚Äôt the sole factor in dating. A good, kind personality and genuine connection often matter much more.

For what it's worth, I'm an asian dating a non asian. We met at UCI. All it takes is one person to be interested and want to date you. If you don't find luck here, that's perfectly reasonable. UCI is just a small bubble part of the larger OC/SoCal area. I'm from LA, it's one of the most diverse places in the world.

To be clear, I'm not super confident in my own body and I'm working on that, but the point I'm making is unrelated, as my issue isn't not finding people. It's that this culture makes me not want to even try to find someone. Doesn't seem worth the stress or pressure.",2,1731966312.0,t3_1gtljzk

1gtljzk,lxolzg7,AlyxTheCat,"Why would you feel its okay to lump together an entire race like that? Asians at UCI are incredibly diverse, there are Chinese, Koreans, Filipinos, Japanese, Indians, Arabs, Palestinians, and ethnic Jews, and yet we all don't date outside of our ethnic groups? Also, especially in California, people in the same ethnic group can have extremely different cultures and habits. A Chinese American family who immigrated here 200 years ago will have a wildly different culture than a Chinese international student. A Chinese international student from Guangdong province will straight up speak a different language (at home) than one from Beijing. A child of immigrants will be more similar in culture to an American than someone from their parents' home country.

I absolutely abhor this generalization of Asian Americans as some kind of homogeneous blob. Maybe you think this school lacks diversity because you refuse to see diversity.

And even if what you said was true, why single out Asians? If what you said was true and ALL Asians date within their own in-group, why is this stigma only given to Asians? If it is real, its definitely not unique to Asian culture, but a value that's shared with basically all non-Americans. For international students, its probably a product of being put in an unfamiliar environment, with completely different customs and alien traditions, and wanting a sense of security. And I bet that if this were true, and ALL Asians date only Asians, then it must be true for other groups as well.

Who knows, maybe if you learned to see people not for the immutable characteristics they have, their skin color, or their ancestry, but instead for the individuals that they are, people would try to date you more. Look where you've gotten yourself. I'm sure there are tons of Asians on campus who would be willing to date you, but just like a racist, who may sneer and jeer at the sight of anyone who is not white, and then wonder why they treat him coldly, you seem to go into every relationship with your hateful ideas, and then wonder why when people see that in you, they turn a cold shoulder.

And why don't we apply Kant's Categorical Imperative(s)? What if everyone had the same ideas as you, that Asians only date within their ethnic groups? Then nobody would even try to date Asians, they would be ostracized and be forced to date only other Asians! Its a self fulfilling prophecy, and an idea that only leads to more harm.

According to the public records request, UCI spent at least $2.9 million on the outsized and brutal police response to SJP and FJP protestors. My colleague, Tiffany Willoughby-Herard, when being arrested, famously shouted about how this all could have been books, or scholarships, or housing, or aid. And, I guess, now we can sort of quantify how many books and scholarships, or how much housing and aid. Chart linked. 

Note: typo, I think, because USB in the chart should probably be UCB. Also, look at UCB and UCLA lmao: $8 and $10.5 million, respectively, while students at every campus annually struggle with housing assignments and late financial aid allotments. Money talks. Screams, even.

Our front desk staff is super helpful and discrete, so don't be embarrassed at all. Just ask for a 'Surprise Pack' if all the options we have are overwhelming. Then all we ask for is to check your student id (just to ensure you're a UCI student), but we don't collect or share any of that info.

These folks know it‚Äôs awkward, but your health is wayyy more important than 30 seconds of blushing when you pick them up. And, yes, pick up a couple dental dams and internal condoms too. Anyone who has sex (especially if it‚Äôs outside of marriage) should be familiar with how all 3 work, on their bodies and their potential future partners‚Äô bodies.

This goes for women as well as men. Even if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have a need for them in the near future, maybe a friend or roommate will and you‚Äôll be able to help them out in a bind. 

Also, be aware that these have expiration dates and the packaging can get damaged/item compromised from exposure to sun, water, friction (like being stored in a backpack, purse, or wallet) for long periods of time.

Have fun, but be safe and smart about it.

ETA: ALSO this is a good time to test for any allergies to things like latex or commonly used condom lube.

There are over 3300 colleges in America, UCI is in the top 30-40, so youre getting a top 1% education in a country where most people dont have a degree.

I went to a small high school in Davis where everyone's parents were college educated and worked at UC Davis (one of the best vet and ag schools in the world) so standards were high, UCI were many people's dream school and i dont know a single person who got in. 

When i transferred from CC UCI invited people in the area to meet, almost half of them chose UCI despite being accepted to UCLA and/or UCB.

Theres a special ranking for universities under 50 years old, and UCI was consistently top 5 in the world, often top 1, competing with Hong Kong universities. Were still only 59 years old, and already competing with the most prestigious west coast universities which are twice as old, give us another 59 with this trend and they will be far behind. Our Masters in Business Admin is top 50 in the nation, climbing fast every year, and we have 5, Darmouth (a Ivy League) has 4.

They did this primarily because of money. Grad students who are needed to support the teaching of large classes became about 30% more expensive after the strike. There isn‚Äôt any more money to pay them this (actually there is a lot less money because of budget cuts). That meant that departments had to cut their grad numbers by about 30% or more (some departments didn‚Äôt take any students in a given year). Because of this they need to keep classes smaller because they have less support. One way to do this is to major restrict. Cognitive sciences did this, for example, and didn‚Äôt warn psych science that they were not going to cooperate on their co listed classes even though both majors take the same 3 classes split in both departments. A nasty surprise that was only discovered at the start of the year when complaints from students happened.

I went to tech school in upstate New York fresh out of high school‚Ä¶.  

And the only reason i‚Äôm mentioning all of this is because UCR was mediocre in support, in faculty, in specialized programs that lead to actual experiences and careers‚Ä¶ idk it‚Äôs up to you, but really look into the major and which one better suits your post grad needs, because UC schools are expensive and honestly Riverside was dangerous as fuck.

You worked really hard, and
Your parents are proud of you regardless! UCI is an absolutely amazing school and they cost the same.    


The reason UCR has so few faculty, is because the program doesn‚Äôt have that many people enroll, and they have a wider range of responsibilities, so although program is smaller, these advisors have a lot more ground to cover, therefore less specific advise and direction. I tell you this from experience within the education major realm. I ended up with 62 units i didnt need that were from ucr (and the advice from ucr) when i graduated this week.

1cmt0wc,l32t2a5,jaidit,"&gt;The encampment near Rowland Hall remains peaceful although we are seeing reports from students expressing concerns about discrimination and harassment as well as reports of disruptive protesting that is interfering with teaching and test-taking. There have been some reports of vandalism and this afternoon more widespread painting of messages on university property are occurring. 
&gt;
&gt;While our circumstances are presenting fewer risks of disruption and concerns about campus safety than we have seen elsewhere, the encampment is still having an impact on our learning environment, and every day these violations of university policy continue there is the possibility that the situation will become more fraught. And so, all our efforts are designed to reach a peaceful resolution that leads to the voluntary dismantling of the encampment. 
&gt;
&gt;We met with the students on Monday, aiming for a resolution to end the encampment. There was a commitment to continue discussions today, and we conveyed the importance of ongoing, regular, and productive conversations. Unfortunately, the students were not willing to meet with us today. The delays by the students in agreeing to conversations has been frustrating given the need for a timely resolution of this situation and our willingness since last week to meet every day at any time of their choosing.
&gt;
&gt;We have identified several areas where it would be easy to accommodate legitimate questions and concerns, such as being transparent about how we use the resources from the Office of the President to address Islamophobia and Antisemitism and providing information about the investments of the UCI Foundation. We have already enhanced transparency on these two topics and have proposed meetings to discuss further actions. However, there are still demands on the table that are inconsistent with fundamental principles and policies of the University of California.
&gt;
&gt;For instance, to demand an end to any scholarly or educational partnerships with Israel or Israelis not only discriminates based on nationality, but also violates basic principles of academic freedom that are the cornerstone of the rights and privileges of our faculty.
&gt;
&gt;Faculty members have the autonomy to participate in any lawful scholarly or educational partnership or collaboration that they believe facilitates their work. Individual faculty members may opt out of collaborations with individuals from certain countries or organizations; others will make different choices. But academic freedom requires that these choices be made by the faculty members themselves as highly qualified experts in their fields.
&gt;
&gt;Similarly, there are demands that seek to prevent faculty and students from expressing views and organizing programs on topics relating to Israel, Zionism, or Antisemitism that conflict with these protestors‚Äô views. These demands also infringe on the academic freedom of faculty members, as well as the free speech rights of both faculty and other students.
&gt;
&gt;These demands are not only unreasonable, but the protestors also fail to recognize that the free speech rights they challenge are the same ones that protect their rights to express their own views as part of legitimate protest and advocacy. While they feel strongly that views they oppose should not be expressed, I assure you there are also members within our community who view the protestors‚Äô opinions as objectionable, even hateful, and feel they should be censored and punished merely for expressing those views. 
&gt;
&gt;People who attend a university in a free society must be tolerant of diverse viewpoints. Rather than trying to suppress differing opinions through pressure or intimidation, they should embrace our scholarly norms and engage in discussions, debates, advocacy, and peaceful persuasion. 
&gt;
&gt;The situation in Gaza is a catastrophe and the extent of innocent human suffering is unbearable to watch. Every person who cares about the well-being of humanity should have their attention drawn to this situation and advocate for whatever course of action they believe would best help end this tragedy. But having raised the saliency of this issue, it is very important for the well-being of the campus for all those in the encampment to return to legitimate forms of protest and advocacy.
&gt;
&gt;As we work to prevent the campus situation from developing in ways that would raise more serious concerns about public safety, we must also be prepared to uphold our rules against encampments and the unauthorized building of structures by using the ordinary administrative processes of the campus. Failure to enforce these rules in this circumstance would hinder our ability to prevent others from taking over parts of the campus for their own purposes. It is also unlawful for us to enforce the regulations selectively based on the political views of those involved.
&gt;
&gt;It may be worth noting that peaceful counter demonstrations and alternative academic programming have been organized on campus in accordance with all university regulations. These actions contribute to the expression of diverse viewpoints and the maintenance of order on campus.
&gt;
&gt;I continue to urge all members of the university community to do all they can to foster an environment that can be peaceful, undisturbed, and free from harassment. Those who are unaffiliated with the campus must refrain from actions that will escalate the situation or compromise the safety of our students, staff and faculty.
&gt;
&gt;We are fortunate to have tens of thousands of amazing students who have worked tremendously hard to have the opportunity to pursue an excellent education at their dream school. Even as we focus on this particular event, I hope we can all keep in mind that we have a parallel obligation to ensure that the campus environment continues to support the ambitions and success of all of our students.
&gt;
&gt;Fiat Lux,
&gt;

What follows is purely speculation, but it is informed by something that the UCSD chancellor said about their decision to remove their encampment. (To be clear, that decision was unacceptable, and their chancellor ought to resign.)


Anyhow, their chancellor [commented](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/police-uc-san-diegos-pro-palestinian-encampment/3507445/) that UCSD attempted negotiations with the encampment but could not identify a coherent leadership group to hold those negotiations with:


&gt;Since the encampment was established, university administration has attempted to maintain regular communication with encampment liaisons identified by the group. We have been met with shifting liaisons and claims that the encampment has no organized leadership with whom to reach binding agreements.


If we assume that conditions at UCI are the same or at least similar, it's not surprising at all that the students might fail to meet with admin. It's not exactly uncommon for social movements like these ones to have internal struggles, to have difficulty in identifying leadership, and to have subsequent challenges with effective organizing.¬†



But something that is worth pointing out is that ‚Äì in a way ‚Äì a lack of leadership is the entire point of the protest. It's a ""liberation zone,"" right? Well, liberation zones are supposed to be places that reject hierarchy.



Unfortunately, that's a problem when you are organizing within a hierarchal university structure. The only way that your movement can be legible to the top of the university is to have some semblance of hierarchy.


Having typed all of this out, I'm not entirely what, if there is one, the takeaway from this info ought to be. Perhaps this is just a long way of saying that I am neither surprised nor particularly upset that they might miss a meeting with admin. It's fairly well documented that coalitions such as these are tenuous, and I certainly wouldn't expect a band of undergraduates to have significant experience with organizing or negotiating. The UC UAW is bad enough at organizing, and we have elected leaders and the backing of the entire UAW; the encampment has neither of these things and is under the constant threat of violent repression by police.



Perhaps another takeaway is to think about hierarchy within universities. Universities can ‚Äì and should! ‚Äì have less hierarchy. I'd highly recommend reading Raewyn Connell's *[The Good University](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/good-university-9781350359833/):¬†What Universities Actually Do and Why Its Time for Radical Change* if this is something that interests you or speaks to you.",13,1715147172.0,t1_l331l3q

Nothing remotely approaching ""violent repression"" has occurred at any of these events.  The result has been that of the small fraction of these people who achieved their goal of getting arrested, most will dealt with via citation or similar action.  Even the ""protesters"" who have harrassed and discriminated against students and faculty, assaulted law enforcement, and vandalized buildings, will likely end up without a criminal record.",6,1715187454.0,t1_l33dbqy

This, of course, puts aside that UCLA actively allowed it's encampment to face violent repression via attack by pro-genocide assailants.... before repeating the exact same violence on the encampment barely 24 hours later.¬†


Further, every single one of our chancellor's messages about the UCI encampment has included a mention of the supposed illegality of the encampment. That's strategic. He's hanging the threat of police violence over the encampment members' heads. It's like saying, *We don't want to have to beat you and we know we don't have to.... But we will if we want to.*¬†",2,1715189498.0,t1_l35ku2a
1cmt0wc,l36j6fw,trust_ye_jester,"You saying that UCLA actively allowed violence to the encampment is a unrealistic take. Counter protesters (your 'pro-genocide' is another person's anti-terrorist group) showed up by the hundreds late one random Wednesday night. It takes hours for UCPD and LAPD to get organized and gather the manpower to deal with a rapid and violent situation, which they eventually did. 

'Supposed illegal encampment'? You can't just camp over on school property without permission. There's nothing 'supposed' about it. A part of the protest is the illegal encampment- i.e. civil disobedience. Its weird you think groups of people can just camp out anywhere on campus for weeks at a time. You can still support it, but doesn't change the reality.  

Your and other's takes on the situation seem pretty entitled. You don't see the encampment as illegal.

UCLAPD made an active decision to leave. While I can see why they stopped their engagement, nothing required them to leave the field entirely.¬†


&gt;It takes hours for UCPD and LAPD to get organized and gather the manpower to deal with a rapid and violent situation, which they eventually did.¬†


UCLA's own police chief [denies](https://twitter.com/TeresaWatanabe/status/1786572036657340913) that it would take hours to respond to such an incident, but I'm sure that you know better than him.




&gt;your 'pro-genocide' is another person's anti-terrorist group


Yes, that is how politics work. Regardless, the pro-genocide assailants used [explicitly](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-04-30/ucla-moves-to-shut-down-pro-palestinian-encampment-as-unlawful) genocidal [language](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/07/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-ucla-encampment-protesters-recall-april-30-attack).¬†


To preempt your inevitable accusation that anti-genocide protesters have also used genocidal language, it is worth pointing out that the power dynamics of Israel's [settler colonial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hundred_Years'_War_on_Palestine) occupation of Palestine fundamentally destabilizes this claim. As Frantz [Fanon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wretched_of_the_Earth) has written significantly on the use of violence towards decolonial ends, and it is frustrating how few people commenting on this matter have bothered to pay attention.¬†


&gt;You can't just camp over on school property without permission


This is true, although I question why police were mobilized against the UCI encampment before students attempted to sleep on campus. The UC UAW also erected tents on campus, but they were not ever harassed by police for their choice to do so. Thus, it is interesting to observe how the law is applied differently based on the cause that groups are supporting.¬†


&gt;Your and other's takes on the situation seem pretty entitled. You don't see the encampment as illegal. You don't understand the entitlement of the illegal encampment requiring increased campus security and yet demanding more security 24/7 from a possible violent retaliation that could happen at any time involving large numbers of people. You want more cops just surrounding the encampment 24/7? Yes the uni has a responsibility to keep campus safe, which is why the illegal encampment is problematic in the first place. You don't understand it is within UCI's right to remove the encampment, and they're choosing not to.¬†


It is readily apparent that you have no idea what my views on any of these things are. I fully acknowledge that the encampment is illegal. However, I also acknowledge the fact that the¬†laws that have been used to declare the encampment as illegal have not been applied to other groups, particularly the UC UAW. Of course, it is no secret that an long-standing [anti-Palestinian bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine_11_controversy) exists in and around UCI.¬†


Further, it is actually my position that we ought to abolish the UCPD. Despite my commitment to abolitionist politics, I can understand and observe that the mechanism that universities allege is meant to keep us safe has been violently applied to students' detriment in both its absences and its presences. Until an alternative mechanism of community safety is imagined, created, and implemented, I expect the UC to be able to adhere to its own policies regarding the deployment of its police forces.",2,1715201625.0,t1_l36j6fw

Re UCLA issue, that statement was made before the incident, and statements following the incident from show that police stepped in 2 hours after the assaults occurred after they gathered enough manpower to safely do so. They were unprepared for the scale (hundreds of people) of the riot, so the quote you provided is out of context. It is unrealistic to believe that security can immediately respond to such an event. The fault is ultimately on the UCLA admin for letting the encampment to stay for such a long period, ultimately putting campus safety at risk. 

Re genocide, there are numerous examples from the encampment side that suggest some level of support for genocide against Jews, as you acknowledge. Totally agree with the power imbalance, but that in no way whatsoever justifies any rhetoric supporting the rape and killing of civilians- regardless if it is Israeli or Palestinian. I hope we agree there. 

My comment was based on your use of the word 'supposed illegality of the encampment'. Maybe I looked too far into it since there's nothing 'supposed' about it- but based on your following comments you seemingly don't understand that the uni are in their right to remove the encampment. You believe it is a threat of violence to remove the encampment, but there's nothing inherently violent about that at all. The only violence would occur if encampment members fought back against the police doing their job in removing an illegal encampment. You agree the encampment is illegal, so don't understand your thought process there. 

Your example of UAW protests is so off base, I wouldn't continue using that as a serious example. UAW did not wall off sections of campus nor did they pop up dozens of living tents other than 1-2 temporary canopy's- not sure if they were permitted or not, but definitely such a different situation. The canopy's were taken down each day, so the analogy is very poor there and nothing to do with the cause. Rather, the illegal encampments being tolerated for so long indicates the opposite.",3,1715205275.0,t1_l36qe6t

Basically FAFSA changed the way they did things this year and delayed financial aid distributions for months, this happened at every school across the country. With that, how much aid you‚Äôre eligible for has changed and now if you have siblings in school it also won‚Äôt be worth as much.

Now it‚Äôs true that UCI is doing particularly bad with this and it‚Äôs because on top of the national FAFSA delays UCI basically crashed their internal financial aid system (i.e. the ‚Äútechnical difficulties‚Äù they‚Äôve been citing). From what I understand they also keep enrolling larger numbers of low-income students. 

While the federal money will stay the same (unless you got cut short with the new FAFSA calculator) UCI gets a set amount every year that they have to distribute among every student who‚Äôs eligible for aid. UCI grants and such aren‚Äôt federal money, that is school money.

1d25n2j,l6a1xab,kaleidoscopewoman,Yes I‚Äôve worked there since January. Join the data annotation Reddit and you‚Äôll learn everything you need to know. Dont take the assessment lightly do not take until you have read the Reddit thoroughly and time to take the whole thing and the qualifications after. Then it takes about 2-4 weeks to really get rolling and then you‚Äôll have more work than you can ever do! It‚Äôs awesome. I am a non coder and make about $25 an hour and coders make much more. Work whenever you want. You can cash out every three day and it‚Äôs depositors immediately to your PayPal. Only way they pay is to PayPal. When you‚Äôre accepted go fill out the personal profile under your name so it knows what kind of things you are knowledgeable in and they‚Äôll send you work.

1d25n2j,l6f1xov,Useful-Slip1020,"As someone working at a major defense prime and a recent CS graduate (Summer 2023), I‚Äôve experienced both pros and cons in this field. The benefits largely depend on the team you‚Äôre on, how you were hired, and your location. I secured a $110k TC offer in a low-cost-of-living (LCOL) area, which translates to about $150k+ in the OC/LA area and $175k+ in the Bay.

I‚Äôm working on an aircraft project rather than on internal tools at a tech company, which I find much more fulfilling. The job stability is excellent, and I don‚Äôt work on Fridays. In contrast, tech jobs can be less stable unless your team is highly rated and has a significant impact on the company, which is uncommon for new grads unless they‚Äôre exceptionally talented or lucky.

However, the pace in defense is often very slow. This can be beneficial for those who need a break after burning out, but it might become tedious if you‚Äôre looking to ramp up your workload. The tech industry, on the other hand, offers more dynamic career growth opportunities.

Defense industry experiences can be polarized; some people love it, while others criticize it harshly. There‚Äôs a notion that working in defense equates to ‚Äúselling your soul,‚Äù yet many of those critics are in CS for the high salary and demand. These same individuals might also be cutthroat in a corporate environment.

For me, the pros outweigh the cons, but it ultimately depends on your personal priorities. You could work in defense for a few years to gain experience and then move on when a better opportunity arises or the job market improves.

1d25n2j,l64n6op,[deleted],"Correct, as a trend, US CS (development, coding) offshoring is increasing with every year.

I've been thru many rounds of layoffs and generally my anecdotal observation is that management does the following

* freeze hiring new developers in the US
* layoff existing developers in the US
* hire offshore even when times are bad (LCOL, low salaries, affordable salaries from the management point of view)  10+ India developers for every 1 US developer.

Offshoring as a trend is likely responsible for the lackluster results and long fruitless job searches of US CS grads.  Thousands of applications, tens of phone interviews, single digits (1 or 2) in person interviews, 0 offers.

Increasing trends, over time, result in decreasing job prospects for new CS grads.  More time goes by, fewer onshore jobs.  That party will keep going until there's a war or some politically destabilizing event in Asia or Europe.",1,1716955441.0,t1_l64ljuy

But to answer your question, in general, the job boards all suck these days. When we place an ad we get bombarded with like 8000 fake applicants and it's hard to know what is real and what is what. It's like a reverse spam. Not a single candidate is qualified. They just show up to the interview and waste everyone's time. I don't understand the game they're playing honestly.

I'm not super familiar with recruiting in general, but if the fake/unqualified applicants are too overbearing, there are probably recruiting agencies of some sort that help with this through some form of pre-screening.

Not entirely sure why the email went out so late, but this is an opportunity for all of us to hopefully get some clarity on what's happening with financial aid and what steps are being taken to protect us as students from any negative consequence. I won't be able to attend, but I still don't have my aid either, so if anybody could give a play-by-play in this thread, much love in advance!

1) don't worry, I've forgotten most of what I've learned, too. This program has too much for nearly anyone to remember. What we come away with is awareness that these things *do* exist and, in our careers, we will go back and learn what we need again. 

2) stop pulling all nighters. Research indicates that sleep deprived people perform worse while *simultaneously* losing their ability to assess their performance. Meaning, it's affecting you severely but you can't tell. My performance started picking up when I started studying a bit less and sleeping more. You really gotta trust me, I was in your shoes and I used to try to justify the all nighters. 

3) we're in university -- a fairly competitive university. And within that competitive university, we're in a hard program. So keep this in mind: you're comparing yourself to really stellar people. 

4) you become your identity. This occurs because humans hate cognitive dissonance, and if you have a positive identity (i.e. I am competent, I am an engineer) your mind works to confirm that identity. Unconsciously, you are driven to prove yourself *right*.

If you are looking for community I'd recommend getting involved with ASME, the mechanical engineering org on campus, and going to the OAI study center. It's on the second floor of the rockwell engineering center, there's peer tutors for free as well as free snacks, coffee, and you will likely see people studying for the same classes you are in so you can help each other out.

It's easy to compare yourself to other people, I do it too, but remember they're probably struggling even when you don't see it. I was just talking to an engineering friend friend who's extremely goated, crazy GPA and extracurriculars and all that, and he's still terrified of not being able to get a job and pursue what he wants. Even if it doesn't seem like it we're all in this together. Also, even if you do get the grades you're looking for it won't fix your mental health and will more likely continue to come at the cost of it.

As far as suicidal thoughts, there's the counseling center on campus as well as the national 988 crisis line. You can call, text, or message through their online platform.

###The Government Accountability Office has released a pair of reports that shed new light on the troubled rollout earlier this year of the revamped Free Application for Federal Student Aid.

##Transcript

&gt; LEILA FADEL, HOST:
&gt; 
&gt; Millions of students rely on a form called the FAFSA to access federal financial aid, but the FAFSA is in turmoil.
&gt; 
&gt; A MART√çNEZ, HOST:
&gt; 
&gt; And now the public is getting an inside look into why. Federal investigators testified before lawmakers yesterday about what went wrong during the last cycle of FAFSA applications and what needs to be fixed for the next one.
&gt; 
&gt; FADEL: Cory Turner listened to their testimony, and he joins us now. Good morning, Cory.
&gt; 
&gt; CORY TURNER, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.
&gt; 
&gt; FADEL: So you've been reporting on federal investigations into the problems with FAFSA. What did investigators say they found when they testified yesterday?
&gt; 
&gt; TURNER: Yeah. House lawmakers heard from two investigators with the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office. And their report detailed 55 defects - essentially technological glitches - in the form that caused a lot of confusion for students and families. I'm just going to tick few - a few of them. For a while, students born in the year 2000 were mysteriously blocked from completing the form.
&gt; 
&gt; FADEL: OK.
&gt; 
&gt; TURNER: Students whose parent or spouse does not have a Social Security number were often forced by an error to go through a manual identity verification process that involves emailing documents directly to the department, which was really burdensome. Also, students' or parents' signatures sometimes just disappear when they return to the form. This is a problem GAO says still exists. I think it's also worth highlighting, Leila, GAO told lawmakers the Education Department wasn't forthcoming during this investigation either. Here's the GAO's Melissa Emrey-Arras.
&gt; 
&gt; (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
&gt; 
&gt; MELISSA EMREY-ARRAS: It was extremely challenging. It took us five months to receive documents that we had requested in March.
&gt; 
&gt; FADEL: Five months to receive documents - this all sounds like a mess. How did it impact students and their families?
&gt; 
&gt; TURNER: I mean, at the very least, it was incredibly frustrating. GAO found, during the early FAFSA rollout, nearly three-quarters of all phone calls, Leila, that came into the department's call center weren't even answered because the center was so understaffed.
&gt; 
&gt; FADEL: Wow.
&gt; 
&gt; TURNER: But it also goes way beyond frustrating. This overhaul was meant to make the FAFSA more accessible. But according to GAO, about 9% fewer high school seniors and other first-time applicants submitted a FAFSA, with the largest declines among lower-income students. Here's Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat.
&gt; 
&gt; (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
&gt; 
&gt; FREDERICA WILSON: I'm most upset that the delays and ongoing setbacks with FAFSA have meant that some of our want-to-be-somebody students have just decided not to go to college at all. They have just given up.
&gt; 
&gt; TURNER: This kind of concern from lawmakers in the hearing yesterday was bipartisan.
&gt; 
&gt; FADEL: You know, and as we're talking, it's September, almost October, which is the traditional start of the FAFSA cycle. But for the second year in a row, the Education Department has delayed the form's launch. So, Cory, are students and families going to face the same problems?
&gt; 
&gt; TURNER: Oh, that is the question. Well, the Ed Department released a report on Monday, trying to reassure folks that they have learned from these mistakes. The ed secretary has said he's put all hands on deck, including hiring 700 more call center workers. They're also not releasing the form in October, Leila, to give them more time to do beta testing, which is why the department says they're going to try to release it by December. But I will say this last rollout was such a mess. I don't know what to tell students and families, except maybe the old, be prepared for the worst but hope for the best.
&gt; 
&gt; FADEL: Well, there you go. NPR education correspondent Cory Turner. Thank you, Cory.
&gt; 
&gt; TURNER: You're welcome.",12,1727302223.0,t3_1fpdnmv

If homework is only weighted to be like 10% of your overall grade, but the exams were worth 90%, then doing ‚Äúabove average‚Äù on homework isn‚Äôt going to significantly impact your overall grade.

If you calc out your scores per the syllabus grading and it‚Äôs still off, talk to your professor about the discrepancy. 

Also take this as a lesson learned. I swear the only reason why I passed some of my classes is because I tried hard. I attended all the classes, sat near the front, participated, went to all TA office hours, went to a lot of professor office hours, and took any extra credit opportunities possible. Although I might‚Äôve scored low on exams, I think a lot were generous with grading when possible because they knew I was trying hard.

Apps were useless for me, but I found success talking to girls I was attracted to in my classes and major, through clubs/orgs, and other campus programs. I also got rejected more times than I can count, but that‚Äôs the nature of the game, and it taught me how to handle rejection better and not take them personally. Be open to talking to as many people as you can in any social setting, whether it be at school, at the gym, waiting in line at the coffee shop or grocery store, etc. A lot of people at this school seem super shy or unapproachable (headphones in, head down, RBF) but you‚Äôll be surprised how much they open up once you treat them like a decent human being. I‚Äôm pretty observant, so I find it relatively easy to strike up conversations with strangers. It also helps to have passions and hobbies because it makes you more relatable to others and gives you things to talk about. Lastly, presenting the best, most attractive version of yourself helps a lot in dating. To me, that means prioritizing diet and fitness, keeping a skincare routine, finding my own style and dressing well, having goals/ambition, and being outgoing and confident. Anecdotally, I have observed that a lot of males at this school don‚Äôt present themselves well in terms of hygiene, grooming, and fashion sense.

1fdnim9,lmhy7q0,AnteaterToAggie,"&gt; we honestly should be calling the dean of the school rather then Fasfa

The school deans have zero influence over Financial Aid. The hierarchy goes from the Chancellor &gt; Provost/EVC &gt; Vice Provost of Enrollment Management &gt; Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships. $20 says that everyone in that hierarchy already knows what's going on.

&gt; as it appears they no longer care about the students of this school.

That's your take based on your limited knowledge of the situation. 

&gt; And if we all collectively call the dean complaining and demanding something be done whether it be hiring more workers

Raining stress down on people via a synchronized campaign of ""demanding"" rarely accomplishes anything except for distract the people from doing the work. Ask anyone who has ever had a full-time job anywhere if it works.  

And ""hiring more workers"" wouldn't do what you think it does. These aren't mind-numb cogs just pushing a ""give money"" button. These are specialists in their field who only get experience by working in said field. No one goes to school to become a ""financial aid counselor"". It would take 30 days to get the necessary applications, another 30 days of interviews and decision-making, and then another 7-30 days of HR on-boarding before the person's allowed to sit behind a UCI desk and get paid for it. 

Then they have to learn everything about UCI's financial aid management system and then start handling all the hate and vitriol being showered on them by people who don't actually understand what the problem is or how to fix it. 

&gt; just demanding transparency with this entire thing

Again with the demanding... who's telling you that this works? Transparency can be good. Let's see what's being provided:

1. A list of all the FAFSA problems acknowledged: https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/topics/fafsa-simplification-information/2024-25-fafsa-issue-alerts
2. DAILY Updates: https://www.ofas.uci.edu/ . And here's yesterday's: https://www.ofas.uci.edu/9.09.24-Fall-Aid-letter-1.pdf

Do you want to know who is doing what at a given time of the day? That's not going to happen. If you want that detail, finish school, apply to join the UCI workforce, get into the Financial Aid Office, and put in the work so that you're authorized to keep tabs on the workers.  

&gt; Because how is it that many other UC‚Äôs who went through the same fafsa changes

""Many other UCs""... All UCs got hit by the changes, and the *errors* and the *late corrections*. Some got hit by more and with different types. And it's not just the UCs, but the CSUs CCCs, private schools, and all the schools outside of California as well. It's a big, national problem. You're only experiencing the UCI part of it.

1dguntt,l8wobc1,HamsterOk8828,lol to add on he was a dentist and periodontist who graduated from columbia,5,1718569491.0,t1_l8tk603
1dguntt,l8t3lbh,kandykane02,"as a grad, listening to it at first, i also felt like it was poorly written. and it seemed people around me and my friends felt the same way, but after some thought and reflecting on some things he said (err and the way he said), it was a pretty good speech for him personally

he mentioned that he is not the type of guy to really do this speech. i think he genuinely just donated to UCI since most of his employees graduated from the school of bio here, and the deans probably made me say something at commencement. on the way he awkwardly said some things, he mentioned he was an introvert, and his way of thinking is ‚Äúi just go for it‚Äù, which showed when it looked like he kind of just gave up on his commencement notes lol. but when he did, he was genuinely conversing with us about his success and how it is possible for us to achieve if we allow it to happen. 

takeaways that he said i thought were pretty insightful
1) to not be focusing on multiple things; just sticking to one thing and getting really good at it can help you in the long run (personally, i felt this as i was involved in many things in my 4 years, and looking back, i realize i never had great connections with anyone in all of my involvements as i always felt i had a limited time and energy for one thing before i felt obligated to contribute my time and energy to another)
2) how business is incorporated into almost every profession; yes, we‚Äôre not business majors, but almost all of us will be going into some type of industry, and his advice is to be aware that whatever industry we enter, it is still an industry
3) to achieve things with compassion; i don‚Äôt recall him saying anyone who personally had cancer to him or cystic fibrosis, but he continued to make biotech efforts for these conditions for the greater good, and i think that was genuine. (i‚Äôm applying to secondary school, and in my personal statement, i wrote about my mom having a stroke and how that made me decide what path to be on, and i can list a bunch of other people ive talked to with a sad or tragic story tied to their professional goals, but all in all story or not we all have or should have the genuine want to help patients and people)

overall, at first the speech sounded ass. BUT i kind of see it as his ‚Äòsuccess story‚Äô, and he is just passing down advice that he now knows and wants us to be aware of, avoid or pursue, as newly college graduates. congrats btw!!!!",77,1718505221.0,t3_1dguntt

But the point is, now you're advocating for yourself. Fantastic job getting them to finally look at your wrist and getting the help you actually needed. Keep advocating for yourself as I can promise you that it doesn't matter where you go, there are awful doctors that rush you in and out and don't give a damn and then there are doctors that clearly love what they do and are there for you.

For me, I do get anxious about time, and I sometimes feel behind people who are my age (I have friends who are well into their careers or in grad school) but I know that I had to take this much time to get here, and I am a much more prepared person for it. 

I won't get too into it, but I'm unpacking a lot of ""failure to launch"" stuff in therapy, and it has beem helpful. If you have to compare yourself to others, think of the 21 year olds who went through college aimlessly, or who also have regrets about their college experience. Nobody perfects anything, especially college. 

I would focus on the positive aspects of this difference, or not focus on it at all. My friends do not shame me for being older, and I am sure your classmates aren't shaming you, but are just surprised. You will have to forgive them their naivete. A lot of people don't get to go to college right away, or get through it at a different pace. A lot of people go back to school in their 30s &amp; 40s. Coming from 5 yrs in community college, I don't judge anyone for pursuing higher education at any age. 

I feel wiser and more mature than my peers. I find that I can provide something valuable to them.

1g124qa,lrde8ga,Fabulous_Survey_8103,"24 isn't really that old to be honest. It may seem like many people in your age ""have it together"", but most likely don't. Also, there's too many variables that come into play as to why some people finished sooner than others. From my personal experience, some of the people who graduated college before me are in massive debt that they will probably spend the rest of their life paying off.

I came in as a transfer student around your age in 2016, dropped out in 2017, enlisted in the military not long after, and got out at the start of 2024. I'm on my last year of undergrad and going to graduate debt free. I'm 31 and living my best life.  From my experience the ""feeling old"" is likely from how you keep comparing yourself to others. It's hard, but as you've already figured out by now, it isn't productive. Also, like someone previously mentioned, the ""younger"" crowd doesn't really pay attention. In reality, they're just trying to get through the class, just like yourself. 

Comparing is the thief of joy. Could you have graduated earlier? Yes, and so could have I. But you didn't and all you can do is focus on the now and finish what you started. Best of luck!",12,1728625137.0,t3_1g124qa

Most people wont think lesser of you because of your age or how long you have been in education. We all have different paths we can take. Only difference between us and them is that we took a different path. If you spend too much time worrying about others and comparing yourself to them, you'll forget about your own accomplishments and what you achieved.

2. Hamas is not a country. Gaza is not a country. Hamas is a group of Palestinians who has a military body and executive body for the sole purpose of negotiating for Palestinian rights. If you want to call the Palestinians in Gaza any country, they are technically in the sovereign land of Israel, except they cant vote in any elections on their own land and require a permit to work.

Hamas was elected into a position of power and committed a war crime which started this particular conflict. They killed civilians with no IDF personnel in sight, no military target. 

And if they were given absolute sovereignty who do you think would run that government? You think they would be cool with Israel (Jews) being next door?

You look at these conflicts with such a narrow point of view not considering any other geopolitical factors other than what you saw on TikTok.

E scooter riders tend to do 0 research and don‚Äôt understand riding etiquette and how to exist around others. A lot of e bike riders r the same. I don‚Äôt believe e scooters are stable or well designed (they aren‚Äôt meant to go as fast at they do) and I think most of those riders don‚Äôt understand how dangerous they‚Äôre being on a daily basis.

It's true that the drivers here kinda suck and the sidewalk can be safer for scooters and bikes, but if there are pedestrians on the sidewalk it's usually a good idea to assume they don't know you're there, even if they're walking towards you. Maybe get off the scooter and walk/run for like 10 feet and hop back on once you pass them. Nice thing about scooters is that you can step on and off really quickly. 

I know there are a lot of idiots glued to their phones with airpods in with zero situational awareness, but the fact is that as long as it's a sidewalk, they're supposed to be there and you're not - if you hit them (even as a result of someone walking into your path) it's still your fault 99% of the time

&gt;The buses were manufactured by BYD Motors,

UC Irvine was an early adopter and the number of manufacturers were few. [A LOT of organizations](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/la-metro-takes-delivery-of-first-zero-emissions-electric-buses-300075790.html) were scrambling and fighting for these buses. It was (and continues to be) the right thing to do... it's just that looking at the EV bus industry today shows which companies actually showed up with the best tech. Hindsight 20/20.

&gt;FC-1, was reportedly a ‚Äúproblem child‚Äù before being removed from service in summer 2019.

The fuel cell bus was a boon for the time ([2015](https://www.apep.uci.edu/In_The_News_First_Hydrogen_Fuel_Cell_Bus_On_A_UC_Campus.html)) and the fact that it lasted 4 years as an experimental bus and all the data collected is valuable for HFC research.

&gt;The operator described electric bus technology as not ‚Äúfully fleshed out,‚Äù

It depends on the company and the model year. New Flyer's modern EV buses seem pretty good. First-gen US BYD has had problems. Proterra went into bankruptcy and EVERYONE with Proterra buses is suffering as a result. That's not UCI's fault. UCI's a victim.

&gt;Considering California‚Äôs $20 fast food minimum wage policy, which started in April 2024, Anteater Express no longer pays more than comparably accessible jobs for UCI students.

I think the author intended to say that the jobs aren't as *competitive* as they were before. Regardless, that's not the fault of UCI and it also doesn't make the driver wage any *less* than it was prior to the fast food wage increase*.* It's just that a certain segment of the population is making more.

The last thing worth noting is that bus systems that act as ""common carriers"" (allow the general public to ride) are eligible for federal and state funds which tend to make up MASSIVE amounts of their budgets. UCI doesn't get that. It's harder for UCI than, say, OCTA or even the MUCH SMALLER Irvine Shuttle.",13,1715044778.0,t3_1cloqzf

1gmbbde,lw5l70p,chabuano,"Hey! As a counselor/therapist in training (not at UCI, just in general) with a social justice and advocacy lens, I want to provide everyone with a bit of context.

Counselors assess suicidal ideation based on evidence-based tools and assessments. If someone is found to be in an unsafe situation, counselors have an ethical and legal obligation to ensure their safety. When working at a university or managed care facility, this means counselors have to follow a written protocol that tells them exactly what to do. Counselors do not have the freedom or power to stray from the protocol. They *have* to contact the police if that‚Äôs what the policy is.

It would be a good idea for the community to advocate for the university to add alternatives to police/hospitalization to their safety protocols. Counselors are doing our best to make sure that everyone they meet with is safe, and there are clear guidelines for what that looks like. In cases like the above, counselors *must* follow the protocol and do what the university dictates they do. 

That does not mean we care any less or want to do harm. We do this work because we care about your wellbeing, and most of all, your safety. The counselor you saw failed to provide you with the reassurance and care that you needed at that time, which isn‚Äôt fair to you.

My first advice is to breathe a little, I know you‚Äôre in an extremely stressful position that must constantly be on your mind right now, but this will end, and you will be ok. 

On to your issues, usually they do an appeal process if you have not already done one. I can‚Äôt promise this course of action will be available, I haven‚Äôt been there in years, but this is a usual practice where you have to sign something that says you will improve your grades. 

You need to ask yourself why you‚Äôve been failing. I know you outlined some reasons in your post, but I think it would be good to a deep soul search, realize what is impacting you the most, and work to actively change it next quarter. Only you will know how to do this for yourself to succeed, but talking to others and reaching out to support networks is good! 

Lastly, I went back to community college, transferred to a Cal State, and ended up less financially stressed and happier as a person for it. FAFSA covered me because I was older than 26, broke and independent of having to declare any parental income, which wasn‚Äôt much to begin with. I am now much healthier and happier, and I remember when I was in your position I wanted to disappear completely. 

My friend earns a fantastic living doing clinical trial work having graduated with only a Bachelor‚Äôs in Public Health Science from UCI. You might not have to do a Master‚Äôs program if you broaden your options, it sounds like school is stressful for you and it was for me too!

i‚Äôd recommend a few things
i‚Äôd first try to reach out to get a social worker, talk to a counselor or professor who can get you connected with one
get in touch with all resources like counselors and basic needs so you don‚Äôt have to worry abt anything else and they can reach out or advocate in ur behalf to fight for u to stay 
if that doesn‚Äôt work out, finish the rest of ur classes at a community and transfer back in- if you keep ur grades up &amp; come back in not only would it improve your GPA significantly for PA school it would also show an upward trend, which is very important for PA. PA/OT and other grad schools in the healthcare industry care abt showing upward trends, persistence, dedication, &amp; commitment to service. once u feel well enough and back on ur feet, whether that‚Äôs community college with free education or getting counseling through therapy that‚Äôs offered free at most colleges including at UCI free through UC Ship (and even without ship you do get a diagnosis and a few sessions and help) you can work on getting clinical work experience which is most important for grad school admissions in healthcare. the work experience can also help you save up for other expenses which might make your load a bit easier life wise. i‚Äôd also try to apply to as many scholarships and reaching out to professors to explain your story.
also- you can take classes online through the UC cross campus enrollment and take classes at a community college WHILE ur enrolled at UCI- those classes online through uc cross campus (which u can take at any uc that offers it) count for credit for any of the courses u might need, you just have to see how it matches up (DM for specific instructions about this).
you will definitely be able to go to college- if you work on fixing it now and get your grades up and show persistence and explain your difficult situations i‚Äôm sure so many will understand- ur not alone! u can get through this. you can stay with ur degree or start over, but it all begins once you actually reach out to get help. your overall GPA can be calculated differently bc UCI calls all the classes you‚Äôve taken at a UC ur ‚ÄúUC‚Äù gpa while community college is seperate, but for PA or a healthcare grad school it‚Äôs usually calculated for science and non science GPA. regardless though, what matters most is an upward trend which you can start working on right now.

I almost failed out of the engineering school multiple times while I was dealing with my own struggles. I was allowed to stay because I showed enough interest (I'd always have a great grade in some engineering class, even if every other major-related class was an F) and worked with counselors a lot. In hindsight, I was too dumb to realize that the major I was in wasn't a good fit for me and I should've changed to another engineering major, but it's all water under the bridge now. I know it doesn't feel like it when you're in college, but it ends eventually. In many (probably most) cases, once you have your first career job, people barely look at your education on your resume, if they look at all. That may not be the most comforting reply, but I'm speaking from my own personal experience. It was hard for a while (college was pretty meh for me overall to be honest, largely my own fault), but I got through it, figured out what I actually want to do (working in audio product development, so thankfully, my education was close enough to get my foot in the door), and now I have a fantastic job that I love and pays well.

I am now in a masters at UCI facing the same problems. Work with your advisor.  See a therapist. Map out a plan that works for you. Get your advisor to buy into that plan. Consult with affinity groups on campus that can also work with your advisor to advocate for you. Consider getting screened for a disability/learning difference through the DSC (but you‚Äôll need to work with your own doctor to diagnose this and communicate it to DSC).

I was told I‚Äôd be dropped out of the school if I didn‚Äôt decide on my major and switch to the school but the issue was all of my classes taken so far were for me to major in sociology rather than business admin. I was upset when they told me this because going into college I wasn‚Äôt sure exactly what I wanted to do so my advisor recommended completing my GEs until I decided and so majority of the classes I took were to fulfill the GE requirements and it ended up messing me up in the long run. And because of that and my grades I couldn‚Äôt get into the business school. I talked to several advisors and only one seemed to help and told me my best option is to major in something I didn‚Äôt want (sociology) but graduate from UCI or transfer. I thought of going to community college and going that route and even looked around at schools in the area or LA but I didn‚Äôt have any of the required classes taken already to be accepted into most business programs. I decided to transfer to a way smaller university out of California and now I‚Äôm in marketing and able to get the help I need and hopefully graduate on time.

If your parents had a reduction in their income in 2023, you can submit an appeal through your Zot Aid Portal. You can go to your Documents tab, click Upload a Non Requested document, and click Special Circumstances Student SAI Adjustment.

**How do I accept aid without accepting loans**

Hi. You do not have to accept loans for your Gift Aid to be accepted. Gift Aid is auto-accepted.

Any grants or scholarships awarded will be automatically accepted. Any loans being offered will need to be manually accepted by the students. If you do not wish to accept loans the documents will remain pending throughout the academic year because you are welcome to go back and accept it if needed.

**If I have received my financial aid through ZotAid, but still haven't had the loan amounts come through ZotAccount, will I be dropped from my classes on Monday if it doesn't come by then? Thank you.**

You will not be dropped from your classes. We will begin credits to Zot Account soon.

**Hello I just had a question regarding my account, it says my account has been placed on financial hold on 6/23/2024 but my email of award came through the email, I accepted my award and it doesn‚Äôt show case on my fall quarter fees on the zot account.**

Your Financial Tab on Zot Aid will be visible soon. Some students have received access again but some students are still under review.

**Why is there still an option for loan counseling if I have denied loans?**

The task for loan counseling will remain just in case you wish to take out loans in the future. As long as you decline your student loans in step 2 and do not complete the tasks in step 3, the loans will not pay out. You can disregard the pending tasks for the loans if you do not wish to utilize them.

The loan counseling will remain in your portal in case you decide to accept the loan at a later date during the year.

**On my zot aid portal the university loan appears as automatically accepted on step 2 even though I declined it in the 2024-2025 Institutional Loan Acceptance Form in the document section. Will this be updated later and will the university loans not be accepted?**

If you have decline the University loan it will not be disbursed. There is a Master Promissory Note that needs to be completed with ECSI which is the loan servicer, in order for us is to process the loan. Without the acceptance and MPN we cannot disburse or process the loan.

**If i waive the USHIP do i lose the USHIP grant**

**if we accept out maximum amount of loans (ex. i was able to accept up to 7500) is that for the whole year as a total, or is it 7500 per quarter?**

---

Of income due to unemployment where we really just need, you know, documentation of unemployment. So depending on the complexity and the necessary documents in order to support that appeal, you're going to see some differences in timeline. Generally, once we have the appeal, it can take probably a minimum of 10 days and sometimes a little longer on that. But what I would say at the point that you do submit that appeal, our counselors.
Are immediately looking at those and we are immediately.
Letting our families know exactly what type of documents we may need from you. And we do stay in constant contact with you. At that point, it becomes a more very more intimate conversation and we're trying to let you know where we are in your appeal and how much longer that appeal may take. And that's going to be some personal communication that you will have with our counseling team.
Thank you.
I am continue to see questions about the consent for release of financial aid information form. And I just want to reiterate for those who joined late, that is not a requirement. You will only submit that document if there is an individual in your life that you would like to grant access to your student financial aid application and student record information. So that could be a parent, a guardian, a spouse, but that is not a required document. You have your your information is protected by federal.
Laws and that form is only intended if there's someone in your life that you would grant access. Like if your spouse wants to call in and ask a question about your financial aid application, we can't discuss it with them unless they you've completed this form on their behalf. So that is not a requirement that is optional for students that it applies to.
I'm also going to answer a question, Becky, about a student. There's a few students who will not be here the entirety of next year because they're going to graduate in the fall or winter quarters, and they're asking about receiving all of their financial aid perhaps in the fall or the winter because they won't be here.

Congratulations on graduation. Your financial aid award is for the entire year. It's divided equally. It disperses at the beginning of each term equally in thirds across the fall, winter and spring quarters. If you do not attend 1/4, you simply do not receive aid for that quarter that you do not attend. So if you're going to graduate at the end of fall, you'll receive a third of your financial aid offer in the fall and then.
Cross that stage and and off into the world.
Uh, yes, the housing confirmation document is a requirement. Umm, if your housing plans have changed, uh, you will want to uh, notify us, uh, by re uploading that document with the change in your housing status so that we can ensure you have an accurate financial aid award.
Yeah. And to touch on that, especially for our continuing students, I know that is not a form you would historically see from us or be asked from us. That is one of the changes in the 2425 FAFSA.
They, they would be last year they asked you within the FAFSA what your housing plans were, whether you're going to be living on campus, off campus, or at home with your family. They took that question off for 2425. So it has.

Nationwide required financial aid office to determine your housing, uh, status so that we can put you in the financial aid, umm, budget that correlates with where you're living. So I know for many of you, this is the first time seeing that, but yes, it is required so that we can make sure that your financial aid, umm, is specific to where your housing is.

Thank you. I do have a question from a student about their NAOP grant for our Native American, American Indian or Native Alaskan students. You will want to ensure that you've uploaded your documents and we will approve you and get that award on there. You already should have done a FAFSA or Cadiz. You will fall into that protected group of students that is not at risk and on that line.
Questions from a Cal Vet fee waiver student who is very anxious to have their question answered. They do not plan to complete a FAFSA, but they're intending to receive a Calvet fee waiver and I would.
Encourage you to try and get on the phone to a representative, but if you are a continuing student you won't need to worry because we know that you received it in a prior year.
Some more work study questions, Becky. For a student that's never worked before and is interested, how can they find employment opportunities?
Employment opportunities are you can go to the the career pathways website and there is a tab actually I think it's an app and I believe it's called Handshake. So a handshake is where you will find all on campus employment opportunities. And so we're going to direct you to that area to look for those opportunities.


Thank you. Do you have any words to share with our students who still may be waiting on a financial aid offer? I know the majority of our students have received their offers, but there is a group of those, the special circumstances you mentioned earlier. Do we have any words to share with them on those attending aid offers?

Yeah. So, yeah, it's a great question. So when you know, when I spoke earlier about certainly the feed deadline that's that's coming up on September 16th that is extended to all of our financial aid recipients. We understand that we still do have some students that do need some individual care from us to resolve their financial aid.
Maybe you have just turned in some financial aid documents.

That were requested from us to be able to verify some information you provided on the FAFSA. You may have a special circumstance appeal. You may be a mixed status family. There is a lot of different individual scenarios out there that we are actively working on. Your classes will not be dropped. We are working with you individually to send those financial aid out offers out to you. We do want you to keep an eye on on your documents tab though I know we've said.
Has intermittent service to you, but if you have any documents that still need to be turned in in order for us to process your financial aid, we want to make sure that you go there and complete those as soon as possible so that they can go to my counseling team who can review them and then provide you a financial aid offer as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Umm.

Let's see lots of repeat questions about loans that we've already answered. And I do want to reiterate that this this town hall session is being recorded and will be posted on our website so you can revisit some of the topics that have already been covered and addressed multiple times.

I am.
11 question If you don't plan to borrow a loan, you don't need to take any action.
And.

You have realized you made a mistake on your FAFSA. You can return to your FAFSA application and make a correction at this time and then we will receive the results. And then if that change warrants a change to your financial aid award offer, that will be an automatic process and you'll get an award update e-mail. It is not too late to make a change to that financial aid application if you.
Realized that you made an error.",1,1726193455.0,t3_1ffickn
1ffickn,lmv7o5w,YummySpamMusubi,"A good question, Becky. Could you explain what the federal funds authorization form is?
Sure. So if you, we want to make sure that if you have uh, prior balances on there and you would like your financial aid to be applied to pay for those that you have to give us permission to do that. So currently the policy, the federal policy is the air financial aid can only be applied to current charges. Umm, so in order to apply those to anything prior to this academic year, you must give us permission to.
So that's something that we that we are not able to do that automatically on your behalf.

OK. And I know we've shared this as well, but you've shared that students will not be dropped from classes at fee deadline. Is there going to be a late payment fee assessed?
No, you will not receive any late payment fees and that's including housing.

Anything at this point, there are no late fees going to be applied to any of our students.
OK.

Let's say, yeah, some more questions about if they pay out of pocket now and then later.

Receive financial aid or complete their requirements and receive financial aid. Will they get their out of pocket payment back? And yes, we've answered that question. It will.

Yeah. And I, you know, I do want to touch on that a bit more because I've, I've been asked that particular question several times. You have the option to make a payment for your bill right now, but I don't want to place any of our families in a financial hardship of paying out of pocket when you are expecting financial aid to cover the full charges that we have assessed on your ZOB bill. So if you're financial aid is supposed to.
Your entire bill, I, I don't want you to feel that you have to make a payment from your own bank account or credit card or anything like that. I don't want to place you in a situation again where you're in a financial burden. If you have an financial aid that should cover everything. So I just want to be very clear on that. And certainly, you know, we can talk afterwards, you know, offline if, if you have a specific scenario you want me to talk to you about.


I, I don't, you know, it concerns me that you feel like that's just something that you're required to do. You are not required to do that. And, and I don't want you to feel pressure to do that either.
OK.
Lots of repeats here.

I'm going to put some go back to some of the slides that seem to be repeat questions so that we're sitting on those. Those are displayed.

I'll rotate through some of the more frequently asked questions that that are addressed on the slides and this will be posted later for review, but a lot of these.
I have been addressed.
Verification documents can you expand on?
Mm-hmm.

Verification and whether or not that has to be completed before before fee deadline.
So let me explain a little bit 1st about what verification is. The Department of Education, when you complete your FAFSA, the Department of Education selects about 30% of our applicants for a process called verification. And that is basically we are asking our families to validate what they put on the FAFSA does match up to their tax information and other documents that we may ask for. If you are one of those families that has been selected for verification, we already asked for those.
Documents in your document page of of the required documents that we need to review prior to sending you a financial aid offer.

So if you haven't completed those, we're asking that you complete them very soon so that we can review and offer you an eventual aid notification on there. But as far as the fee deadline, you know, and I, I, I'll say it 10 more times tonight because I want to make sure everyone is really clear about this. If you are a financial aid recipient, if you have completed a FAFSA, if you had completed a CATA.
Whether you have completed the financial aid verification process, whether you still have missing documents, whether we still need to review your classes will not be dropped. We will not drop your classes on the 16th.
There's some language clarification being requested and what you mean by cata.

Yeah, Makati, it stands for California application for, I would say like wrong. So these are California Dream applications. These are for AB 540 students who are undocumented. So it's our California Dream application.
Can you talk about when blue and gold can be expected or the the share anything about blue and gold?
Yeah, historically we process your Blue and gold in October and the reason we need to wait for October is we have to wait for any other outside scholarships to be applied first. So the blue and gold program promise can be fulfilled, umm, through Cal Grant. If you have a Cal Grant then umm, you would not be expecting umm a blue and gold scholarship because it does fulfill the full system wide tuition.

There are several questions about students who still have pending residency.

That hasn't been umm, they haven't received a decision yet about pending residency and that impact to their financial aid offer.
Yeah. I don't know if you want to speak to that one, Crystal. I know it's a little bit more nuanced and how we provide the financial aid offer based on those.

Yeah, essentially if that status is still pending, then you've been offered financial aid as an out of state student and I used it sounds like least quite the individuals asking us questions are already working with the residency officers. So that's exactly what you need to do. And as soon as the determination is made if you are deemed to be a California resident, then we will repackage you and offer you financial aid that you're eligible to receive as a California resident.
And that will happen automatically.
If you do have any questions about.
Residency, you can send an e-mail to the residency officers. They're available at regres@uci.edu. That's REGRE s@uci.edu and they will ensure that you have all the information you need.
Let's see.
Does the student need to borrow both a subsidized loan and an unsubsidized loan or they can they only borrow 1?
No, the whatever we have offered you for a student loan, that is your option to borrow one or both. If I were to recommend what I would say is the better loan, the subsidized loan is always going to be the better loan every day of the week. That particular loan you are not occurring any interest while you're in school and interest only starts occurring on that loan six months after UCC be at least half time, which typically is after graduation.

From school. So the subsidized loan is the better loan. The unsubsidized loan you do start incurring interest at the point of your first disbursement. So it's at the point that it is applied to your ZOP bills. When you start occurring interest on that one it is relatively low interest rate, but it still is a current interest and it does capitalize over time. If you want to make sure that it's not going to be having interest, you know occurring during your education here you do have the.

Option to contact your loan servicer and ask them to bill you corally for the interest that may be occurring on the. So that's a good way to kind of save on, you know, the rising cost of interest year after year. So that's an option to you, but that's something that you would have to reach out to them specifically to ask them to do. Otherwise that interest just keeps going on that particular loan. The the university loan is also a great loan. It's, it's also better than the unsubsidized loan. It's not a Korean interest while you're in school.

Very low interest rate. The parent PLUS loan does accrue interest while you're in school and the parent would have to contact their particular loan servicer if they wanted to be billed for the loan interest. But they also would have to request that the PLUS loan if they don't want to make payments on that because repayment does begin immediately on the parent PLUS loan. If they want that deferred, they would have to reach out to their loan servicer to ask for that deferment.
So that they don't have to pay it while you're in school.

And I want to be mindful to your time. I know that we are 5 minutes past umm, the time that we've allotted for this. I'm completely fine staying in here as long as you have questions you want to direct towards me. Umm. But for those umm, that feel like they want to drop off and umm, I do want to thank you very much for the time that you've offered me to answer some of your questions. I hope this has been useful to you and helpful to help you understand.
The changes in your financial aid offers this year.

It goes without saying that I'm extremely grateful for your patience and your understanding. I completely understand that has been a very, very hard year for you. And, and, and I accept that. And, and as the financial aid director here, I, I, I do want to tell you how deeply I care for each and every one of you. There is a reason that I chose this as my career in the industry that I work in, I believe very much.
Open Access and affordability to education, and it has been an honor to serve as a financial aid director here.

We are only going to get better and and that is the promise that I you can take from me. Every day we are getting better and better at resolving these situations and the frustrations. I understand they're out there and like I said, I accept those. I accept those. And so like I said, I'm going to stay on here for as long as you need me this evening to get the answers that you need. But in the meantime, for the rest of you, feel free.
To enjoy the rest of your evening.
And and feel free to keep going to our homepage for updates and to call us if you need necessary. I just thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm yes, and thank you, Patty.
Thank you. Thank you, Crystal.",1,1726193559.0,t1_lmv7e6v
1ffickn,lmv8ars,YummySpamMusubi,"I do have a repeating question, Becky, you shared some specifics about the qualifications for the Anteater grant and I did just want to qualify that students that were selected to participate in that program qualified the year that they entered UCI, so their first year that they entered.
Yes.
So students now may meet that definition because of the changes to the the FAFSA formula, but you would have needed to qualify as an entering student to be participate.
Yes, thank you for that clarification.
So.
I'm going to keep I'm going to keep toggling around to some of these slides.
I do see people are dropping off and going about their evening.
Umm.
Let's see, there's a question about summer financial aid for next summer, I assume because we've concluded summer 2024 and that year has ended. Umm, so do students need to rely for summer financial aid?
Yeah, I can speak to that. So summer is considered a trailer, which means it's the last term of the academic year. So there will be a separate summer financial aid application, umm, that will be available. Usually it's available, I want to say in March, umm, umm, March of next year. So that's when we will provide that application. Umm, summer is a little bit different than the academic year. There's multiple mini sessions within there, so we're going to be asking for some.
All information and how many classes you're going to take and which sessions you're going to take them in and.

Because it is a trailer as far as the types of aids that you would be eligible for, if you're eligible for Pell Grant, you will receive an additional disbursement for that particular term. But student loans, the amount that you would be available for would be if you have borrowed during the academic year. If you haven't received the full amount of your loans during the academic year, the remaining eligibility would be applied towards summer.
But we've provided the maximum amount of loans.
Within your academic year, so it would only be the remaining portion. Anything that you haven't borrowed would be available for summer. But we have some additional summer grants and there that are a little bit different than the academic year. But again, that application will open up in March of 2025 and then we will start to provide financial aid offers within that session.
I put a link to the step by step except your loan instructions in the chat for those of you asking.
Let's see.
OK.

There's a question about will there be efforts made to increase the UCI grant budget?
I want to make sure.
Yeah, I know. I'm trying to figure it out.
And I know that's a complicated question because we received support from the state of California.
The complicated formula.
Yeah, this, this is yeah. So the financial aid that you have been provided for two thousand 2425 is accurate so.
Hey.

There would not be adjustments to your current financial aid unless your circumstances change through an appeal that you may have through US. So there wouldn't be any adjustments to the UCI grant unless they have the specific scenarios to them. You're financially you do reapply every year you you complete a new FAFSA. You know in January the 2526 FAFSA will be open and so based on.
The demonstration of need you have within that new facility year, your UCI grant can see adjustments within from year to year. Certainly for our continuing students, they're seeing some differences from last year to this year that we discussed earlier. So I hope that answers your question. I, I, I don't, not sure if you were relating it to this year or next year, but I wanted to make sure it kind of covered all the bases there.
Yeah, they're gonna keep toggling around here on the slides.
And I just want to confirm if you received an e-mail award notification, that means that your financial aid offer is available to view. If you have not received an award, there are still activity happening on application and an award is being finalized. So it's not until you receive that official e-mail financial aid offer e-mail notification from us.
Directing you to view that award. I know some of you are referencing the college financing plan. That tab is a tool available in the Zot Aid portal if you do not yet have a financial aid offer and that form will appear as blank. Once you have a financial aid offer, it automatically populates with your award information. So that's why you're seeing a college financing plan.
That has zeros because your financial aid offer is not yet available.

There's still some questions about the intermittent access issue with the aid portal. We are we are pushing for resolution with Oracle and I would just say I keep trying until we have more information to share and we are maintaining the updates on the FAQs on our home page. There is a red emergency button up at the top of our home page. If you click on that, it will have a running.
Blog of all of our daily updates and as soon as we have confirmation that that our system environment has been stabilized, will be very, very happy and grateful to share that news with you.
There that today we are hearing things have been stable on the platform throughout the day so.
Fingers crossed, but today has been a good day in that regard. But we'll keep vigilant on that.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
And students are asking questions comparing their previous year's EFC to their Sai and that's there's really not an equivalency anymore. I don't know if you want to expand on that, Becky.
Yeah, We do have some FAQs on our website that does talk about the differences between the EFC, which was the estimated family contributed to the Sai, which is the student aid index. It is not apples to apples. And so the comparances are vast. There used to be over 120 questions on the FAFSA and now there's 18. So if if that.
Illustrates.

The vastness of changes and how that financially formula has changed for a lot of our students and how it has affected umm, how your need has been determined about what type of financial aid it, it's pretty big. I think some of the, the big things that we're looking at, umm, you know, certainly when we have the EFC, it did take into account if there was more than one student in college.
And there would be a formula to be able to provide.
That student with additional financial need because they're they're putting more than one student through college. That's something that they removed from the 2425 FAFSA. And so that's no longer within the formula at all and it's not being calculated. So that's that's a drastic difference that our that our students are seeing and there is, you know, a lot of different scenarios where it's.
Looking at assets differently and.
It's looking at private business income differently, it's looking at farm assets differently. So the the formula is just.
A complete upside down of of how we can look at last year and how we can look at this year. And, and certainly we knew especially for our continuing students, this was going to be.
Something that was, you know, kind of confusing because your financial aid as a continuous student should look fairly similar from year to year, so long as the income didn't change drastically and there's no additional income provided. So, you know, a family last year that had an income of X amount and this year they have income of the same amount.
Your financial aid can look very, very different.
OK. Thank you for that explanation.
Umm, I'm going to tab over to another loan.
Uh, OK.

Chancelor states that there is no ""strong"" risk of injury or harm to students from the evidence. So they're just going to let it spiral out lf control until it does? No, they've enacted action to correct this behavior. Whether he takes those lessons to heart, only time will tell.

I was interested because I was recently trying to relocate to a particular 'college town' basically because south Florida has become ridiculously priced.  Homes here are not priced according to the house, but anything in the Broward County/Miami-Dade County areas pretty much require an athlete's multi year contracted salary and Mother Teresa's credit score, to buy.  And rentals are worse. Anyway, I requested details on several apartments and some houses, solely because the rent was wonderfully priced, many under $700./mo.  A price unheard of in south Florida since the '90s.  I was prepared to sign a lease, sight unseen, except for the virtual tour until my world was crushed, I found out those awesome rentals involved sharing the unit with multi-random strangers, and on top of that, the random multiple strangers would be COLLEGE students.  Remembering who I was and what I did in college, I immediately unpacked my boxes, remade my bed, and ignoring the luggage, fell deeply asleep in my quiet home.

1ei17tn,lg88yi1,[deleted],"Hi I live like 30 min away without traffic but I'm in ACC.

I think if you can afford it, even if you are within 30 min away, life is a lot better if you choose to live on-campus b/c you get more of the college experience. It becomes a lot harder to go to events or coordinate with friends if you have to get through the mental block of driving 30 min just to get there. You also gain more independence and are able to have more freedom than if you were in your parent's house. These benefits are less pronounced when you're 5 min away vs. 30 min away, but I still think regardless people should be able to have a better college experience if they want it.

I don't think invalidating people who make that decision as ""getting away from mommy and daddy"" is really productive. We didn't cause the housing crisis, and we certainly didn't drive up rent on you guys. You can blame the ACC, the Irvine Company, and UCI accepting more and more incoming freshmen than they can house instead for that.

Hating on people who are rich or privileged for causing your problems is easy. I won't lie they probably have it much better than people who have to commute 1hr+ just to get to campus, or people who haven't yet found housing even after looking for a long time. In the end of the day though I feel like it's misdirected hate, like there is no winning the misery game. How is hating on lil timmy that lives 5 min away gonna change the system? You can ask for UCI to make it so that you have to prove your permanent residence is a certain number of miles away, but I think it's a lot better if we ask UCI instead to accept less freshmen and give 4-year guaranteed housing, or for ACC to have fixed rent prices.",4,1722645292.0,t3_1ei17tn
1ei17tn,lg8gbt8,Hot-Concentrate-443,"Hi there! So like many of us have said before, a 30 minute drive is honestly not that bad. It's honestly a privilege to live that close to a great university. Many people make that kind of drive to their workplaces every day. Also wouldn't it be more cost effective than having to spend more money on rent/utilities/food/etc? I agree, UCI should have more housing. However, I think some people (aka the ones who live closer to campus) should think about how they're decisions can affect others. To put it bluntly, I think it's very selfish to take a spot from someone who needs it more. For example, one of the comments on here mentioned that their friends had to TRANSFER OUT OF UCI because they didn't get housing. That's actually so sad. Also when it comes to being rich/privileged, I'm one of them. I'll be real. My family has money, so that's not really where this is coming from. I don't think anything is gonna change the system LMFAO, I just think people should really think about their choices. AGAIN, I AGREE THAT UCI IS NOT GREAT FOR THEIR DECISIONS TO NOT HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING. But this is about thinking about each other so we can all have a great college experience. I have commuter friends who do just fine finding social circles who are involved in clubs and spend a lot of time on campus. I don't understand this whole ""commuters can't make friends"" thing because every commuter I have interacted with seems to be having just as great of an experience as people who live in on-campus housing.",-3,1722648233.0,t1_lg88yi1
1ei17tn,lg8pyj4,[deleted],"I don't disagree with most of what you're saying. I'm just coming from the perspective of ""don't hate the player, hate the game."" It's great to think about how your decisions can affect other people, but to be honest I think choosing to live close to campus when you live nearby is NOT a selfish decision. 

To clarify, I'm not saying commuters can't make friends, I'm just saying it's more difficult. That also wasn't the main point; the main point was there is a convenience and time factor that you're giving up by commuting. Also, another clarification, when I was talking about ""hating on rich or privileged"" I didn't mean only monetarily privileged, I also meant privileged to be living close to campus.

Let's say a person decides to be more thoughtful and commutes instead of living in ACC. I'm not sure how much of a measurable difference you'll get in terms of more people that need housing actually getting housing. On top of that I would ask why is there a system like that in the first place? This person never ""took"" the spots of people who couldn't find housing. Those spots never existed. How could they be selfish for choosing a spot that was rightfully given to them? Why should they feel the need to give up the spot that was theirs because UCI did not allocate enough housing for its residents? That's not their problem, that's UCI's problem. 

To reiterate, it was UCI's decision to give them housing over other people, not theirs. Sure that affects other people, but so does everything in life. When you choose to accept a job, maybe someone needs it more than you. When you choose to go to a college, maybe someone else was more qualified than you. In the end of the day though, I don't think it's productive trying to be 100% thoughtful in every decision you make. You just make the decision and understand that other people might have it worse.

If you want to be empathetic, something that's more useful is looking at giving tips or other housing advice for people trying to find off-campus housing besides ACC. You can also protest or organize things to change the system. Otherwise, if you don't think you can change the system, getting mad at people for accepting their housing despite living close is in my opinion, misguided. I also think that not choosing to live on campus just because you already live close is misguided (assuming you don't mind the extra cost).",2,1722652235.0,t1_lg8gbt8
1ei17tn,lg95sz6,Hot-Concentrate-443,"I understand your point, I really do. I still disagree. This isn't something as permanent like a job, this is college housing. Also, it is selfish to want housing, that's just a fact. Now do I think people do it out of malice? No. Everyone just wants their own experience. However, I think it's ignorant to do that sort of thing and not see the bigger picture. In your words, I see the decision as very misguided. Like I've said, I still blame ACC/UCI for some of this because it is awful that there isn't enough housing for everyone. However it is not possible to get them to just build more housing because it would not be done in time for an upcoming school year (obviously haha) But at the end of the day, I'd rather have that person living hours away have a place to live than someone who just wants to get away from their parents who live 30 minutes or less away. You can have your opinion and that's fine, I just respectfully disagree with it. I will be pissed at people who live closer who chose to take those spots (assuming their home situation is fine).",-3,1722659636.0,t1_lg8pyj4

1d1yy4o,l5yczqa,[deleted],"Hi, so even though I know this is only tangentially related to this post, the UC Regents' investment committee did have a meeting about their investments just a couple of weeks ago. In it, they disclosed that they have $3.3 billion invested in weapons manufacturing companies. Here is the original video source of the part of the meeting where they discussed this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83rqz-UuWro&amp;t=6327s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83rqz-UuWro&amp;t=6327s)

In addition, for a tl;dr, here's the news article that summarized the meeting: [https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/14/uc-regents-disclose-investments-in-weapons-manufacturers-amid-calls-to-divest](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/14/uc-regents-disclose-investments-in-weapons-manufacturers-amid-calls-to-divest) .

  
As you can imagine with most of Israel's weapons coming from America ( [https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/18/23966137/us-weapons-israel-biden-package-explained](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/18/23966137/us-weapons-israel-biden-package-explained) ), there is a high likelihood that these weapons being manufactured are going directly to the Israel-Gaza conflict, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have died, including 85% displaced from their homes ( [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/middleeast/gaza-death-toll-palestinians.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/21/world/middleeast/gaza-death-toll-palestinians.html) ).",14,1716853837.0,t1_l5y5nff
1d1yy4o,l5yfxf5,Throwaway729032,"Thank you for providing a source. It is nice to hear the exact number of how much they have invested into these companies, but the question arises to should they even divest? These weapons manufacturers make so much of what we need in our essential lives because they‚Äôre not just weapons manufacturers, they‚Äôre also tech and resource suppliers. Almost all our tech we buy and use can be traced back to these companies, so in a way are we not all supporting Israel? We don‚Äôt actively choose to support them and I believe Bachner says so too. 

My dad is pilot, and he flies a Boeing aircraft. Boeing is not only a weapons manufacturer but a gateway for engineering students to join. Should those students be disregarded as israel supporters? I have an Intel chip in my computer and so does everybody else on campus, and Intel is on the list of the companies UC should divest from. Are we all supporting Israel?",5,1716855129.0,t1_l5yczqa
1d1yy4o,l5yplvs,[deleted],"No problem! It was difficult finding numbers from an official source üòÖ

In terms of whether to divest, I think a nuanced approach would be best. One of the speakers mentioned the idea of not necessarily divesting but putting pressure on companies they invest in, like Boeing, for example, to have more ethical business practices. 

I also don't necessarily agree with every company in that list, like you mentioned a lot of companies support Israel, and I'm not sure whether all of them donate arms. I don't mind if a company like Disney, for example, donates humanitarian aid to Israel since that doesn't directly harm Palestinians.

However, for companies that do directly supply Israel with weapons, like Boeing, even if they also have other non-violent niches, I do think we should still divest. The UC system has divested from the fossil-fuel industry in the recent past ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAvXWlC9D88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAvXWlC9D88) ), and I'm sure those industries may have supplied jobs and other societal value besides just fossil fuels, but the UC system ultimately came to the conclusion that sustainability and preparing for climate change outweighed these benefits.

I do want to point out though that I don't think it's right to judge anyone.  I don't think anyone who works at Boeing, or your dad who files a Boeing aircraft, for example, is a bad person, or that they're supporting Israel, especially if they're not directly responsible for making weapons.

1dbdfe9,l7uei11,Dangerous-Anxiety321,"Hello! I transferred last year and I was really scared of the same thing. I did my community college stint during Covid and made zero friends there because it was online and I‚Äôm a very shy person- I was worried the same would happen at UCI. 

However it didn‚Äôt. In my experience, if you really want to make friends and you put the effort in, there are lots of people out there who want to be friends with you too. But you HAVE to put yourself out there and try. I learned this the hard way, my first year here as a transfer student I didn‚Äôt join any clubs because I felt like I should focus on studying, and I was too shy to ask people I chatted with in class to hang out after or exchange contact info. So I didn‚Äôt make super close friends (outside of my roommate) and I struggled a lot with loneliness. But this year I joined a couple clubs, and forced myself to just talk to people whether in class or in a club meeting, and I tried to go to as many meetings or events that I could. And it worked, I have made friends this year that I feel like I will be friends with forever. 

So my advice (I know others have already said this but here it is again) is first to join clubs. There‚Äôs tons of them out there so just find something that interests you! But also, there‚Äôs large social clubs like the anteater adventure club that has tons of fun events and of course the sororities and fraternities also, one of my good friends is a transfer student who joined a sorority and loves it. Or you can go for the smaller clubs that are more specialized and have fewer people in them so you can meet everyone and be part of a small group. Either way, join clubs!! 

The other thing would be to pay attention to your email because the transfer center hosts little events all the time and that‚Äôs a good way to meet other transfer students and talk. Same goes for your department, whenever there‚Äôs a departmental event going on it can be a really good way to get to know others in your field and it can also help with meeting professors. Joining a research group can also help you connect with others in your field. 

One last thing (sorry this got very long), another place where I found a community and made lots of friends was in my second language course. If you‚Äôre interested in going deeper in a language, you can take the second year after completing the first year, and in my experience the second year classes are very very small so you know everyone and you‚Äôre all struggling to learn a new language and the whole class can become like a big friend group! 

Anyway I hope any of that helps a bit, I know just how intimidating a new college campus filled with so many people can be. I wish you the best of luck and if you‚Äôd ever like to talk to someone, feel free to reach out :)",2,1717955213.0,t3_1dbdfe9

the area which we now call palestine and israel was ruled by the ottoman empire. it was a world power, not a weak state. if there is to be a discussion of settlement and colonialism of this area, you should at least start there. the ottomans weren't even arabs; they were turks. 

this world power sided with the germans during WW1 and lost. the armistice they signed with the allies divided up the empire. this wasn't an act of colonialism, it's a natural consequence of war. look at how germany was divided up among the victors after WWII. it's not a unique situation. the there were many arab factions that fought against the ottomans, and worked closely with the british. you could argue that the way it was divided was purposefully designed to create conflict, and was bad, but this is not the same thing as colonialism. the british were as usual, looking out for themselves, and not advancing some secret idealistic agenda. 

the main reason the USA entered the picture, is because of the cold war. the arab nations surrounding israel sided with the russians. israel is a natural ally, because they are a democratic state with relatively western values. remember that the US supported far more questionable regimes during this time, like chile and argentina, simply to counter russian influence. this support has continued after the end of the cold war, to counter states like iran. again, this is purely explainable by the US acting in what it views as it's best interests, and not advancing some secret agenda or grudge. this is also why you see other sunni arab states work with israel. it's pragmatic. 

to say that the creation of a national home for the jews after the horror of WWII is due to a ""manufactured"" movement is extremely disingenous. the sentiment i draw from your post that it was all some nefarious or secret plot, is a typical line of rhetoric used by antisemites. so, don't fall for it! the history of this area is extremely complicated, and nobody can lay claim to the moral high ground. what you posted was full of gross oversimplifications that serve only one viewpoint. you should at the very least look at what happened between 1948 and now to really even begin to understand.",10,1715372016.0,t1_l3eku2x

Could Israel have done more to prevent civilian deaths? Maybe. They are fighting an unconventional army that is embedded in the civilian population and is more than comfortable using civilian infrastructure such as hospitals for their military operations. You say Israel is ""committing literal genocide"" but what is happening in Gaza is war, not genocide. The Gaza Health Ministry (which is Hamas btw) death toll numbers are a little suspect, but let's go ahead and say they are accurate. 34,000 have been killed out of a population of about 2 million. About 14,000+ of those killed have been confirmed terrorists so now let's assume the civilian death toll is 20,000. Still tragically high, but to put it in perspective that is 1% of the population. Moreover, more Gazan civilians have been born since Jan. than have been killed. Then of course we have another 2.7m Palestinians in the West Bank. The population of Palestinains is not significantly shrinking. In the U.S-Iraq War of 2003, roughly 300,000 Iraqis died. also about 1% of Iraq's population. Moreover, the percentage of civilians killed was a much higher 67%. Was this a genocide of Iraqis? Over a quarter of those killed in Ukraine are civilians. Is this a genocide?

The IDF's indifferent toward killing civilians is not any less evil than Hamas terrorist killing someone's out of pure hatred. 

Your argument against genocide is really weak. Like it is not a genocide because only 1% percent of the population died? So what? If a genocide is occuring, are we supposed to wait until 90% of Gazan to die until we can call it a genocide? What is the threshold? So what happened to the Uyghur is not a genocide? Genocide can be both about displacing a population or purging their culture and not just killings. 

14,000 *aren't* being *confirmed* terrorists. That is just Israeli's estimate. Israeli knows exactl how many terrorists are killed, but they couldn't publish how nany civilians got caught up in their slaughter? Also according to the IDF about 700 civilians died during the Hamas terrorist attack and about 400 security personel died. The proportion is pretty similar, 20,000 to 14,000( israeli estimate )

The IDF has inflicted several order of magnitude of human suffering and carnage  greater than what Hamas did and yet people are still unable to condemn both as evil.

It is kind of a new development in human history that a war between two parties isn't genocide but most are. This is kind of a war for genocide for both. Israel want all of the Palestinians gone but can't really kill all of them because of PR while the Palestinians have no capacity to carry out their genocide.

It is kind of silly to think Israel is doing anything but promoting Hamas, even if all of the Hamas members got wiped out there is still going to be grivances. Save my comment. In the next 20 years, there will be another terrorist attack and it the cry will be something along the line of ""remember the 2024 Massacre of Gaza"".

I didn't need a car in Irvine during my time here (and i had work outside of school), it's ultimately a cost / benefit analysis for you. the parking + insurance cost of owning a car outweighed the occasional ubers for me when i needed to go somewhere not reachable by transit. I lived in PV last year and the parking was always full to the point where if you lived in PV you would need to park in ECPS consistently, so not all ACC parking is equal.

I've even made the trek out to UCLA via transit - again, I understand it's more convenient to have a car, but in 99% of cases it's not a necessity.

1flhgik,lo36h0j,giddyuppity,"All schools definitely have their own issues, even the supposed best ones. In that scenario, we are not unique in having issues, but what are issues are exactly are our own. You are not wrong to be upset about it, or frustrated, but it is incredibly difficult to hold this school accountable because we are still paying for it. They could revoke our admission or anything we have if they wanted to; that's the worst part. 

All you can and should do, in this scenario, is complain. Extensively. Complain a LOT. Make sure that whatever issue you have, you air out your concerns and you make it clear how frustrated you are. Make other students feel the same way. 

I have to say championing how much you want to leave is like you walking into a Starbucks saying ""You just lost a customer"". It's absolutely valid if it's related to FAFSA issues (such as affordability and cost of living), but I encourage others to be a bit smarter in how they choose to protest the university. Do things you can actually do, not things that are a stretch or unlikely to ever occur. The unfortunate scenario is we do not have the specific resources to hold UCI or any university for that matter, accountable. They have power over us, we are simply students.

So, do like what most can do: make sure you're upset. I encourage you, as many students are doing, to complain. And if that's what you have been doing, continue it.  At some point, just like how asking your parents ""are we there yet? are we there yet"" will make them yell how much longer you have until you get there, UCI will eventually get fed up.
