1fgs5hl,ln4d72q,limonadebeef,"wsj ranks based on job outcomes over prestige which is a nice change of pace. i honestly don't doubt UCM ranks high on that front bc of merced's proximity to major cities who need the computer science/engineering expertise (silicon valley) and the fact that the san joaquin valley hosts opportunities in the agricultural industry for people of all disciplines to participate in. in addition to its accessibility to low-income students, i really don't think this is as flawed as i've seen ppl make it out to be. although i'm very surprised it ranked higher than UCLA, i wonder what the job market has been like in los angeles to have ranked so low.",46,1726337927.0,t3_1fgs5hl
1fgs5hl,ln6ui8d,Aleventen,"The job market in Tech has generally taken a kick in the pants. 

Lots of the jobs in LA and SF were tech or tech adjacent and the 10s of thousands of layoffs in that sector over saturated the market.

Graduates are getting pushed out by folks with established careers fighting for the same positions and it's only really gotten worse with time. 

I wouldn't be surprised to hear that many of the students entering computer science/engineering or data or cyber (etc.) are either moving away, considering career pivots or pursuing grad school.

I, myself, graduated from Berkeley hoping for a job in tech, had an awesome resume and transcript - didn't matter, have to move to Oregon to get my foot in the science and tech door. 

It's an interesting time and more prestigious universities may find their graduates struggling more than less prestigious ones if more humble kids apply to less competitive positions in less saturated markets with a UC degree.",8,1726368735.0,t1_ln4d72q
1fgs5hl,ln6xy98,limonadebeef,"i know this all too well. i graduated from uc merced back in may with a CSE degree and this was all i was told after i graduated. i was very lucky to have landed a job back in july in california, albeit not in SF or LA but in sacramento. that being said berkeley still is the highest ranking UC on this list so i imagine at the very least if CS grads from berkeley are struggling, other berkeley grads from other majors have been having a somewhat easier time than the rest of the recent UC grads. so it still does seem kind of strange that UCLA has ranked so low, especially seeing as UCLA isn't known as a CS school like berkeley is (and UC merced is known for the natural sciences department which i imagine those graduates are what make up most who are more easily finding post-grad opportunities).",7,1726370254.0,t1_ln6ui8d
1fgs5hl,ln4c6bc,Practical-Database-6,I like Merced cause it’s chill. Not competitive for grades like other top UCs and you can find opportunities here.,27,1726337610.0,t3_1fgs5hl
1fgs5hl,ln4w222,best_person_ever,"WSJ has leaned heavily into social mobility in their rankings, which is a good thing since that's more representative of a positive post-grad outcome for most students. Since UCM takes in a lot of first gen and high financial need students, then they graduate with salaries comparable to other top colleges, it demonstrates that the university can win races even when starting in last place. 

That's what this ranking is really showing, which colleges are best at doing the most when they start with the least. That's not meant to be disrespectful to UCM students in any way. The reality is that the most prestigious institutions simply are not accessible to 97% of the population. There are several students at Berkeley and UCLA that were accepted at Harvard, but because their parents are middle class and they don't qualify for aid, attending is unaffordable. If I recall correctly, around 20% of Harvard students come from families in the top of 1% of income. They take in a few poor kids, but a large portion of their student body already have well paying jobs secured by birth. It's easy to win races when you start with a fleet of Ferraris. As a student, if you're not already a Ferrari then is that the best place for you to be? 

Even comparing to Berkeley and UCLA, they get a lot of the upper middle class-wealthy CA kids from top private schools that are well prepared for college. I'm not criticizing that because they make certain to take students from all over the state, but they're only taking the very top students. Conversely, UCM is taking really good students that simply haven't had the advantages that most of the kids at Stanford or USC have. This really stood out to me at orientation as you could tell that many of the parents and students were lost navigating the collegiate process. Family experience in this world makes a big difference and UCM seems pretty good at helping students overcome that. 

As you can tell, I'm a big fan of rankings that heavily weigh how well off students are 5-10 years after graduation versus how they were as freshmen. This is far more applicable to 90% of students than historical prestige or number of Nobel laureates on staff. As an undergrad, students aren't working with those well-renowned researchers anyhow. If the discussion shifts to more specialized graduate level studies, then my position would shift a little. 

To give a little more post grad perspective, I've hired dozens of engineers from a wide variety of schools, including most of the renowned engineering schools in CA (UCLA, USC, Berkeley, Cal Poly, Cal Tech) and others outside the state. I don't see a tremendous difference in the capability of new grads between these schools. Of significance, they all have the exact same starting salary, aside from a little variation tied to GPA. I'll also note that some of my best hires have come from the Cal States.

edit: My comments are pretty specific to white collar working class careers like engineering and may have little applicability to students pursuing a career in something like investment banking.",21,1726343828.0,t3_1fgs5hl
1fgs5hl,ln4f8cu,PugsandCheese,"Not sure how they precisely calculate social mobility but if it’s family income versus graduate income, then Merced being #1 is probably why we’re ranked so high. I did undergrad at Berkeley and at least 90% of my friends were rich rich, so not a lot of upward mobility possible.",18,1726338578.0,t3_1fgs5hl
1fgs5hl,ln5d64q,DnB925Art,"I'm a CAL grad (Go Bears!) but my son is currently a freshman at Merced. I was impressed by UCM with it's focus on giving students from backgrounds that many people would consider ""disadvantaged."" I saw many students where they are probably the first in their family to attend college, some that may be undocumented, some from low income families, some where a parent may be currently incarcerated and some that may have come from areas where the school systems are under performing. Plus as far as I know, it is one of the only UCs , if not the only UC, that has unlimited swipes for their meal plan so it gives every student a chance to focus on their studies and not have to worry about not being able to eat due to economic reasons. I think it gives a chance for a student to improve their economic and social standing despite whatever background they come from without sacrificing the quality a UC education can provide. Of course being a new campus, everything is practically brand new: the housing, classes and equipment. Also with less students and currently the smaller size of the campus, it feels more like a community college than a full blown UC, but with the smaller size, there are smaller class sizes where students get more care and attention from the faculty. I remember the days trying to meet with my professor during office hours was near impossible when your lectures had 800 students vs how easy my son can meet with his professor when his lectures are less than 100 students (he is a Computer Science and Engineer major).",11,1726349183.0,t3_1fgs5hl

This methodology hurts the rankings of prestigious colleges full of legacies.

On the other hand being a smaller colleges it does not teach as many upper division specialized courses as UCB does.

The alumni network is not as large or prestigious.

Also the friends you are going to make are going to be mostly 1st gen college so its not like their parents will fund your startup ( a real possibility at UCB or Stanford)

On the other hand unlike UCB you wont be fighting to get into your pre requisite courses. You have a much higher chance of graduating in 4 years from UCM than UCB as you will get your pre req courses when you need them.

This includes things like reputation of students in grad programs - how have the UCR kids done versus other schools alums. UCM is particularly good in biomedical sciences.

The structure will be a two- and three-level structure with a paseo between the Social Justice Quad and Ansel Adams Road. The COB III site is central to the four facilities that currently house SSHA faculty and academic programs, creating a hub for academic and student support services for the SSHA community. SSHA student advising, undergraduate and graduate student support services, and curriculum services will be housed in COB III. 

The project will also house two large lecture halls and an auditorium. The auditorium will seat 460 and will double as a public assembly and event venue, currently a critically lacking resource at UC Merced. There will additionally be a 290-seat circular lecture hall and a 250-seat casestyle lecture hall both designed to encourage engagement and flexibility in a large lecture hall setting.

1fuwsvc,lq2xrrw,why_not_my_email,"(I'm a UCM professor.  Faculty have pretty much nothing to do with undergrad admissions.) 

Yeah.  In January 2019, we were supposed to hit 10,000 students in the Fall.  We're now underenrolled by like 2,000-3,000 students, and as a consequence the campus budget is in pretty dire straits.  

There are a few factors contributing to the problem.  The year online in 2020-21 was one hit to enrollment.  Then, under pressure from the state legislature, the other UC campuses admitted more students overall and a higher share of in-state students.  Since we're usually not anyone's first choice, some students who would've gone here are now at Davis, Irvine, etc.  The FAFSA debacle was huge this year — I heard an estimate somewhere that we might have 500 more students if not for the FAFSA problems. 

In messaging to the faculty, the administration's big diagnosis has been that we don't have certain popular majors.  IIRC Electrical Engineering launched last Fall; this year there're the two Data Science majors; and we'll get Communications next year.  Econ did something with Accounting (like an emphasis track maybe?), and we'll get Neuroscience in I think Fall 2026.  

This year, I'm seeing more of an emphasis on admissions yield (getting admitted students to register) and retention (keeping students who would drop out, usually for academic reasons).  

Personally I'm really concerned about the physical isolation and lack of amenities on and near campus.  I got my PhD from a private university that's about the same size as UCM.  That school had two sit-down restaurants, both with bars; three independent counter-serve/fast causal places, one of which was open until like 1am on the weekends; a Subway; a Burger King; and at least two coffee stands.  Plus the two dining halls.  The Subway and Burger King were in the student union; in the basement of that building were a couple of pool tables — free for students to use — a small performance venue (one of three on campus), a very small bowling alley, a salon AND a barber shop, a branch of the local credit union (you used to have to go to the bank in person a lot), and a convenience store.  The closest grocery store (also the closest pharmacy) was about a mile from the north dorms.  Between campus and that store were six or eight more restaurants.  Across the street from campus to the south was a mixed-use development, with two or three bars and a handful of other restaurants beneath two floors of apartments.  Immediately after that development was a neighborhood of rental homes and apartment complexes that was very popular with grad students.  

I've been an academic for almost twenty years now, and I've seen lots of college campuses.  Ours is, by far, the worst designed for the students who actually live on it.  I worry that a lot of families show up for a tour, see how isolated UCM is, and move it to the bottom of their list.",34,1727924147.0,t3_1fuwsvc

UC Merced is pretty much in the middle of nowhere compared to many other schools. It’s definitely not the most desirable school due to a lack of certain programs that other schools have (I know a few people that went to Stan State/inter UC transfer because Merced didn’t have their program). 

If I went D1 in a sport it would be for “Pav Hating”. The Pav has been atrocious for a while. It has had some slight improvement in the last year or so, but I still wouldn’t eat there unless I really had to.

1ct5vk6,l49sha1,Kingyveltal,"Tips to save money at UC Merced: 

1. Student discounts: Merced is a college town, though that might sound obvious given that the university is literally called UC Merced. An extra benefit is that the town loves students, and a handful of places will give discounts for just having your UC Merced ID card. Places I’m aware of that implement discounts are: Raley’s supermarket( must use checkout lane as opposed to self check out, and ask for discount), Yogolicious frozen yogurt shop near Target, Merced grand buffet (Chinese food, ice cream included). Those places offer a 10% student discount

I have saved dozens of dollars at Raley’s over the years, the buffet is my goto spot for chow mein, one of the best places to go in town for the stuff-&gt; can’t go wrong with $13-15 for all you can eat and dessert. The yogurt place is my sweet treat spot, love going there once in a while… ever since Baskin Robbin’s got rid of their $4 soft serve 😅. 

There are more places downtown near the movie theater, including a few fast food joints, I however cannot recall which restaurants do have the discount. They are proudly owned by UC Merced alumni or have a sticker that says proud to serve students. 

Target has something called a Red Card, it is a student discount, but you gotta register online for it. 

2. Split bills: Divide grocery shopping by roommates, a bunch of Costco eggs split 6 ways saves a lot of money in the long run. Find people who are willing to take some of the financial burden off of you in return for a supply of groceries. 

3. Rewards programs: You are going to be in this town for a while, if you go to Quickly’s often enough, get a points card. Want to go to McDonald’s every other week? Sign up for the McDonald’s app. Basically sign up for any loyalty program you can find yourself actively engaging with, you’ll save a couple of bucks over the long run. 

4. Student store: go near the end of the semester near finals, they’ll have a finals discount. Also don’t buy school supplies there unless it’s an emergency, they have a noticeable markup. You’ll need a lab coat, safety goggles, and a carbon copy notebook (you write on one page, a copy is instantly made on the page underneath) for most STEM labs-&gt; it’ll set you back like $45 on campus, but you can go on Amazon and get that stuff for like $27 if you plan right. Speaking of, Amazon prime is free for students going to college",12,1715840701.0,t3_1ct5vk6
1ct5vk6,l49r2q5,Kingyveltal,"College cost/spending Part 2 

4th semester: sophomore $1511. Living in Merced Station is really nice if you have good roommates. I got the hang of knowing where I wanted to shop and what was around town: went to the Asian grocer downtown (Lee’s community market) to get 5 pounds of ready to cook Chow mein noodles every other week at this point. Took me a while to discover it, it’s a 30 minute bus ride on top of a 15 minute walk to get there if you don’t have a car. I started treating myself to takeout downtown for walking around down there so much. I recommend New China Cafe, very out of the way by foot, but one of the best Asian places in town. Literally walked miles just to get it when I went downtown. Anywho, spent $1500ish from takeout every week, maybe 2x a week, groceries, splitting costs of eggs and stuff with roommates. You can save a lot of money cooking for yourselves and coordinating groceries and money with roommates.

5th semester junior: $ 2014. I kept the same habits, but I did do a few more crazy spending here and there. Took a vacation to Sacramento on an AmTrak train from Merced to attend an event, spent $100+ on food and stuff there. Also, had a change in 4/5 of my roommates. We didn’t coordinate on when we bought things or splitting eggs, so that sorta hurt. 1. A lot less space in the fridge 2. There were like 3 cartons of eggs in the fridge and we didn’t always share with each other since we spent our own money on them. 3. Having to buy groceries full price with no one to split costs with kinda hurt. I think when I became a junior, I got this idea that I needed to treat myself more for surviving the week at school? So I got takeout more often and went out for ice cream once in a while. Also bought some stuff at Bath and Body works… stuff ain’t cheap. Also a nice lamp I saw at Target for $50ish bucks?

6th semester junior: $2056. Got access to a car after some paperwork and getting a driver’s license recently. Found that I splurged more on going outside to get stuff now. For example: Costco can help save money, but shopping at Costco ain’t cheap if you don’t eat stuff fast enough. For example: spent $30 on muffins this semester. 2 packs of 6 muffins costs $10 at Costco (they make you buy 2 packs here, can’t buy just 1, literally). I figured I could eat them during breakfast. Problem is I got sick of how rich the chocolate muffins were, and sometimes wasted them 😅. Try to have a roommate(s) or friend(s) help you at Costco, split some eggs, share a 3 pack of milk, it helps save a lot of money and produce. Be careful with Costco meat, it’s by no means bad, but will set you back like $30-50 every package. I’ve heard friends only recommend costco meat at college if you have EBT or Calfresh money to spend (living at an apartment at Merced Station can qualify you for Calfresh). What I spent on this 6th semester is more or less similar to my 4th, but being able to drive and buy stuff in bulk at Costco drove up some of my costs. I also spent $100 on souvenirs on a field trip to an aquarium, $200 on a paypal refill, and like $100 on some gift cards I saw were on sale at Costco… Also, don’t recommend late night classes, took a 6-7:15 PM class 2x a week, for surviving that I felt like I needed to spend money on ice cream every week to celebrate making it through the week. It’s a fun treat, but price can add up.",4,1715839731.0,t3_1ct5vk6

Cheap thrift store down Main Street that offers 
50% off on certain days 

Coffee Bandits has a lot of flyers with events + they’re a cute place to hang out 

Theres the billiards place downtown if you like pool 
Joystiq is cool 

There’s a roller skating rink 

There’s a cool record store 
The partisan has trivia night 

Mainzer has some plays you can watch. They also host trivia nights and other events like comedy shows.

If you drive down Bellevue, past the high school for a bit there’s a cool abandoned bridge by a river 

Lake Yosemite has kayaking and paddle boarding 
You can get a pool floaty or a raft and just lay out on the lake 

If you smoke you can hang out on stoners lane 

There’s the vernal pools you can explore 

Merced station has a pool and a cool hang out spot with games 

Campus hosts so many events, it’s just hard to stay informed but check out the office of student involvement, the transfer returning and veteran center, and the office of social justice initiatives. Those offices typically have the most entertaining events 

The pool on campus is free for students, just check the times they’re open online 

There’s a bus that takes you to Yosemite. Merced residents get a discount I believe and if u live on campus I think that counts. 

There’s really beautiful walking paths that take you by bear creek

There’s a hookah lounge 

There’s a few drag shows that pop up

It is a sweet small town and everywhere we went we met UCM students and bombarded them with questions. It is definitely a small town feel, but once you really analyze it she didn't feel like anything was really missing that she routinely ""needs"" other than big name concerts (They will NEVER be there, so gotta head to SF I guess if you are a concert goers like we are). If you need a real ""MALL"" it's about 40 minutes to Modesto to the Village Faire Shoppes and apparently students go there by car. (But you can't really have a parking permit if you are 1st year). All in all, the quiet town feel will still save most students 120k plus over 4 years in student loans for a UC education. This seems like a fair trade off and ""free tuition"" money isn't going to last forever as this campus grows...Some BOREDOM to save over 120k seems worth it, right? I mean how many boring hours would one work to pay that back. Lol. Forget that! And we aren't rich. We don't know any other UC schools so generous. Spoke to several families there. Friends are probably tighter here than most UC's. They depend on each other if that makes sense. I am sure the relationships if you make them will last forever. Absolutely worth it she thought.

From perplexity 

“””

The University of California, Merced (UC Merced) acquired land for its campus through a series of strategic purchases and partnerships, primarily aimed at supporting the university's establishment and growth in the Merced area. The process of acquiring land for UC Merced was part of a broader initiative to address the educational needs of the Central Valley in California, which was significantly underserved in terms of higher education facilities.

The initial acquisition of land for UC Merced began with the decision by the UC Board of Regents in 1988 to plan for a new campus in the San Joaquin Valley, recognizing the region's large and growing population without adequate access to higher education[5]. After a thorough site selection process, the Merced location was chosen in 1995 due to its potential to serve the educational needs of the region effectively[5].

In 2001, the university acquired significant parcels of land through a more than $11 million grant, which included the vernal pool landscape north and east of the planned campus. This acquisition was part of the environmental planning and conservation efforts associated with the development of the campus[14]. Additionally, in 2001, the University of California planned to acquire land from the Virginia Smith Trust, which would allocate 2,000 acres for the new UC Merced campus[12].

The largest land purchase by the University of California for one of its campuses was made for UC Merced, located next to Lake Yosemite just north of Merced. This strategic location supported the university's mission while also preserving significant areas of natural habitat and contributing to regional conservation efforts[16].

Overall, the acquisition of land for UC Merced was a carefully planned and executed strategy, involving multiple stakeholders and aimed at fostering educational development and environmental stewardship in the Central Valley of California.

Do you want to go to med/PA school? Then go to a community college first and ace your pre-requisites. Honestly, classes at community colleges are way easier than the UCs level. 

Do you want to be a software engineer? Then, UCM is a good choice. The reason why I said this is because if your goal is to go to a top engineering school, I’m not sure how much community college would prepare you for the first two years. This is not to say that engineering students at the community college aren’t as smart as the UC, but the academic rigor is very different. By the time students transfer, they feel behind with how difficult the UC classes are.

UC Regents Scholarship
All incoming students are automatically considered for a UC Regents’ Scholarship and need not submit any additional information or applications. The UC Merced Regents’ Scholarship program is unique to the UC Merced campus and recipients cannot transfer their award to other universities.

Selection Process
The selection process may take into account each student’s academic performance, quality of essays submitted on the application for admission, the quality of the student’s extra-curricular activities, letters of recommendation, personal achievement rankings, life’s hardships and additional distinctive personal achievements. All entering students are automatically considered for the UC Regents’ Scholarship. Students do not need to apply separately for this scholarship.

Monetary Award and Tenure of Scholarship
Entering freshmen are awarded a four-year scholarship (eight academic semesters); Entering transfer students are awarded a two-year scholarship (four academic semesters). There are no extensions of the scholarship.

All Regents' Scholars are considered for a $7,000 honorarium regardless of financial need.

If a Regents' Scholar has additional financial need beyond the $7,000 honorarium, the scholar will be awarded the maximum amount of university scholarships and/or grants to cover the remainder of the scholar’s in-state need. (Cost of Attendance minus Expected Family Contribution minus other financial aid equals need)

The Regents' Scholarship need-based award is determined annually and is designed to supplement all federal and state awards as well as other outside scholarship awards. Regents’ scholars are required to report additional outside financial assistance and/or outside scholarship awards to the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office so that awards can be adjusted appropriately.",3,1716698921.0,t3_1d03awc

1h6p357,m0f4gdg,retrnIwil2OldBrazil,"Supp bro so I was basically in the same situation in 2021 and now I’m a drop out but I’ve found some success in the job I’m working in. To be successful in school, you’ve got to have good mental health because the demands of academia will put enough of a strain on you by themselves. My suggestion would be to talk to a therapist and forget school until you feel like you’re ready. Good things come to you when you keep your thoughts positive and your actions/words mindful. It mental health is bringing you down, all you’ve got to is address that and you’ll be ready to dive back in

Also, try not to look at yourself so negatively. If someone looked at my transcript/grades, they’d figure I’m probably a dumbass. But in fact, even though I didn’t pass all my classes I learned a lot of  really useful stuff which has helped me out greatly in the work I do now.

I found that establishing connections with people in your field (professors, TAs, and even classmates) rly helps :0 who knows if there’s an opportunity that they can recommend you for yk? but another thing I’d suggest is taking an educational leave just to collect yourself and figure out what steps you want to take next.

1h6p357,m0hpcv8,Ok-Neck8925,"Hi, I’ve been in a very similar situation, if not worse, and I want you to know there’s hope! In my first three semesters at UC Merced, I failed multiple (damn near all) classes, was on academic probation twice, and even got a dismissal letter. My GPA dropped to like a 1.8, and I lost my financial aid.

That letter was my wakeup call. I appealed, locked in, and turned things around. I got all A’s the next semester, but my GPA was still under the threshold, so I had to appeal AGAIN. They accepted it because I showed improvement. Now, I’m a senior graduating in May 2025 ON TIME, within four years with a 3.5ish GPA, and I’m applying to law school.

Please don’t give up. Focus on improving step by step and show progress. Reach out to professors or advisors they can be understanding. Anything is possible if you put your mind to it. If I can do it, I promise so can you! Good willing praying for ya🤲🏼",3,1733373495.0,t3_1h6p357

Next semester start forming relationships w professors (go to office hours and literally just ask them abt their academic journey and why they chose ESS professors love to yap) then see if you can take them again in the Fall. Once you’re in the fall semester apply for the UROC program. (You need a 3.0 minimum but in a year you will be doing better) It’s a summer internship thing and it’s amazing!

What I would say is add a second major that is a GPA booster, like psychology. This will bring your GPA up in the long run, which will allow you to qualify for most grad programs. 

UCM has so many resources. Did I use most of them at first? No, but it is never too late to start. Address your mental health issues, go on meds if needed and do not allow yourself to rot.

1h6p357,m0ks776,Suspicious-Jello61,"It’s kinda funny, I am a CC transfer with an AS degrees when I transferred here I was like WTF the professor can’t teach and even after I get a BS degree I will still feel the same a BS degree would not matter in this era and the class fill up quick. I am pretty sure there are more student then the max number allowed for each class like 30 for upper div. Not to be rude but you are trying right lol, ofc. Personally, if it was an option to drop out or to cheat on an exam with chatGPT and get kick out. Some would say it would be a better option to just cheat and get kick out with ChatGPT if you don’t care anymore and you have a higher chance of leaving anyways. Even with a GPA with a 2.5 I think you can still apply for UROC. And there are ways around getting a letter of recommendation from your teacher. It not even guaranteed that if you were to talk to the teacher that he will sign a letter of recommendation. Apply anyways and just don’t care if you don’t get in or not. Fortune Favors the Bold and sitting around does not do anything. Depend some jobs for example being an officer in the military does not really matter what grade you have just that you graduated. The lowest GPA that I ever got was 0.95 and since I corrected it in the end of the Spring semester it was fine. But looking back I should have just cheated and save me the time of trying to get my grade back up as I took a lot of unnecessary class as I have a hard major. Just don’t get depressed and like jump somewhere jk. But been there rip. And in a way if you don’t standout and like you are invisible then people won’t realized thing for example if you were to decide to not drop out and take the ladder or whatever.",1,1733423067.0,t3_1h6p357
1h6p357,m0ry6t4,nuzohu,"Don’t lose hope, if this is your third semester then you’re still only a sophomore? You have so much time to raise your GPA and even if you don’t it’s not the end of the world. I graduated with a less than 3.0 GPA and I got a job after college at a plant biology lab at a prestigious institute in Southern California. I also just applied to Graduate school for environmental data science programs and many of these programs give you the opportunity to explain your circumstances if you received less than a 3.0 
Also as for the relationships with professors, I didn’t either until my very last semester and they were all more than happy to write me letters of recommendation and they’ve helped me when getting my job and now they’ve helped me as my references for grad school.
Point is, there are a bunch of ways to succeed in this field if you can find the drive and passion for it.

Look my honest advice to to focus on few units and get a better GPA. Long term that's the best advice I can give you. 

You might care about getting a degree in three years but it's a red flag for grad programs. Work really hard on your intro classes and that'll make labs more willing to take you on next year. When I was looking at RA's a HUGE red flag was someone who had taken a bunch of units early on. It shows you're in a rush when your goal should be to work on yourself and really perfect your soft skills. A lab doesn't want to take you on if you can't put in the hours to really learn how to distill or work a roto flask. 

Slow down, please just pump the breaks. One of the advantages of going to UCM is that you can get into labs and do research. But pushing through with a bunch of classes isn't the way. It's better the get good grades and a good RA experience then it is to power through the BS degree.",1,1721375382.0,t3_1e5xd0w

1gbzrj4,ltqkw0x,ChampionSwimmer2834,"In my very honest opinion, despite the location of the university, it IS what you make out of it. While I am not familiar with the econ program, I will say things such as internships and research opportunities have come to me (and many other students) very easily, and I can't say I would've had similar opportunities offered to me at a larger UC with more competition. There are lots of professional co-ed fraternities for most majors (including business/econ). If thats not an interest for you daughter, there are also non-greek life professional societies also run by students, that are equally if not more engaging.

In terms of the social scene which I'm sure your daughter might be more concerned with at the moment, it is a matter of how outgoing/willing you are to make friends, make plans, be involved, etc. I know people who feel lonely here and blame the location for it. And while that is a factor, it is not the defining factor. If a student does nothing outside of classes, isolates themselves in their dorm, no effort to make friends with their neighbors, or doesn't have interest to join clubs, then YES your experience will be dull (this can happen at any school, even the so called ""party"" schools). Despite this though, owning a car is very helpful because the campus is a few miles away from town (if they ever plan to live off campus).

Pros: Small campus--&gt; great opportunities that are very reachable to any student (internships, research, leadership opportunities, student orgs/clubs, etc) due to less competition (I heard big schools have applications/interviews for certain clubs with a very small acceptance rate, big shocker for me when I found out). Brand new facilities (classroom buildings and dorms). Easier to get registered for classes compared to bigger schools. Tuition is generally very cheap (may vary on the student's fafsa). Classes are academically rigorous just like any other school, misinformed people may tell you that Merced isn't prestigious, which is a lie... we are ranked above UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside. The academics are no joke especially for a new school. Classes are also generally smaller, which makes it easier to get 1 on 1 professor office hours. If they plan to live off campus, parking isn't as bad as other schools I've heard about. Also traffic around this area is generally small, so its easy to get across the city in no more than 15-20 minutes. Yosemite is an easy 1.5 hour drive.

Undeniable Cons: Away from town, bus system gives a 2-3 hour round trip between the UC and City of Merced. Very rural (depending on how you perceive it). Food dining does not have good history of being healthy (though it has gotten better as I've heard) and the options are limited (only two main dining halls, one barista shop, and three student stores). The weather is odd, either very cold, windy, and rainy during winter, or very hot and dry during the summer (100+ degree days).

I have friends who started off in community college and transferred to other UCs, where they are barely getting by at their new schools because of little financial aid assistance. In hindsight, I could’ve still racked up thousands in tuition debt even by going the “cheaper” route to community college, because 4 year universities are still very expensive. Thankfully I will never have to worry about tuition debt thanks to Merced. I will say in full disclaimer that the financial aid awarded depends on the individual student’s fafsa, but Merced does offer lots of grant money, a lot more than other schools. 

I hope this helps your daughter get more insight, and honestly if you any more questions always feel free to dm me!",1,1730048250.0,t1_ltw088k
1gbzrj4,ltq3izo,TheRockstarVon,"This is my perspective as a first time freshman who just graduated this June: it’s a great school and a great community, but your daughter is kinda right about it being in the middle of nowhere. I’m very used to a more rural area and it’s definitely something that might be quite different if you live in a packed city. the experience of living on campus is great though, you don’t feel like you’re in the middle of nowhere when you’re surrounded by so many people and so many things to do on campus. The only real con of this school is that it’s 15-20 minutes away from any sort of stores or restaurants in Merced since it’s out of the way, but besides that, it’s great. The meal plans are decent, everybody’s nice, you’re a 20 minute walk from a very pretty lake, and it’s a well designed modern school with ac(quite a few of these old schools actually don’t have ac in dorms or classrooms)",7,1729880772.0,t3_1gbzrj4

Essentially the Block Party is a campus initiated social event at the beginning of the year for students (mainly freshman) to attend and socialize. You basically just meet people and participate in the advertised activity.

On your desired major, the Cognitive Science major at UCM is a robust undergraduate degree that will prepare you for the same career and/or grad school opportunities as a Cognitive Neuroscience major at another UC would. When it comes to selecting upper division courses for your degree plan, you can choose courses and work with professors who emphasize neurobiology in their research.

More detailed information on the CogSci degree plan can be found here:  [https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=23&amp;poid=2910](https://catalog.ucmerced.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=23&amp;poid=2910)",2,1717334505.0,t3_1d28uin

1ckezug,l2n0ea2,SignumFunction,"[teacher here] My simple advice is to take it easy.  

Your first semester at UC Merced may have a schedule that feels generic, such as

* CSE 005 (intro to computing)
* Math 005 (pre-caluclus)
* Spark (freshman seminar)
* Writing 001

but this is common among incoming students. Be okay with the relatively easy course load at the start.  Like you said, you will want to set study habits and maintain your health. Set small goals, such as

* Finish most homework assignments at least one day before they are due. Many students who struggle at UC Merced procrastinate a lot and don't even start studying for exams until the day before (sometimes for reasons beyond their control)
* Make one friend in each class (leads to study groups later)
* Spend at least 3 hours per week in the library

If you achieve goals like these, then you can push yourself to become even more studious in subsequent semesters.",12,1714878542.0,t3_1ckezug

1ch810p,l20vh7s,helloyou92,"Hi there! First, I suggest you contact the Students First Center directly. They’ll explain your letter to you in detail and give you options. They’re also super knowledgeable and enjoy helping students like you navigate the enrollment process. If you get nowhere there, you can escalate and ask to speak directly with a financial aid advisor. They’re open during normal business hours and have virtual office hours after hours too over zoom, at least the last time I checked.

I’d also check their website because they explain a lot of this info in detail.

Anyway, here’s a breakdown:

Your Total Direct Costs are what you’ll actually be billed for by UC Merced. This includes tuition/fees, on campus housing/food if you’re living on campus, and health insurance unless you have your own and waive out of the mandatory student health insurance. Gift Aid is free money (grants and scholarships). Self help aid includes student loans, parent loans, and work study. You don’t have to take out the loans at all and can choose not to obtain a work study job. 

Now, this whole cost estimator is like an equation:

Estimated Direct Costs-Gift Aid= Net Costs

Net costs are the costs you’ll have to pay to UCM after your free money is applied to your account. For you, this is $4,948. You can choose to either pay this directly in cash (½ each semester) or use self help aid to help cover this cost. 

If you choose to use all of the self-help aid you’re eligible for ($11,900), you’ll have enough to cover your bill plus an additional $6952 to cover other stuff like books, supplies, personal care, and transportation. Again, you decide how much (if any) you’ll use of your self help aid to cover these costs. Some students use just enough to cover the bill and either apply for other scholarships, get family help, or obtain a job to help fund living expenses.

Hope this info helps!",10,1714523889.0,t3_1ch810p

These are only available to citizens and legal residents. For AB 540 students who fill the CADAA ,California has a corresponding program where the loan is guaranteed by California instead of US.

After this 6500, your parents are expected to take out loans . But if your parents credit history is not good enough to get loans you can fill an appeal form with the SFC and they will let you take out 6500 in unsubsidized loans for a total of 9500 in loans.

The 11900 probably includes 5400 in work study so they are expecting you to take 6500 in loans.

If you dont take loans but do the work study you will be left with 450 in cash.



Generally your 32K in gigt aid is made up as follows - 13K in calgrant, 8K in Pell grant if you are eligible, 2500 in grant to cover health insurance (you get this if you are using the college insurance and not some other insurance) and the rest is Bobcat grant. 

They try to cover you completely so with loans and work study you can cover all the costs.

If you are not eligible for Pell you may still get the Middle Class scholarship but you would have some cash you would need to pay.

The basic difference between UCs and CSUs is that UCs are research universities.  Faculty here are hired and promoted based more on our research portfolios than our teaching; it's the opposite as CSUs.  What this means for undergrads is that, if you just want to take classes, finish your education, and move on to your career ASAP, a CSU will generally have stronger teachers than a UC.  But if you want to get involved in research, are maybe thinking about grad school, a UC gives you the opportunity to get involved in research, in a way that CSUs generally can't provide.  

But!  At most UCs, research opportunities for undergrads are pretty competitive.  At UCM, we have fewer graduate programs, and what programs we do have are generally smaller.  So it's much easier here for undergrads to get involved in research here, and we actually have the highest rate of undergrad research in the entire UC system.

And I was able to check out their campus, which seems to be a nice, cozy, and well sought out school. From what I'm told, CSULB is considered to be close in resemblance to that of a UC. 

They are though, two different universities. One being in a large urban city while the other in a small, yet wide, town/city. (Merced is expanding, and so is the university). And Merced is a more research oriented university. 

I think it really depends on financial aid and the type of life style you want, and more than anything what you want to pursue in your career. 

Academic wise; Mechanical engineers learn the same things in any bachelor's program. The difference is the opportunities and connections your university has to offer in your respective field. But it also depends how much effort you are willing to put to get those opportunities. That's what makes you stand out in your first job. Not your academics but what you did with them. 

Consider what type of field you would like to get into and what internships might be locally available. Aerospace? CSLB could be a good choice because it's near a vast amount of aerospace companies. Are you interested in agriculture or structural/architectural? There are various opportunities near Merced. Look at what types of research programs each university has. 

I went with UCM because I wanted to focus my studies in UAVs/drones and that's something UCM is very good at. And I was able to fly them as much as I could lol",7,1718848444.0,t3_1djqeyk
1djqeyk,l9dh57d,DrBurnettInThe209,"In the abstract:  It's always good to keep in mind the ""prestige economy"" of higher education. Sometimes undergrads don't really grasp or appreciate the difference between a research university and a state college aimed at broader vocational education, or they see no practical difference in outcomes if both systems offer ""the same"" major -- but it's never the same.  It's important to remember that UC campuses and CSU campuses represent two different tiers of the three tiered system of public higher education in California, with more competitive admissions requirements for UC than for CSU (this is the corollary to having more research-focused tenured faculty at UCs than at CSUs).  UC schools are harder to get into than CSU schools -- a graduate of any branch campus of the University of California has a more prestigious resume (all other things being equal) than a graduate of any branch campus of CSU.

Concretely:  The size of the student body at UCM is very small compared to other schools in the UC system, never mind a massive state college like CSULB.  UC Merced is closer to a ""small liberal arts college"" in terms of its size.  This means smaller class sizes sooner in your education, more opportunities to work one on one or in small groups with leading scholars doing cutting-edge research in their fields, more assistance and support with every aspect of ""how to college,"" and more opportunities to get to know your fellow students. 

Specifically in your case:  as an engineering major in a program that is rapidly building its faculty and introducing new specializations for undergraduate study (specializations that track with both student demand and faculty expertise), you would be in a really good position to benefit from the massive infusion of resources that UCM's engineering school is going to be enjoying over the next several years.  As the reputation / resources / alumni network of the school of engineering grows, you will continue to reap benefits long after you have graduated.

tl;dr:  all other things being equal (and they rarely are, but for hypothetical purposes pretend they are), students should generally opt for attending the most prestigious university to which they have been admitted and which they can afford after all possible financial aid has been taken into account.  But in the specific case of UCM v. CSULB, you are more likely to get individualized attention / mentoring in your major -- from the advising process all the way through upper division courses, internships, and research opportunities -- than you would at a campus with many thousands more students.",4,1718834367.0,t3_1djqeyk
1djqeyk,l9cuc1j,SignumFunction,"Long story short, I have spent time at both universities.

While CSULB has more restaurants and a bar in the middle of campus, walking 30 minutes to the next closest shopping areas are not convenient.  Driving is especially tough.  The freeway on-ramps to the north and to the east, along with the traffic circle to the west , are rough at the end of a school day.

CSULB has a lot more people, and it is easier to make friends and form study groups there.

Picking UCM aims at a calmer time, as you would not have to worry as much about commuter traffic or parking each day. UC Merced also has much newer facilities and classrooms, along with faculty to believe in staying up to date in what they teach.

First, no one is bad at math. Many people have had bad experiences and then are told ""you're bad at math"" and that turns into a self-fulfilling curse. 


If you don't particularly like math, that's okay. But do take statistics. Everyone should take stats. It is vastly more important and useful than calculus. 


Second, taking a little time to explore lots of different classes is a good thing. If you're just out of high school, you've never had a chance to take philosophy, sociology, or CRES. Even things like history, literature, and math work completely differently at the college level. 


Specifically, take both intro to psych and intro to sociology. Which class do you find more interesting? Talk to some majors in both. What do they learn in more advanced classes? Go to the professor's office hours and ask about their research and advanced classes. (Seriously, office hours are always deserted.

Sociology is the study of society as a whole, why feminism exists, the black lives matter movement, the pink tax, redlining, etc. 

All of all these are both interesting classes, in my opinion.

But if there's is anything I could tell you as a 3rd year, come into school UNDECLARED and as the professor said, take all sorts of classes. 

If you're anything like me, who thinks a lot, you should try out a philosophy class, it'll challenge the way you think and change the way you see things.

Oh, and like others say, you're gonna take a math class or two, but you could always ask for help from the TA's and the professor. Don't be afraid to ask for help, but I know sometimes it's a little easier said than done.

I’ll be a PhD student at Merced in the fall but I did my undergraduate at Davis. To be honest, I loved my time at Davis BUT the class sizes are no joke. I think in comparison to the almost small liberal arts feel of UCM, UCD very much gives the vibe of large public research school. You will certainly receive a great education at either institutions but it’s more up to you on how you feel and what kind of a campus you want. Regarding the prestige thing, it’s super overrated. As an anecdote, when I was choosing between colleges as a freshman admit, I had a similar dilemma as you but for UCD and UCLA. I went with Davis because I knew I’d be happier there knowing I would receive the same quality education for less stress. As a prelaw student, I strongly encourage you to go to the school that’ll maximize your GPA and the amount of time you have to study for and ace the LSAT. Also, some of the smartest grad students I’ve ever met came from schools most have never heard of. I’ve also met people from great schools where I wonder how they even graduated kindergarten.

1frsm7e,lpfmhuz,[deleted],"1. TAG Program Eligibility: You’re right that the TAG (Transfer Admission Guarantee) program requires attendance at a California CC. However, many California CCs offer **fully online courses** now, especially in general education subjects. It’s worth checking out colleges like Foothill College, De Anza College, or Coastline College. These schools often have robust online programs that might cover what you need, even while you’re stationed in Louisiana. If you’re able to take enough units online through a California CC, you might still be eligible for TAG, even while being out of state.

2. Balancing Online and In-Person: For science classes with lab components that need in-person attendance, see if you can plan around your military leave or any trips back home to California. Some schools might allow you to complete the lab portion during a concentrated period (e.g., summer sessions or intensive weekend labs). Also, if you are stationed in Louisiana, you can take those in-person lab courses at a local Louisiana community college and transfer the credits to a California CC, as long as they’re accepted.

3. Plan B with CSUs (SJSU): Your fallback plan of applying to SJSU or other CSUs is smart. CSU campuses typically have more flexibility than UCs when it comes to accepting transfer students from out of state CCs. So, if the UC route doesn’t work out, you still have a great shot at getting into a CSU. Just keep in mind that CSUs have their own articulation agreements with CCs, so double-check which classes will transfer.

4. Maximizing Air Force Education Benefits: Since you’re already in the Air Force, take full advantage of the **Community College of the Air Force (CCAF)**. This can knock out a lot of your general education and elective units. Many Air Force personnel use their CCAF degree to leverage better transfer pathways into civilian colleges.

5. Planning Your Timeline: You mentioned targeting Spring 2025 to start at a California CC and then returning home in mid-2027. Keep this timeline in mind to make sure you’re hitting the unit and residency requirements for transferring to a UC or CSU. TAG programs typically have specific deadlines, so make sure you’re tracking that as well.

6. Get Guidance from Veterans’ Services: Both UCs and CSUs have veterans’ resource centers. Once you’re ready to apply, I highly recommend reaching out to them. They can help with navigating the process, using your GI Bill benefits, and even advocating for your unique situation.",7,1727576272.0,t3_1frsm7e

Merced's ESS predominantely focuses on conservation, sustainability, resource management and the effect of these on our ecosystems. There is a far smaller focus on large scale atmospheric sciences/meteorology. If those are your desired tracks you're better suited to gaining experience at another UC which has more faculty in those specific areas. 

Atmospheric science focus a great deal more on the potential effects and patterns in the climate due to interactions with the earths own magnetosphere and other large scale phenomena, which is not the focus or strength of UC Merced's ESS department. As stated, it's more a conservation focused program.

Regarding courses, my suggestion is to use your current zip code here: https://www.transferology.com/ and try to find courses at the local CC's that will meet the requisite transfer requirements to UC Merced. (This is if you don't want to do online education via a california cc.)

I won’t sugarcoat—the classes are very math-heavy. Personally, my thorn was calculus (which I retook). If you study and attend office hours, most professors are willing to spend time to help you grasp the material—at least enough to pass! UCM also has a free tutoring center as well, I believe! I say go for it. Good luck!",8,1714315791.0,t3_1cf0bkx

I personally don’t think it is super math heavy. There is some basic algebra and the highest math level you will go to is calc 1. It isn’t too difficult and all the work is very doable.

1. How is the program overall at UCM? Is it a great experience? And are the professors interested in bonding with their students?
2. Have you gotten any internships from studying in this program? Or any outside job opportunities?
3. What devices are recommended for this program? Any laptops or computers fit for this?

Besides that the courses that are math/calculus heavy are Econ 100 and Econ 101. No going around those just lock in. There are other math heavy courses like Econ 110 and Econ 163 and 105 but they're more manageable and the latter 2 are less calculus and more Algebra and simple calculations. 

Graduating senior in MBE btw.

Edit: I only got Algebra 1 in HS then completed up to calc 2 at a local community College in the bay.

The heavy courses tend to have TAs who hold regular office hours on top of the professors hours. So they're pretty helpful just put in the time on your end.",3,1714459088.0,t3_1cf0bkx

There is also Micro-internships available on ParkerDewey.com, which are easy little side gigs which you can get paid for (usually $300-$600 a gig) and can help build up your resume.

Once your resume is more fleshed out, and you've also made some connections with the UC faculty or other people in the industry, then you might have some more luck while applying for bigger internships in the future.

Slightly longer version: There have been multiple attempts to establish the GS, since at this point (growing with interest for like 20 years) the gift is like $20 million or something.  The most recent proposal was based on the departments of Economics, Cognitive Science, Political Science, and Management of Complex Systems, all of which currently exist.  It would have taken something like 1/3 to 1/2 of SSHA's administrative staff.  The whole campus is understaffed, but SSHA especially so, and so SSHA faculty did not like this plan.  There were also questions about how these four departments were supposed to fit together into a coherent unit that was very distinct from the rest of SSHA. This version of GS was not intended to be a traditional business or management school, and AFAIK there was no discussion of creating a second business major or a MBA program.  

I believe the current plan is to work towards spinning the Econ department alone out into a fairly traditional business school.  The Econ faculty are working on creating a second business major and an accounting major, and maybe also some kind of graduate business program.  The new programs might launch in Fall 2026, and at that point someone might share a new proposal for the GS.",13,1731902151.0,t3_1gtvll5

1gtvk1s,lxpi4r6,SkywardStar,"Just coming from a student perspective, I think that it would be really nice to have those schools but it’s quite too early to tell. One of UC Merceds founding principles was to bring more education to the Central Valley, and the medical education school is in turn part of that, meant to bridge the healthcare gap that is also prevalent in the Central Valley, which is why I think there’s such a focus on it right now. 

Relatively speaking, Merced is still in a very young stage of a universities life, as it’s turning 20 years old next year. Law Schools for example come much later after a University’s founding, such as UC Irvines school of law that came around in 2007 when UCI was founded in 1965.

We’re only just now finishing about stage one of the Long Range Development Plan that came out in 2009. For now I believe that the university is focusing on developing its student population since, as we know if we continue to miss our enrollment goals, we won’t be able to develop the university at all.",10,1731904008.0,t3_1gtvk1s

Not the students success center, an actual transfer counselor that has the ability to look in the system. Make them look for your application and show them the confirmation from UC Apply.

I recommend you'd actually bring less since you can buy whatever you need as you go along the year.

His lectures weren’t very helpful as most of us felt he rushed through slides a lot, he’d also make 600+ slide presentations that wouldn’t load on my pc, so it wasn’t like I could just go back and catch up. His quizzes were also on concepts that he’d barely introduce in lecture that same week. Lots of people protested against his teaching methods and his response was always stubborn &amp; condescending. Main reason people didn’t fail his class including me was because his grade &amp; test curves were very forgiving.

His lectures sometimes explain concepts well like gausses law and other major equations but most of it is a kind of pointless. He does derivations of equations and conceptual problems like electric field of an infinite plain and I felt it was kind of pointless but enjoyed learning it. His tests are sometimes hard because he enjoys to put paragraph long questions for frqs and saqs. Him as a person is very mixed too because he is condescending when answering questions. The homework for the course is also hard if you don’t practice concepts and take a good while to complete. Labs are light and can be completed in a a few hours. Honestly if I were in your position I would try to get a better professor for the course because electricity and magnetism is just more harder to grasp than mechanics and deals with vector calculus.

WRI 010 or 001: important to take because of ucm's entry level writing requirement. depends on how you did on your writing placement test.

Both of them also have diligent student workers who can help you out with coursework. WRI and SPRK are very manageable (SPRK is very easy, similar to CSE005). I think these four classes are the best combo for your first semester. I wouldn't worry about Spring just yet, you'll be able to meet with your academic advisor in the fall and they'll be able to guide you through it. I'd recommend Econ6A or Econ10 along with Math011.

-Get second hand books or even better free pdfs

-apply for scholarships and more grants

Dorming is expensive but convenient, not gonna straight up list numbers (largely because I forgot them) but dorming on campus is roughly as expensive as tuition itself. 

Personally lived in a 4 person room at Glacier Point dorm my first year. Had a fun time, but still cost a pretty penny 😅. The advantage is you can run to class in 10 minutes or less, and require less than 30 minutes from waking up,to getting ready for class, to actually being in class. Furthermore, a meal plan is mandatory for dorming students, costs $2000 for either the year or semester? Either way not cheap. 


Merced Station is my personal pick(biased because I live there). Apartments are brand new, comes fully furnished with a fridge, stove, tv, couch, chairs, beds, laundry etc. and it’s roughly the same price as dorming on campus ( or it was, they’ve changed the prices and I’m currently unaware as to if it’s still cheaper or not). Apartment is way bigger though, currently live in a room 2x as big as when I lived with 3 other people on campus, but I pay roughly the same amount of money and it’s all for myself. 

You need more independent living skills like cooking, cleaning, and shopping compared to dorming on campus, but it is cheaper and in my opinion much nicer looking. 

Downsides include, you have to sign a lease for the year, so you still pay for the apartment in June, July when you’re not living there in the summer (assuming you go home). There are a few valid complaints such as commonplace cleanliness (don’t clean spiderwebs/dead bugs in shared spaces that often), also there was an incidence of bicycle thefts in the locked bike storage areas across the building during Thanksgiving (now we have security cameras pointed at the door). 

I still think the positives outweigh the negative, comes with a pool, gym, and a game room. Also there is a shuttle that takes students to UC Merced campus every 15 minutes give or take from 6 AM to 10PM (minus 2 30 minute breaks) 


Renting a house or another apartment is the cheapest option. I’ve heard/seen reports of $600 rent per month or less from some people living with roommates off campus. You’ll likely need your own furniture, insurance, but it’s a pretty good deal otherwise. Transportation can definitely be an issue, there are buses that head to campus all across town where students live and commute… but they can take 10-50 minutes depending on where you live (bus cycles back every 55 minutes or so on weekdays).

1cil7y4,l2cb6k5,HenriHawk_,"no clue, never used them. i got nebo because it seems like it was the only half-decent handwritten note-taking software that supported windows (it also supports apple devices and androids iirc). i switched away from it because i was annoyed with onenote for windows 10 (not to be confused with onenote) and i liked onenote for windows 10 more than normal onenote, but onenote for w10 is being discontinued/unsupported in the future. i believe nebo is relatively new, but has had enough time for its kinks to be worked out.

heres my opinion with nebo for msft surface:

pros:
- drawing is smooth and clean. it handles pen input well
- automatic shape recognition feels well implemented and not forceful but not annoying to use. i hold the pen down at the end of the stroke if i want it to turn into a shape
- great handwriting text recognition
- shape and line snapping, and how shapes and lines smap to oneanother
- works nicely with my surface slim pen 2, including the side button
- myscript (the developer) regularly adds new features that i actually wanted and use regularly. an example of this is how when using shape recognition for lines, it detects if its a horizontal or vertical line and snaps it appropriately.
- no subscriptions required
- has both infinite whiteboard and individual page layouts
- handles the lasso tool much better than microsoft onenote

cons:
- cost (i got it for ~$10 on the microsoft store if memory serves, but because of how much i use it, i can say its well worth it)
- pallette buttons at the top of the screen feel poorly laid out. they're small and the undo/redo buttons are on the wrong side of the screen. it feels like it takes up too much screen real estate. however, i can scratch out drawings/strokes to delete them, i can also use the back of my stylus as an eraser. the undo and redo buttons are also still easily accessible just not very ergonomic if you're right-handed like i am. i feel like they should be on the left of the screen so i can use them with my free hand.
- very very minor, but it doesn't utilize the surface slim pen 2's haptics. i might actually like it more like this to be honest.
- no math recognition on infinite whiteboard files
- sometimes buggy, but generally less so than onenote for windows 10",1,1714703449.0,t1_l2c8y68
1cil7y4,l2cqp4e,CoffeeVector,"Dang this very detailed review is completely wasted on me 😅. I didn't have a tablet or tablet-like device; just an ordinary laptop.

1cil7y4,l2cr397,HenriHawk_,"ah gotcha lol

i have friends who use LaTeX, but i look at their notes and think to myself ""damn, it doesn't look anywhere near as clean, but i cant imagine not using freehand written notes""

for me, typing text instead of writing, especially for math with complex equations, seems like it would be tedious, especially considering I am already a slow note taker haha

probably just a matter of practice though

Alternatively loading up evening/mornings so you can work part time morning/evening. 

Keep in mind classes with labs take much more time so dont take more than 2 lab courses a sem.

Also if you are planning to transfer also look at what courses you need for your target transfer courses. e.g. You may need to take Physics and Chemistry earlier than the recommended plan from your department.

Also if you cant get the classes on your Plan A, you need to have Plan B already ready as the class sections fill out very fast. As a Freshman you have last dibs on classes after Senior/Junior/Sophomore.

2) Meet the General Education requirements for each UC campus you are applying along with the major prep course requirements. If possible, get the GE Reciprocity letter from UC Merced which would fulfill the GE requirements at any UC. 

3) Have a competitive GPA for your major. 

The UCs have published campus-by-campus list of major preparation paths for certain majors and that is a good place to start your research on intercampus transfer requirements, since the UC’s to do not have articulation agreements between campuses.  

Berkeley generally discourages intercampus transfer and accepts arounds 95% of applicants from California community colleges. 
Applicants with compelling reason for needing the transfer and those who have exceptional academic records and/or leadership potentials are more likely to be considered for admission. 

UCLA gives the same priority to intercampus transfer applicants as California community college transfer applicants. The rest of the UC campuses have varying degrees of preference but all will consider intercampus transfers but generally California community college transfers get priority to all the UC’s. 

I would consider completing your 1st year at UC Merced and then start at a local community college during the summer so you can possibly TAG to one of the participating UC campuses.
