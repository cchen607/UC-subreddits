1f8k283,berkeley,reminder to berkeley students to stop being so fucking pretentious,"i‚Äôm so tired of you all. the amount of people who turn their nose up at people after speaking to them once and kick down is actually mind boggling. say it with me: you are no better than the person next to you. get. over. yourself. if you feel attacked, then you‚Äôre exactly the kind of person i‚Äôm talking about. 

asking about high school accomplishments when you are literally in your 20s is embarrassing. putting other people down as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù and investing in exclusivity to stroke your fragile ego is embarrassing. crazy news: it‚Äôs possible to be good at things without needing to prove it by trying to outdo others with an air of haughty superiority. news flash: being a decent person is infinitely more important than how well you did on a random midterm or whatever momentary social win you gained. you can be a genius and fail at being a person. if you become important enough, you might even be able to get away with treating people you perceive to be below you like shit without facing consequences for decades and become a harvey weinstein of the world! congrats!! look at you go little rockstar! but do society a favor. take a break from chasing status symbols and take a good hard look at who you are without the external validators and where you‚Äôre headed. the number of As on your transcript, the number of followers you have on Instagram‚Äîall of these things come and go. most of you know that attaching your self worth to external signals of success is a recipe for misery and yet you still do it. please stop. it just makes you depressed when you don‚Äôt measure up to people more accomplished than you and arrogant when your resume is stronger. it won‚Äôt kill you to stop viewing life as a competition and open yourself up to the people around you. consulting clubs are a meme, but honestly this attitude extends beyond the club scene. 

Edit: some of the comments here are proving my point. 
Edit 2: for the bay area kids with a chip on their shoulder because they were rejected from Harvard/Princeton: i hate to break it to you, but if you had the skills and background desirable to ivy-tier schools, you would already be there. instead, you have a ego that outsizes your actual competence and you look down on the peers you convince yourself you‚Äôre so much better than. it‚Äôs honestly rather pathetic. perhaps take a moment of self-reflection to consider why you were rejected and work on self-improvement in lieu of lamenting the inferiority of your peers for cheap comfort. if you need to rely on exclusivity and gatekeeping to demonstrate how capable you are, then you‚Äôre really not very capable at all. 

there‚Äôs an inverse relationship between how proud you are of belonging to a certain elite club (whether that‚Äôs Cal or an Ivy) and how much you have to offer. if you really were exceedingly special, your work would speak for itself.",-0.93,Social

1cc7sdh,berkeley,Berkeley History: 82 years ago today about 500 Cal students were ordered to leave school and put in guarded camps because of their ethnicity.,"It's April 24.  It's 82 years to the day from April 24, 1942, when the Federal Government issued a ""relocation order"" that required all people of Japanese ancestry in Berkeley to report on May 1 of that year for transport to what were called ""relocation camps"". 

This included about 500 Cal students (including the valedictorian for that year), and some staff and faculty...as well as about 1,300 off-campus Berkeley residents. Other orders covered the rest of the Bay Area and most of California. 

Context: on December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. The next day the United States declared war against Japan and Germany. 

On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order #9066 which authorized the forced removal of people deemed a threat to national security from the West Coast. This was interpreted to include about 120,000 Japanese-Americans living in California--the majority of them (about 70,000) American born full citizens. (Ironically, there was no forced relocation of Japanese-Americans from Hawaii, which had a much larger proportion of Japanese ancestry in its population). 

Relocation orders went out from local West Coast military districts in April, 1942. 

The order for ""removal"" which included Berkeley was issued April 24, 1942. 

Everyone it affected basically had a week to leave their jobs, school, homes, and businesses and show up to register with a few belongings that could be carried. 

This threw the local Japanese-American community into complete chaos. 

**Imagine being told today that because of your ancestry you must leave school, abandon your classes, pack some luggage, and show up May 1 to be bused, under guard, to somewhere unknown for an unknown period of time?**  

Most of the students affected also had the same circumstances simultaneously affect their families. Ultimately, many people lost homes, businesses, cherished belongings, pets (which they couldn't take with them) and all sense of normalcy.

The ""assembly point"" for Berkeley residents was the First Congregational Church at Dana and Channing across the street from Unit III. If you're walking by there this week, you'll pass construction of a new building at that corner. That site is where everyone had to assemble. 

Buses lined up along Dana Street, and people were taken to Tanforan (a racetrack on the San Francisco Peninsula) and ""housed"" there in horse stables, until they were shipped to inland relocation camps where most of them spent the war years behind barbed wire and under guard, imprisoned for their ancestry, not their own actions. None of them were charged with anything; they were simply jailed. 

Here's a good summary for 2017--the 75th anniversary--of what happened in Berkeley.

[https://news.berkeley.edu/2017/04/24/campus-city-to-mark-wwii-evacuation-of-japanese-americans-75-years-on](https://news.berkeley.edu/2017/04/24/campus-city-to-mark-wwii-evacuation-of-japanese-americans-75-years-on)

It summarizes some of the local aspects of the ""relocation"". There was a considerable amount of deeply ingrained racism in California against Japanese immigrants, going back to the 19th century. And in early 1942, after Pearl Harbor, many local people also fully believed that a Japanese Navy attack could descend on the Bay Area at any moment. Both factors help provide context for--but not justify--what happened a few months later.

At Berkeley: some administrators, faculty, students, and community members criticized the forced ""relocation"". The ASUC Senate issued a resolution stating ""belief in the principle of judging the individual by his merit and its opposition to the doctrine of racism."" The University tried to find universities--often in the Midwest, outside the ""exclusion zone""--to take Japanese-American UC students as transfers. Grades for the spring semester were assigned based on midterms, since the students weren't in Berkeley for Finals. 

Here's some history on Executive Order 9066.

[https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/executive-order-9066](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/executive-order-9066)

Keep in mind that it was challenged in the courts, and upheld by the Supreme Court. So the full weight of the American governmental system--Executive, Congressional, and Judical--was officially behind it. 

In 2009, the Berkeley campus held a ceremony to give diplomas in person to 42 surviving Japanese American students who had been swept away from school in 1942.  Here's an article on that event:

[https://newsarchive.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2009/12/16\_japaneseamericans.shtml](https://newsarchive.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2009/12/16_japaneseamericans.shtml)

And a follow-up campus event in 2010.

1ez4d36,berkeley,Reflecting on my 8 years at Berkeley,"Today I finished my PhD, which marks the end of my 8 years at Berkeley. I started as an undergraduate freshman in the Fall of 2016, and finished my undergrad in the spring of 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Immediately afterwards I started my PhD in the same field.

It feels like a long time! I really got to know Berkeley over the years, and my relationship with the school certainly changed throughout this especially as I took on GSI and GSR roles. I'll say that I had some of the best experiences of my life here, along with some pretty horrible lows. I took over 200 credit hours in courses, taught a class, and published research here. I still struggled on midterms and finals throughout, and by the end, it really felt like I was getting too old to take tests. I learned that the undergraduates are graded a lot more harshly than graduate classes. I almost failed an upper division undergraduate chemistry class I took as a PhD student (although admittedly, I knew nothing about chemistry going into the class).

Berkeley is really a place where you will have the opportunity to meet people who can change your perspective. I came to Berkeley from a fairly sheltered community, and the people I went through college with help me see outside the bubble I was living in. There are so many interesting people, and so many events constantly going on. It's just as easy to get caught up in being social and forget to be studious as it is to be too studious to put yourself out there. There is a healthy mix somewhere.

For me, it was a little weird after graduating, staying around after most of my undergraduate friends graduated and moved on with their lives, especially during the pandemic. I think the way I interacted with campus was so much different when I no longer knew so many people. House parties, and studying on campus never quite felt the same after undergrad, and I'm not quite sure I was ever able to replicate the magic of how it felt then.

As I was packing my car with all of my stuff from my office, I saw the freshmen moving in. I couldn't help but smile and think back when I moved in years ago, and how awesome it was to live apart from home for the first time. Berkeley is a very special, and whether you are an incoming student or a jaded senior I hope that y'all make the most of your remaining time here.

1d3myu2,berkeley,"Being in the College of Engineering, I've realized my friends in the humanities are far more interesting and engaging to be around","I'm not discrediting any of my friends in the CoE, they've been helpful in study sessions and I enjoy hanging out with them outside the classroom.

With that, my humanities friends all offer intriguing insights into the world which I would never learn from my courses alone. It makes them far more interesting to be around in retrospect.

Just to list some of my friends, I have 3 of them majoring in Philosophy and they ask the most pragmatic, probing questions challenging the actuality of my knowledge. Some questions they ask me are insanely rigorous in a great way, as it's helped me question just how much, and just how truthful I actually know of a certain topic and the universe at large.

My Music friend has tried to meet me halfway with my skills, as I have toward hers. She's always inviting me to symphonies either on-campus or at San Fran, and is always playing the violin, piano with the largest smiles on her face. She explains to me how impressive it was that humans were able to apply Physics into vibrations so that we can broaden our insights of the world via a clearer voice of instruments speaking to us.

Comparably, 2 of my Theater friends invited me to their improvs. It's amazing how well they can take command of an entirely different persona on the stage, and they enjoy it, explaining how meaningful theater has been for them to learn, cherish, and assume global cultures encapsulated by their characters they practice.

And then my Public Policy friend, always inferring insights into the existence of a ""law."" He has explained to me how inequalities are latently exacerbated/remedied, the complexities of humans in a way I have never contemplated until now. It's substantial just how far the human race has evolved.

I can keep listing like 12 other friends on the top of my mind. My point stands that when it's my turn to share my insights and hope others can learn from me, I pale in comparison to their intrigue. How am I supposed to share interesting details of what I've been learning? ""Oh yeah, the other day I modeled a constrained optimization algorithm to simulate a virtual supply chain optimization."" That doesn't sound all that fascinating, if anything it sounds greedy and too detached from human experiences.

And then it hit me, I know very little of the world around me. I know very little on how America operates socially and culturally, I know virtually nothing about the cultural interpretations of other countries, the nuanced differences in their human conditions. I never realized I wanted to explore more meaning by learning about the humans around me until I arrived here. Now that I am here, I've acknowledged I'm actually very boring and chose Engineering for money's sake (I come from poverty).

And my friends who are great conversationalists, they are so much happier learning exactly what they wanted. I'm not saying I'm entirely unhappy, I just don't think I bring too much to the table with knowledge that isn't immediately ""humanistic."" And I guess based from what I've observed and from my own feelings, humans gravitate toward those that can exert more humility.",-0.43,Social

1eyawqx,berkeley,Berkeley screwed over my sister,"My sister who got in transfer Fall 2024 had great things going - good aid, new transfer apartment with very little floor mates, single room, her classes picked and everything. Then she gets an email saying to submit her transcripts, or they may rescind her offer, but keep in mind she had already done so a long time ago, but it always said processing, and that even counselors can‚Äôt see them until October. At least that‚Äôs what the counselor said to her when she called about financial aid shortly after, and that the email was most likely automated, so to ignore it. The email also said the deadline to submit was that Friday. But on Thursday (EVEN BEFORE THAT DEADLINE) she logged into her portal and it said her offered was rescinded! She tried to appeal, tried to call, and even drove up to Berkeley (we live in socal), and it seems like it‚Äôs pretty much irreversible and Berkeley won‚Äôt own up to it. They said to resubmit them and maybeeee see if she can get back in but she did but to no avail. They didn‚Äôt accept it, and she even got them expedited. All her stuff was taken away, and she had a full ride practically. Now she‚Äôs left without a school, since she already had said no to all the others. That is probably the worst thing that could happen rn. What a shame :(

EDIT: After constant emailing and contacting, she was able to get a hold of the chancellor and their team, and by a sliver of faith left and luck, she was told if she expedited her transcripts to them asap (literally over a weekend) that they would reinstate her. Initially, the still hadn‚Äôt received them but she even contacted parchment after explaining to her college in person to expedite them and they said they already delivered them and gave her proof to send them. So she did that and barely today they reviewed them and reinstated her! I know school started, but better late than nothing at all. 

Thank you to everyone who gave advice or shared a similar experience. I showed her all the comments and private messages, and she got a lot more faith that led her to where we‚Äôre at now!

I imagine practically everyone on this sub considers themselves amazingly experienced with Cal--but new students are not, and those questions (like *where to get a student ID, how to use the RSF, can you take food back to your room from the dining commons, how long does it take to walk across campus, should I bring a bike...*) are not stupid things.

1ccn6xo,berkeley,I'm tired of the f*tishization of CS majors,"The females on this campus are out of control. The first time I ate lunch wearing my EECS shirt -with fully covered legs, mind you- I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

Anyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 3 months and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last lab assignment. Girl, I have no issue with labs. I'm an EECS major, not ENGR. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT in fact want to copulate in the Moffitt 4th floor bathroom, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am enrolled in the hardest program on campus (which was not difficult for me to get into, by the way).

The worst are when students from non-technical majors talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: ""What's your major?"" As soon as I say those two magnificent letters, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the quiet whimpers. What makes an art major think they have a chance with me. CS and Liberal Arts are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that paints happy little trees for ""work‚Äù.

You may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in ENGR (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in the world in LoL. My Citadel shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch Rick and Morty with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout ""pickle rick"" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic episode of season 3. Not that I cried.

If you want somebody for cheap sex, the ENGR majors are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding ENGR though). Stop f\*tishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was an ENGR major, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. But I have a responsibility now to save the world and create the next OpenAI. Even being Oski the Bear isn't going to make me want to get with you.

I'm an Asian guy who stands at 5'5"", and let's be real, I‚Äôm not exactly a model. I work out regularly, have a decent physique, and I‚Äôm pretty good at socializing. I've got a bunch of female friends who genuinely enjoy hanging out with me. We do everything from grabbing lunch to hitting the gym, and it's always a blast.

But when it comes to dating, it‚Äôs like I hit a brick wall. Whenever I show interest in someone, things get weird. Some girls have even told me straight up that while they enjoy my company, they‚Äôre just not physically attracted to me. :(

One recent experience really stung. I had this friend I was into‚Äîwe‚Äôd eat out, work out at the RSF, and study together at a boba shop. We were always laughing and having a great time, so I thought we clicked. One day, she introduced me to her friends, and when one of them teased her about how we could make a cute couple, she made this disgusted face. I played it cool, but it hit hard.

Later that week, I told her I was interested, and she said she only saw me as a friend. To add salt to the wound, I found out from a mutual friend, who‚Äôs tall, good-looking, and a bit of a jerk, that he recently hooked up with her. She had told me she doesn‚Äôt care about looks and values personality more, so I thought I had a chance. Clearly, I was wrong.

This isn‚Äôt a one-time thing, either. It keeps happening. Girls tell me they like my personality, but when I want to be more than friends, they‚Äôre not interested. A few of my female friends have bluntly said I‚Äôm just not attractive and too short. It‚Äôs hard not to feel bitter and jealous of those guys who are born with good genes and have no trouble dating.

I know I have a lot to offer, but it‚Äôs tough not to feel insecure. Am I doomed to be the fun friend forever? Just needed to vent. Thanks for listening.",-0.43,Mental Health

1glg0o4,berkeley,The *real* truth,"People keep posting about how it's bad to just say half the country is racist or homophobic, and instead we should blame Dems. Here's what I have to say about that:

When you vote, you take responsibility for that vote. Anyone who voted Republican had more than enough information to know they are voting against women's rights, gay/LGBT rights, and in favor of massive tax breaks for the wealthy. You can't expect to vote that way and then respond angrily when others take that vote as you intended it. It's totally fair to hold people accountable for that vote - making a vote is making a decision, and making a vote has consequences. If you voted Republican, you voted for prejudice, racism, and misogyny. This is just the truth. If people don't want to take responsibility for that, then that's on them. Maybe they aren't those things and felt they voted for another reason - but you can't have one without the other; you can't say I want to vote for Trump just for economic policies, and not also be voting for him to send in the ICE teams to separate families, or make a nation-wide ban on access to reproductive health.

I would actually say that if Dems don't hold Republicans accountable, then they are assuming they are too stupid, homophobic, etc. to be responsible for their vote. These are m-fing adults - you, if you voted that way, you are an adult and when you ticked the box for Trump you ticked the box for hate and division. You did that. Dems didn't do that. I didn't do that. That was you, and you are responsible for that choice.

I agree that saying all these voters are stupid is wrong - most of them are 100% smart enough to know they were voting for a potential dictator and they chose to do that anyway. They sat down, thought about it - or chose not to really think about it - and made that mark. When this goes badly, they should take that responsibility and wear it.

Not to say Dems didn't fk up - can you imagine how bad at your job Biden has to be to think he should have run again? - but never, ever give the Trump voters a free pass. They knew. They know. I know that's the truth, and I hold them to it.",-0.87,Politics

1dmgte1,berkeley,"The atrocity of the rebrand goes far beyond the social media ""B"" icon","Most of the outrage about the Berkeley rebrand is directed to shortening of the logo to the ""B"" icon now used on the social media accounts. While this icon is indeed ugly, I don't even think this is the worst aspect of the redesign.

The Berkeley logo is originally based on a custom font that Frederic Goudy designed for the UC called [University of California Old Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California_Old_Style), and the previous logo replicated the original font more faithfully. Notably, the thickness of the letters greatly varied from the beginning to end of each stroke. The shapes of theses strokes reference [Venetian typefaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiqua_(typeface_class)#/media/File:Jenson_1475_venice_laertius.png) from the earliest days of the printing press, which sought to emulate the careful hand of a calligrapher. Each stroke in the ""B""  came nearly to a point at its ends, the ""e"" had a slight upwards curve for the cross-stroke and sharper corners, and the tip of the descender of the ""y"" came to a sharp edge tilted along the same axis as the cross-stroke of the ""e"".

https://preview.redd.it/7irz09uby98d1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3942824155ba03aefdbb2fddb652bd5d19041882

In the name of ""performing better in digital spaces,"" the redesign opted to make the thickness of these strokes more even. In addition to the alphabet block ""B,"" the cross-stroke of the ""e"" is now completely straight and the tip of the descender of the ""y"" ends in a circle.

* don't waste your time lobbying or complaining the marketing department, University spokespeople, etc. They are not the decision-makers. **The ultimate decision-maker in this case will be the new Chancellor, who is himself a Cal alumni.** He could easily decide to overturn or ""pause"" this poorly conceived decision upon entering office. That's a relatively easy time to ""make changes"".

[Edit; appended my reply below to a commenter that brought up important and valid points related to the consent of non-participants]

Even though nudity is not inherently sexual, and the point of the run is not exhibitionism‚Äîexhibitionism being to derive sexual pleasure from exposing oneself/one‚Äôs sexual acts‚Äî as some have argued, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that some people do have trauma related to nudity, often related to said strict taboos/connotations. Here are some of my ideas to make the run more consensual on behalf of the people in the library that are not participants:

1.	‚Å†Have an organizer/participant of the run announce that the run will include nudity and that nudity will be present, explicitly stating the floors where nudity will occur.
2.	‚Å†Designate a nude-free floor for people triggered/not consenting to see nude people, giving people time to relocate to that floor before the run starts.
3.	‚Å†Posting signs on entry ways of the floors said run goes through: ‚ÄúNudity present on this floor from *start run time* to *end run time*‚Äù

this incident really scared me and i wanted to ask does this usually happen to you guys? :( should i have done smt ? i thought if i just kept my head down and avoided them, they‚Äôd leave me alone but ig not :(

1gmctn9,berkeley,Doing research has made me feel like I don't belong here...,"Hey everyone, I just have to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm a senior, and I‚Äôve been working in this lab for around a year now, but recently I got some unexpected news: my PI wants me to continue on as a PhD student under him. It‚Äôs the kind of thing that people dream about for years, right? Getting picked by a top researcher to lead your own projects? But the more I think about it, the more it feels like a joke, and I‚Äôm the punchline.

I didn‚Äôt exactly come into this program with a prestigious background. Before I transferred to Berkeley as a junior, I worked at my family‚Äôs noodle shop, spent most of my free time trying to make ends meet, and only started doing research in my junior year after transferring from community college. The fact that I‚Äôm even here feels like a fluke sometimes. I barely knew what a pipette was when I first started, and now I‚Äôm supposed to be leading cutting-edge research? How did I go from being just another student trying to figure out the basics to being given this major responsibility?

What really hurts is how this news has affected my relationship with my 5 other lab mates, who all got admitted as freshmen and have been working the lab much longer than I have. They have multiple publications, presented at major conferences, done internships at prestigious FAANG companies, and they all generally have their lives together. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm just sitting here hoping I don‚Äôt spill my coffee on the lab notebook or accidentally blow up the centrifuge. Every time I ask a question, it feels like I‚Äôm interrupting their flow. I feel like the awkward outsider who was accidentally allowed to stay after the tour. Somehow the news is out that I got selected to do the PhD. and they didn't, and they all seem to resent me for it. One of them even told me that I ""don't really belong here"", and I makes me just want to throw away everything I've worked for and all the opportunities I've been given and leave the lab. 

Up until now, I've tried my best to keep my head down, do my lab work, and try to learn something along the way. I‚Äôve been given this huge responsibility, but it feels like no one actually thinks I‚Äôm up to the task. The Professor keeps talking about how he sees potential in me, but honestly, I have no idea what that potential is. He‚Äôs so calm and wise, like he‚Äôs always ten steps ahead of everyone else, and I‚Äôm just scrambling to keep up. He‚Äôs been here forever, while I‚Äôm just this... noodle shop kid with no real training. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs just waiting for me to prove that I belong, but it feels like I‚Äôm the only one who hasn‚Äôt figured it out yet.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on my Postdoc advisor. He‚Äôs been tough, but fair, I guess. He doesn‚Äôt give a lot of praise, but when he does, it‚Äôs always about how I need to step up. I've noticed that he tends to play favorites  with the other undergrads, and now that he found out that I got selected for the PhD, he expects me to have become an expert overnight, while simultaneously telling me I'm not cut out for the job or how ""its not my destiny""...

I don‚Äôt feel ready. I don‚Äôt feel qualified. I‚Äôm just waiting for the moment when someone realizes I‚Äôm not the right person for the job. It feels like I just dropped into this situation as some kind of cosmic accident. When I talked to the Professor about how I feel, he simply smiled and told me that ""there are no accidents"". I know it‚Äôs an honor, but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs mine to take.

So now, I‚Äôm stuck here, doing my best to convince everyone (and myself) that I actually belong in this lab. I don‚Äôt want to be the one who lets everyone down, but every time I look at my peers, I feel like they‚Äôre so much more prepared than I am. They have their lives together. I have this huge project to manage, some advanced genome sequencer called *DRGN warRIOR*, and no idea how I'm supposed to be qualified enough to fulfill this destiny I have been given.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready, but I also don‚Äôt know how to get ready. Some days it feels like I‚Äôm just playing pretend.

1fev0ro,berkeley,Remembering American Hero Mark Bingham - Golden Bear On Anniversary Of 9/11,"On the 23rd anniversary of September 11, 2001, California rugby remembers and honors Mark Bingham for the ultimate sacrifice he made on board United Airlines Flight 93.  
¬†  
The morning of Sept. 11, 2001, the United States erupted into chaos and devastation as terrorists carried out attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and at the Pentagon in Washington D.C. Flight 93 emerged as another hijacked plane that was threatening an attack on the U.S. Capitol Building. Former Golden Bear Mark Bingham was a passenger on that flight.  
¬†  
Bingham, along with three other American heroes, recognized the impending threat to the countless lives surrounding the capitol building and devised a plan to intervene. They stormed the plane's cockpit and, after a physical struggle with the terrorists, managed to thwart the hijackers' intentions, resulting in the plane crashing into an open field in Pennsylvania. Their heroic actions surely saved the lives of thousands in our nation's capital.  
¬†  
Bingham was a 6-foot-4 backrower for the Bears who was a member of the 1991 national championship team and a varsity letterwinner. He was a 1993 Cal graduate who earned a bachelor's degree in social sciences with an emphasis on international relations. Following his graduation, he became a public relations executive and formed his own company, the Bingham Group.  
¬†  
Bingham is regarded as an American hero and has been honored in many ways since his tragic passing. He was posthumously awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2002 ESPYs, and a biennial rugby tournament was named in his honor. The Bingham Cup is now recognized as one of the premier competitions for gay and inclusive rugby, for which Bingham was an advocate. Most recently, Bingham and Jeremy Glick, a fellow rugger and passenger on Flight 93, were presented with the Chairman's Award by the U.S. Rugby Foundation in 2021.  
¬†  
At Cal, Bingham's memory lives on in various ways, one of which being the ""Mark Bingham Award for Excellence in Achievement by Young Alumni"". The university established the annual award to commend a Cal graduate who has made a significant contribution to their community, country or the world. Cal rugby alumnus Stuart Shiff and his wife Josie also established the ""Mark Bingham Rugby Backrow Endowment"", one of 12 positional endowments that supports the program each year. On display in the Doc Hudson Fieldhouse at Witter Rugby Field is a charcoal impression of the etching of Bingham's name at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum in New York.

* First, that would be oversimplification fallacy.
* Second, I'd venture to guess these factors are not the main causes.

I'm quite late to the discussion, but the posts I've seen about loneliness and their general responses (*and subtle misogyny*) have been quite disheartening to see.

*Some comments from a recent post:*

* **Pseudoscience:** ""women are wired to find the best and most ideal mate, while men are wired to seek as many mates as possible""
* **Overgeneralization:** ""Chicks love tall physically big men""
* **Funny:** ""you seem to be a nice guy and women like that for friendships... that's not typically an attractive trait""

*edit: for clarity, I preceded with ""Funny"" because I found it amusing this commenter believes woman don't find being nice as an attractive trait*

Neither women, nor men, nor non-binary folk are a monolith. In addition, we're not that different to begin with.

Trying to play a ""bad guy"" or some other character that isn't you would neither be playing to your strengths, nor match you up with someone that actually fits you and would make a great relationship. It's okay to be single and can even be a better alternative.

Meeting people with the sole expectation of dating them will disappoint you. Build up your best self and build great, authentic relationships with the people around you. The rest will come.

edit2: If someone doesn't want to date you because of your ethnicity, why would you want to date them? There's other people that prefer what you might be insecure about.",-0.43,Mental Health

1. Her parents were both international grad students at Cal, working on their Ph.D's. Her father is from Jamaica. He's now a Professor Emeritus of Economics at Stanford. Her mother (now deceased) came to Berkeley from India to get her Ph.D. When she came here in 1958, it was still relatively unusual for an Indian woman to go overseas to the United States for college. (Their marriage was also out of the ordinary for their time--an interracial marriage, also of two people raised in different religions in different countries. Fairly commonplace today, but 60+ years ago, much less common in the United States at least.)
2. Kamala Harris was born in Kaiser Hospital, Oakland, delivered by a Berkeley doctor. Her parents were probably living in Berkeley at the time.
3. As a young child, Harris then lived in the Midwest where her father had various academic positions at Wisconsin, Northwestern, and U-Illinois. Her sister Maya was born in Champaign-Urbana.
4. When her parents separated, her mother returned to the Bay Area with both daughters. (Her father, as noted above, later returned to the Bay Area on his own, with a faculty position at Stanford).
5. In Berkeley, mother and daughters initially lived in an apartment building at Milvia and Berkeley Way. They later moved to an upstairs unit in a house at 1227 Bancroft Way, in west Berkeley.  They lived there (1971 to 1977) until Kamala Harris turned 12.
6. Kamala Harris attended a private kindergarten, then went to Thousand Oaks Elementary School in northeast Berkeley and, later, to Franklin School (which is now the Berkeley Adult School campus on San Pablo Avenue). She had a number of Berkeley connections, including taking ballet lessons at a studio on what's now MLK Jr. Way, and regularly going with her family to a community center the ""Rainbow Sign"" which was at Derby Street and MLK, Jr. Way. She also went to a church in Oakland with the African-American family that lived next door to the apartment in Berkeley.
7. When she was twelve, her mother, who was working at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, moved the family to ~~Toronto~~ Montreal where she took a research job at McGill University. Harris went through the rest of secondary school and high school in Canada.
8. She decided to attend Howard University in Washington D.C. where she got her undergraduate degree.
9. Then she came back to the Bay Area and attended what's now UC Law / San Francisco (then called Hastings Law), to get her law degree.
10. She worked in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office as a prosecutor. *(Edit: she also worked in the District Attorney's office in San Francisco. Then ran for District Attorney herself, see below.)*
11. She then moved to San Francisco and successfully ran for District Attorney. She was later elected California Attorney General, then Senator from California, then Vice President. She also later moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
12. Her mother had also moved back to the Bay Area, living in Oakland. She held another research job at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (on the hill above the the Berkeley campus).

He usually claims to be an EECS/CS major. These are all made-up lies. He never went to Cal at all.

He only posts about his supposed woes, never about stuff a normal student here would discuss, or any Cal-specific knowledge.

1fxppsg,berkeley,Rant: I have hardcore anti-football roommates :(,"Just using this space to vent that I have hardcore anti-football roommates. Even though we lost by a hair to Miami, it was so incredible to see our campus come to life like NEVER BEFORE. The energy from students, alums, and the community was INSANE. My older sister went to USC and the energy on that campus during football season was nuts. I never thought Cal could match that. UNTIL LAST NIGHT. 

I personally didn't camp out at midnight for Cal's very first College GameDay but I did walk by Memorial Glade in the morning and the crowd was UNREAL. The #Calgorithim, TikToks, that insane kick for $100k by the civil engineer sophomore. Even us being up by so much until the final quarter. We came so so close to winning against the #8 team! GameDay brought UC Berkeley so much national attention and money to our athletics department. I LOVE how much Pat McAfee got into the Bear Territory chant! It was so cool to have Marshawn Lynch on campus!

However, while campus as a whole was super vibrant and alive, unfortunately the vibes weren't great in my own dorm. I live in a triple with two other girls. One is an intended Ethnic Studies major and another wants to do Sociology. Both in their own ways are very, very far left politically. That on its own wouldn't bother me much. But they just have to be constantly super vocal about their politics, even over the most minor issues. They're very self-righteous and that's extremely annoying. 

Both of my roommates were party poopers and yucking my yum on GameDay. They asked how could I possibly be so excited for such an oppressive sport?

They argue that football institutionalizes the patriarchy - yes this is verbatim. They argue that since there's no popular female equivalent to football, the sport epitomizes and crystalizes our society's obsession with male sports, hence putting men above women. Second, they believe football is inherently oppressive and a tool of white supremacy as it destroys the bodies and minds of black and brown men. Voluntary choice is an illusion to them, as people get pushed into football as their ""only"" chance at a scholarship. 

Third, they believe football is inherently extremely dangerous given how easy it is to get CTE and repetitive head impacts. They say football normalizes a ""culture of violence,"" as evidenced by the high domestic violence rate among NFL players. Fourth, they think the billions of dollars our society spends on college football and the NFL would be better spent on social justice issues like homelessness. They say we vastly overpay college football coaches and staff, and should reallocate those funds for social welfare or education programs. 

Sometimes they even say really radical stuff about how we should abolish all team sports and only have individual sports like running because team sports can ""humiliate"" marginalized places that don't have the money for sports training infrastructure. They often promote completely unrealistic policies. 

Outside of this, they are extremely involved in anti-oppression and social justice rallies and protests. They were independently doing lots of Pro-Palestine protests over the summer. They will often critique others for using the wrong language or terminology. For example, they said I have internal misogyny for saying ""you guys,"" which I think is a super normal phrase. Interestingly, one of my roommates is white. They also shat on Berkeley for using the Kanye West song ""Power"" to promote GameDay saying Kanye's forever cancelled. And they will often say ""next song"" if we're playing a song from a ""problematic"" artist, no matter how mainstream. I've told them to stop and ""let's agree to disagree"" but they don't listen, they are constantly confrontational. 

I'd say I'm liberal myself, but I'm a more mainstream liberal and Democrat. I'm enthusiastically voting for Kamala Harris this fall and agree with her on the vast majority of issues. Her VP pick - Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is awesome and he's a former high school football coach! Liberals aren't anti-football. But my roommates hate the Democratic Party and are all voting third party. They have debates on Cornel West vs Jill Stein vs Claudia De la Cruz. They're active members of the Democratic Socialist Club at Berkeley and think AOC is too moderate for not being ant-Israel enough. 

Anyway, I know that while my roommates epitomize the classic overly-woke far-left caricature the right has of ""Berzerkeley,"" I am glad to see so many (for lack of a better term) ""normal"" people out yesterday on our campus. It was INCREDIBLE to see Cal students have so much enthusiasm for a ""mainstream"" event. 

Yes, my roommates may have valid critiques about football and its role in our society, but that doesn't mean we can't or shouldn't have fun! Part of college is HAVING FUN when we have such stressful classes. I want to major in CS and that shit's not easy! Being part of a mainstream American sporting event, even hearing the mass chanting of ""USA, USA, USA"" during GameDay felt GOOD. I loved finally hearing all the mainstream rock and hip hop songs during the game itself. 

I just wanted to rant that while my roommates are annoying, the campus as a whole was awesome yesterday! I'll make sure to branch out to ""find my tribe.""",-0.33,Social

1fq5t8s,berkeley,Safety Concerns On Campus,"Does anyone else feel like walking around campus this semester has been significantly harder this semester?

every day I walk to campus there is either someone smoking a crack pipe, or someone already intoxicated screaming, cussing out, and walking after people. I find that I am often the target of said people. I am a woman of small stature and have been followed TWICE in the last two weeks. One of these encounters included a man screaming that he ""was just looking for someone who wanted to fuck"" him. And I just had to let it roll off my back, because I had homework and studying to do.

I honestly like attending Berkeley, but this is just ridiculous. The police were called (not even by me, by a witness who saw me being followed) and they came significantly after the man had already left.

I want to emphasize that I do not blame the people withering away on our sidewalks as much as I blame our university for doing so little to help.

But the fact of the matter is, I feel unsafe at Berkeley. I am tired of being screamed lude remarks at, when I am just trying to get to class. I was walking through campus with a friend and he was immediately verbally assaulted with a series of slurs by a clearly intoxicated man.

I do not wish to villainize people who are clearly struggling in their own right, but I also do not understand why the university seems to turn a blind eye to this.

I am tired of being told that I am being sensitive for not wanting to be verbally assaulted, followed, and even in some cases spat on, on my way to class.

What can be done to help everyone involved?

I understand part of this is the take down of people's park, and although I also agree that the treatment of those who called it home was ridiculous. Now that the damage is done, I feel it is the universities responsibility to step in and help.

Edit:

I am thankful for the overwhelming support and those who shared their own experiences on this. I appreciate your feedback on what I can do, and what is just out of my scope.

I would like to acknowledge that for those who think I or ANYONE deserve threats of rape, being catcalled, being followed, being cussed out and called slurs.  Either because I should just grow thicker skin, or because I said in my post I do not want to kill or brutalize these people: you are actively part of the problem.

We must be able to talk about this without people immediately resorting to the most violent solutions possible, because it is inhumane and makes what would be a reasonable request, sound ludicrous.

Until we can stop blaming eachother for falling victim to various kinds of assault, or literally saying we should kill people in masses. Nothing will get done. Please be respectful of people in the comments sharing their experiences (good and bad!)

Lastly, if you have had an awesome experience on campus I am happy for you! I know you are in good company in that as well. This campus is renowned for good reason. However, I know I am not alone in feeling less safe on campus this year. both can be true! 

YES it could be worse. I still love this school, I still speak highly of it. The education is incomparable.

1cklbne,berkeley,What's the point of Berkeley Haas for entrepreneurship?,"Hi everyone,

I was recently admitted to Berkeley Haas as a CCC transfer. I turned down UCLA and did not apply to schools including Stanford and Ivy Leagues purely due to their lack of a Business major. I chose Haas due to the directly applicable business education, network of likeminded students, alumni and industry connections, entrepreneurship resources (incubators, labs, competitions, mentorship), and brand recognition as the #1 ranked public undergraduate business school. As a student entrepreneur, my post-graduation career plans are to continue pursuing entrepreneurship.

However, many friends and acquaintences (some of whom are incoming Berkeley L&amp;S transfers who were ineligible for Haas) state that Haas is essentially useless. For example, they've said that Haas is not a differentiator for student entrepreneurs, does not provide an advantage for entrepreneurial success, does not help in seeking venture capital (VC) funding as VC's ""don't care"" about your major, offers a useless curriculum that can be self-taught, and that the opportunities available to Haas students (which I listed above) can be utilized by any Berkeley student. I've also heard that most Haas students do not actually pursue entrepreneurship.

If these things are true:

* What's the point or value of Berkeley Haas for entrepreneurship at all? 
* Why is Haas globally ranked as a #1 public undergraduate business school?
* Why is it so competitive to get accepted with only 100 seats and a 5% acceptance rate? 
* What was the point of sacrificing &amp; working harder for Haas?

context in my original post from 2022: https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/s/t3Leg8wEgs

my life grew into something so beautiful shortly after posting that. 

when i posted that, i was anxiously applying to hundreds of (research) jobs and grad programs i was nowhere near qualified for and thought my time at cal coming to an end was me setting myself up to fail. i graduated last summer, with a fantastic job offer waiting for me. i work in the most stimulating research environment with the most supportive coworkers and boss, with very exciting opportunities to grow and network with some of the most accomplished living scientists. i never did research at cal because i couldn‚Äôt get a single professor to take me and my first collaborator in my new job has a nobel prize, wrote the cornerstone papers/textbooks on pain, and mentored a neuro professor i had at cal when she was still a trainee. all this and i shared cocktails with the guy while he told me some of the most wildest, most obscene stories from his life and legendary career!

from that post, i met my best friend who single-handedly made my cal experience what it was. given i‚Äôve been completely independent since and moved to the US when i was 16, i‚Äôve moved around one too many times to be able to establish roots anywhere. i thought i‚Äôd be all alone at cal, given my shy/introverted tendencies. this best friend not only made sure that never happened but i can firmly say he was *the* best friend i never had.

also not too long after that post, i met my now-partner. she makes me very happy. she has met my ex and immediately decided she did not like her. my ex ended up getting un-engaged from her partner and followed me to the bay area. i felt really bad for her because she just got her heart broken (yes i hear the irony) so i let her stay at my apartment for a few weeks. that quickly turned into like 3 months and during that time, i essentially helped cover a lot of her expenses like food and gas while she stayed under my roof rent free. as someone who has a hard time saying no, my partner helped me evict my ex from my place and i‚Äôve since cut all ties with her (going on two months now!). anyways my partner and i travel, grocery shop, cook, watch movies, take long drives, and just laugh together. she‚Äôs so awesome.

some other things that happened since making that post: i know what career path i want to pursue, am in a great position to advance my career, and plan to apply to PhD programs next year (including one here). i got my first tattoo, then all at once my next seven as well as a nose piercing - all things i‚Äôve wanted since forever!

anyway, all this to say, if you‚Äôre still a student - especially if you‚Äôre a transfer and/or just trying to survive, find your people, figure out what the hell you‚Äôre doing and what you want - this is me telling you, i made it through and so will you. you‚Äôve got this. you‚Äôll accomplish whatever it is you‚Äôre manifesting. 

and i thank the people who commented on my original post. i was so broken 2/3 years ago, i couldn‚Äôt believe in anything even remotely positive. i‚Äôm so glad a lot of the affirmations (and virtual pats of half-pity, half-sympathy) came true. :)

I was heading off to an [redacted] location to do it until l sense someone's presence using their shadow and their reflection within the mirror on the side. I thought it was just a random pedestrian on a bike until I got bonked to the back of the head. Everything just suddenly went blurry and slowly fade to black to the point of collapsing.
This happens near Martinez commons. 

I was carrying a totebag and suddenly I felt something pierced straight through my right biceps where my totebag was at that time. I straight up immediately regained consciousness and try to figure out what was going on. I saw a metal pipe basically ""inserted"" in my right arm. I quickly realized that he was trying to either get that pipe underneath the tote hook or force it to slip it out of my hand entirely. 

l immediately reacted by curling up my right arm so that my right bicep can get a grip of the metal pipe and use my left arm to get a hold of it. I wanted to use that pipe to yank the homeless man off the bike to my left and spear him dead myself. However, because I was wearing a nylon coat, it can't grip properly. He knows it too and immediately disengage. 

After that, I like ran in zig zags to like trying to get him off but he was still chasing. It was a good solid 6-8 minutes chase until I saw basically a free intersection and just made a ran for it. Out of nowhere there was a Nissan Altima that spawn in and it was speeding at like ~65mph. While I basically like illegally crossing, I turned back and saw him aiming straight at the back of my head trying to straight up spear me dead.
At the same time the Nissan Altima was NOT slowing down. I was basically flanked in multiple directions. Either I'll get run-over by a Nissan Altima that day, or get assassinated. 

I straight up said fuck it, raised my hand up in the air like King Baldwin IV so he can slow down (he didnt). There was loud as fuck honking but l made it out alive. The chase stopped. l immediately go to eTang but they made me wait for ~1 hour. By that time, I had the midterm and straight up said fuck it. I eloped from e Tang and locked the fuck in for both the midterm and lecture. I was about to lock the fuck in for my other classes until I started fainting to black again so yea.

A friend was able to take me to the basement of UCPD to file a report. But because of how this happens at THE SIDEWALK of Martinez Commons, this was under the jurisdiction of Berkeley City Police and NOT UCPD. UCPD was unable to take my report. It wasn‚Äôt until I have to go to Etang, where they make me sit and reconsider about this stupid school for 7 hours they were able to finally do something with UCPD.

Assassination attempt 2:

I got impatient with ETang, straight up said fuck it, and eloped. Right after I eloped another homeless man was sitting Thanos endgame style, and ready to lob a rock at me. I was like I‚Äôm fucking done and ran.

Assassination attempt #3:

The next day I was SEVERELY internally bleeding and started coughing up blood. After I literally just got off from the ER and there was another homeless man who tried to wack me with his skateboard at downtown bart station. This happens ~ 6

Assassination attempt #4: 
I was out at night (~2AM) due to relationship problems and another homeless man just woke the tf out of nowhere and started aggressively chased me with a knife near the tennis court. Luckily after a few zig zag run later, I was fine. 

I don‚Äôt even know how to process this. Here‚Äôs literally proof. I‚Äôm too tired to make this shit up deadass

Moral of the story:

I‚Äôm Batman.

This is a HIGH CONTROL GROUP.

They will lure you with free food and fun activities. The older people will shower you with attention and boba. Please do not get roped in. You will end up wasting your time, money, and life.

1fxzcuy,berkeley,Rant: I have hardcore pro-football roommates :(,"Just using this space to vent that I have hardcore pro-football roommates. Even though we barely lost to Miami, my roommates acted like it was some kind of tragedy. All they could talk about was how ‚Äúalive‚Äù campus was during the game, and they kept going on about the ‚Äúenergy‚Äù of the students, alums, and the community. They kept comparing it to their sister‚Äôs time at USC and how the vibes there were supposedly ‚Äúnuts.‚Äù Like, okay, I get that you had fun, but does it really need to take over our entire weekend?

They wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about how they walked by Memorial Glade and how ‚Äúunreal‚Äù the crowd was for the College GameDay. They wouldn‚Äôt stop showing me TikToks, and talking about that kick for $100k by some sophomore. I get it, football is a big deal for a lot of people, but it‚Äôs just not my thing. They think it‚Äôs so great that this event brought ‚Äúnational attention‚Äù and money to our athletics department, but come on, there are so many other causes that could use that spotlight and funding.

My roommates kept shouting about how great it was that Pat McAfee got into the Bear Territory chant and how cool it was to see Marshawn Lynch on campus. But honestly, I just couldn‚Äôt get excited about any of it. They went on about how this game supposedly put Berkeley on the map, but it just feels like it‚Äôs a distraction from the more important issues out there.

I live in a triple with two guys who are very, very into sports, particularly football. They‚Äôre all about it‚Äîlike the whole dorm was echoing with their cheers and chants. It‚Äôs not the football fandom that bothers me exactly, but they‚Äôre just so loud and act like football is the only thing that matters. And, no surprise, they‚Äôre both majoring in business or econ, which isn‚Äôt inherently bad, but they act like those majors are the only things that are worth doing.

On game day, they kept saying how I needed to ‚Äúloosen up‚Äù and ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù the game. They called me a buzzkill for not being into it. I tried to explain that football is problematic for a lot of reasons. First of all, it‚Äôs the epitome of toxic masculinity‚Äîfootball‚Äôs aggressive nature literally celebrates violence. I tried to tell them that we could use the millions spent on college football for issues like homelessness or education, but they dismissed me. I mean, this sport is literally built on the backs of Black athletes who often end up with life-altering injuries, all for the entertainment of a largely white audience. They brushed me off like I was speaking a foreign language.

And don‚Äôt even get me started on how dangerous football is. The CTE risks, the constant injuries‚Äîit‚Äôs mind-blowing that people still glorify this stuff. But whenever I brought that up, they just went on about ‚Äúpersonal choice‚Äù and how it‚Äôs a scholarship opportunity. They always bring it back to the scholarships like that justifies everything.

They even made fun of me when I said that this obsession with college sports just feeds into the larger issues with hyper-competitive, capitalistic culture. Like, hello? Can we maybe think critically about what this means for our society? And the chants of ‚ÄúUSA, USA‚Äù during the game made me cringe so hard. It‚Äôs so nationalistic, but to them, it‚Äôs just all in good fun.

Sometimes, it feels like I‚Äôm the only one in this place who doesn‚Äôt think that football is the greatest thing ever. Yeah, I get that not everyone wants to have these conversations, but can we at least acknowledge that there are deeper issues at play here? I‚Äôm just trying to live my life without having to be reminded that the world is obsessed with this sport that, to me, represents so many things that are wrong with society. I can only hope I find some people who get where I‚Äôm coming from, because this constant enthusiasm for football is honestly exhausting.",-0.83,Mental Health

","My boyfriend has recently returned to university as a mature after a long hiatus from education. He is completing a fairly challenging stem degree and so I accepted he would have to commit more time to his work, but his reconnection with mathematics has become concerning.

He now spends a majority of his day 'studying mathematics', despite the fact I often see very little work being done. When I ask him how his work is going, he gets very defensive and refuses to open up, claiming it's in my best interest because 'it will be boring to me anyway'. He then retreats to his room, where I hear either classical music, or the now familiar voice of youtuber 'The Maths Sorcerer' through the door (Some kind of mathematics based motivaitonal guru).

He also has taken up chainsmoking during the day, which although I'm personally not too bothered by, has become another issue where he becomes very defensive. He regularly sends me studies and reddit anecdotes about the efficacy of chainsmoking as a nootropic, and how universities like MIT are littered with cigarette smoke from 'high performance humans'.

He goes so far as to tell me that all of the greats such as Betrand Russel, Einsten and 'Rachmandynoff'(?) were all habitual smokers (Anyone know who tf that last person even is?)

I've tried to contact his friends to see if he shares more about his new secretive lifestyle with them, to which I was told that he basically just talks about drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, eating eggs and doing mathematics without going into any further detail.

I feel like he has completely changed personalities and lives as some kind of isolated savant rather than my loving boyfriend and I have to fight to even spend time together. I want to try and maybe meet him where he's at and become more interested in what he's doing, but he just keeps everthing so secretive?

As a disclaimer, I genuinely enjoyed my experiences at Rayleigh‚Äôs before this incident, and believe they have some great staff members. To the Rayleigh‚Äôs bar tender and security guard who showed us with kindness and respect, thank you very much for the great service. I hope that your respect for patrons continues to serve as an example for your fellow co-workers to follow in the future. Above all, I hope that the Rayleigh‚Äôs staff may develop the courage to act with kindness and respect, leaving visitors with a taste of the love and inclusivity of the Berkeley community. 


I went to Raleigh‚Äôs today with my family to get drinks around 6pm for an hour, and then went to pick up some stuff on campus. Rayleigh‚Äôs was one of the last places open at 9pm, so we decided to go back for food. Me, my 80 yr old grandparents, dad, and sister/cousins (18 yr olds) came back and ordered food at 9:20. The blonde woman at the bar was super chill and helped out so much with our big order. Food started coming out at 9:35 and the last plate was out at 9:50. Right as the food started coming out, a staff member came to our table pressing my sister for supposedly lying to her. Apparently, when we arrived, my sister forgot something in the car and was about to go get it, but my cousin had to use the restroom. On their way to the restroom, this staff member approached them asking to see their IDs or to leave. They replied saying that they were having dinner with their family and carried on to the restroom. When she approached my sister at the table, she asked her why she had lied to her. My sister replied with saying that she was truthful about eating with her family (while we were all sitting there). The woman replied with saying that she has to leave because she has a beverage from the bar and doesn‚Äôt have a wristband, so I stepped in to tell her to mind her own business about my sister drinking a lemonade. The staff member sighed and and turned away saying she was going to get security. My dad followed to go talk to the security guard at the door, who was genuinely confused about what the issue was and told him not to worry and to enjoy our meal. After less than 10 minutes of undisrupted eating, the same server came back to tell us that we all needed to leave immediately because the patio was closed for a curfew. Not one staff member told us about the curfew despite of us ordering at 9:20; if we had known, we would have sat inside. Since we had just gotten all of our food, and there was no table inside to fit 8 of us, we told her to give us some time to finish our food. This time, she went to get her other co-workers to come tell us to leave. When my 80 year old grandparents asked for assistance in helping us get a table inside, the other co-worker denied and told them to stand and eat inside. Then the security guard at the front door came to tell us about the curfew, and we explained the situation, and he was kind enough to give us a few minutes to finish our food. As we closed our tab at the bar, the main bar tender insulted my dad telling him ‚Äúget out of my bar and never come back.‚Äù All of us were in complete shock for the lack of respect the staff had, especially in assisting my grandparents. Overall, please stand up for your relatives who have come so far to celebrate your achievements, and I hope many of you receive basic human respect if you do enjoy a beer at Rayleigh‚Äôs.

1d3lbln,berkeley,Newsom Proposes Massive Cuts to Middle Class Scholarship and No Expansion of Cal Grant (2024-2025),"With the state in a budget deficit once again, Newsom's revised May budget proposal aims to cut funding for the Middle Class Scholarship program by 80% ($510 million) for the upcoming school year. The program currently provides financial aid to nearly 300,000 students in UCs and CSUs. Newsom also plans to halt the expansion of the Cal Grant, which he has been aiming to increase funding for since 2022.

I turned around just in time just in time to watch a tree - not just a branch, but the entire tree - tip over and fall right where a bunch of students were walking. Thankfully nobody was hurt, but the closest guy couldn't have been more than three feet away and given that the weather will be like this for another week or so it got me wondering. I'm definitely a person that notices trees more than most people already but now with this context I can see a lot of potential accidents waiting to happen with the trees on campus, especially the Coast Live Oaks which have very precariously twisted branches. Will the university at least cover my medical bills if I get hit while walking to class?

They are a high control group and eventually, they will try to control almost all aspects of your life including what you do after college, where you work, who you live with, when you date, and who you marry. But first they will love bomb you and constantly text you and reach out to you.

Please do your research before joining this group! Read the Christianity Today article about them (their previous names are Gracepoint and Berkland). They have branches at tons of schools.

1fazsv9,berkeley,Why the f-ck are Berkeley students so aggressive? (the squirrel perspective),"Bro?? I'm sitting there on a campus bench eating lunch (a peanut someone had handed me) and the student ran up on me like a mf. I won't forget that shit...  

The student sat down on the bench like it belonged to them, didn't even ask if I would mind having their company, and I had to jump off into a bush to avoid getting crushed. I dropped my peanut on the ground and they STEPPED on it! I can't eat a peanut like that, what do they think I am, a pigeon? That was my LUNCH. 

Anyway, I have similar experiences with students all the time. During the summer it feels nice and quiet and all of us Cal squirrels can hang out on campus in peace and investigate garbage cans and bask in oak trees and taunt dogs, but come the end of August all these thousands of students descend on the campus like an invading horde and mess things up. Most of them won't even share their food with us, even when we climb their legs and ask really politely. 

It's not like they even want all that food, they throw half of in the garbage or drop some of it on the ground all the time. And they have many more ways of getting food. Have you ever seen a squirrel with a card to swipe? Me neither. And yet they think ALL the food and seats and lawns on campus belong to them.

And most of the time when I'm out there peacefully digging a hole in the lawn to bury my lunch for December, some student walks right across my hole, or even sits down right where I was digging. Like there aren't acres of empty lawn where they could sit??

What's up with that?

Each year we squirrels talk about creating a SquirrelOrientation program to show the students how to properly behave on campus. But because we're rodents with short attention spans, we never seem to get it organized. 

What was I talking about?  

And do you really NEED that sandwich...?

1fgokt0,berkeley,"If you're feeling depressed and lonely here, THERE'S HOPE.","I transferred last fall and was so incredibly miserable my first year at Cal. I made 1 one friend during my first semester, but didn't prioritize that relationship as I threw all my focus into an unhealthy relationship. I didn't go to a SINGLE social event and didn't join any clubs. I never hung out with my roommate, and by the time I did want to, she had already moved out. I walked around campus never feeling like a person, but a number that no one cared about.

The second semester came and hit even harder. I was consistently giving into bad coping habits (binge eating, isolating myself, etc.) and felt the most suicidal and depressed I had ever felt in years. I spent my birthday alone. I started seeing a therapist at this time which helped immensely. I tried a handful of clubs, trying to put myself out there. I felt super connected at some club meetings, and completely out of place in others. I stuck with one club and found my closest friend through that. However, I still felt like I didn't belong anywhere. I still spent many weekends alone.

This is now my third semester and I could cry at how different things have been for me now. I've become more open to the people around me, and they've been receptive to it too! I started working a job with great people, volunteering with 2 orgs I'm super passionate about, talking to the strangers next to me in class (so now I have someone to sit with every class which is a first), and have invested A LOT of time and effort into the friendships I want to deepen. I realized that I have to take responsibility for my own life and well being, and many times that means doing things that make me uncomfortable (such as organizing meetups with strangers or asking the person I met just once to grab dinner or even intentionally going out alone to do something solely for myself). It takes so much energy to build a social life and you'll definitely go through a lot of rejection, but it's so so worth it.

Here's one article. There are plenty of other variations online, but they mostly have the same basic information.

[https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/berkeley-student-od-coroner-report-19482825.php](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/berkeley-student-od-coroner-report-19482825.php)

Key quotes from the story, if you don't want to read the full story:

*""...died of an accidental overdose, according to the Alameda County Sheriff‚Äôs Office.*

*A coroner investigator‚Äôs report provided to¬†SFGATE on Tuesday showed that Troper had high concentrations of alprazolam, an anti-anxiety medication sometimes branded as Xanax, in his system when he died, as well as cocaine, amphetamine and¬†hydroxyzine, an antihistamine sometimes used to cut cocaine. The levels of alprazolam and cocaine found in his blood could be high enough to cause death, according to the report. Low levels of THC were also present.*¬†

*The report lists ‚ÄúAcute Combined Drug Toxicity‚Äù as Troper‚Äôs cause of death and notes it was ‚Äúaccidental.‚Äù Despite some speculation¬†that the teen had overdosed on¬†fentanyl, the synthetic opioid was not found in his system, according to the toxicology report.*¬†

*The coroner investigator‚Äôs report notes that ‚Äúsuspected illicit and prescription drugs, including¬†Percocet and Oxycodone were found in abundance‚Äù at the scene and that there was no evidence of physical trauma.*

*...Both cocaine and alprazolam are common drugs of abuse among young people, according to recent publications...*""",-0.53,Politics

I twiddled my thumbs in the nonprofit sector for a few years and now I‚Äôm a stay at home mom who is also homeschooling my kids lol. 

I often regret not choosing to study something that would have actually led into a career or at least have given me some useful specialized knowledge (I guess my particular historical interest has been useful in the past few years of political movements.) 

Anyway I have a younger sister who is going to a university in England and she had me look over one of her essays. It was atrocious to be honest but she got a B on it. I read more of her school work and then started going through her assignments. It felt like high school assignments.

It gave me a sense of appreciation for the education I got at Cal. I had really excellent professors that pushed me to become a stronger writer, better researcher, and more effective reader. I learned a lot (albeit not very useful in daily life and I forgot most of it - but that‚Äôs my fault.) I also just had a pretty good time in general.

He sent us the raw photos from our shoot but the package we bought includes 44 edited photos which he never sent. After sending him multiple messages, he kept pretending as if he had emailed them to us, and eventually he just ghosted us all together. After reading [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/hey-darling-studio-by-nico-garibay-oakland) reviews (which we should have done before hiring him), it turns out he has done this to countless others ‚Äî many people even said that he never sent them a single photo after they paid him hundreds of dollars.

What‚Äôs more, during the photoshoot he made an antisemitic joke and did a Nazi salute towards us, which was incredibly inappropriate and unacceptable. This kind of behavior is not at all surprising after reading further into the yelp reviews where many women posted about him sexually harassing them during their photo shoots. Some women said that he made creepy comments while taking photos and asked them to come over to his place after the shoot.

It turns out that Nico has been doing this for a long time.

1d3nrrc,berkeley,got accused of cheating when I didn't,"I got a letter that said I was observed using my phone during an exam. My phone rang and I turned it off.

I just got an email from student conduct. 

I'm just afraid of them pulling some lawyer BS like I can't ""use my phone during exam"" and because I technically did turn on my phone, I am subject to academic misconduct. I just don't want my grade to become an F. This sounds ridiculous but if they were to go to that length, technically the final exam logistics given never said no phones, it simply said no access to internet. They can't prove I used the internet. This sounds like such a ridiculous thing to even imagine saying but I genuinely don't know wtf to do.

S/o and thank you so much to this user who's asked to remain private, I still want to publicly acknolwedge you cuz you don't even know how much this means to me. I DO regret doing it in the first place AND I AM NOT ADVOCATING TO GAMBLE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY but I think I have a good strategy to win it back tonight and I just want to thank this generous individual for this opportunity.

Yes this is stupid, yes my parents will disown me, all of you are right for shaming me, and yes i accept full consequences. But deep down inside, I think i'm just built different. Wish me luck!

1h27hc8,berkeley,Thankful for life,"10 years ago, my life was a mess: academically, morally, socially, you name it. My family too. I lived in a small town in NC, and I would‚Äôve *never* thought that I‚Äôd come to California and be a student all the way at UC Berkeley or that I‚Äôd be living such a blessed life surrounded by close friends. This would‚Äôve been seriously unimaginable 10 years ago. Life is not random. I truly am certain that nothing happens outside God‚Äôs Providence. 

Sometimes, on a quiet day or after an evening class, I‚Äôll walk around Berkeley and just think how beautiful our campus (or at least, some parts) is and how wonderful life is. I highly recommend doing this, esp if ur a senior.

Very grateful to God for all the unmerited grace He has shown me these past few years. It wasn‚Äôt an easy ride, but still grateful for every moment. 

Happy thanksgiving! I hope each of you experience the peaceful sentiments of gratitude with your family / friends. 

Please remember to pray for the repose of the student who took his own life outside Unit 3. And to smile or do smth kind for folks around you who look down. Trust me, it makes all the difference in the world :)",-0.14,Mental Health

1cjddvb,berkeley,"Cal Sailing Club apparently facing eviction from Berkeley Marina sailboat dock, by City of Berkeley","The Cal Sailing Club apparently has used six slots for its small sailboats at the Berkeley Marina for about 50 years. The Berkeley City Manager has now proposed evicting them so those spaces can be rented to larger private boats for more profit for the City.

I should say that I'm *not* a part of the Cal Sailing Club and not familiar with the details of this particular controversy, but the organization has a good reputation and focuses on providing low cost or free opportunities for sailing on the Bay and teaching people to sail. And they make a compelling case in their petition (see links below). They say they provide 2,500+ people with free rides / sails on the Bay a year, and have 1,100 ""active annual memberships"". They need their specific current location so their small sailboats can¬†*""maneuver in and out of the marina under sail.""*

I should also add that I'm not surprised to see the City wants more money here. This is part of a long term pattern. Key people on the City staff, IMHO, are focused primarily on ""generating revenue"", often undermining or killing popular community activities as a side effect. The popular Berkeley Kite Festival which thousands of people attended every July, and was held adjacent to the Marina in Chavez Park was done away with in this same sort of way, with the City suddenly demanding vastly increased fees for hosting the festival.

The Sailing Club has a petition on¬†[Change.org](http://Change.org), here:

Walking home from campus yesterday evening, I was walking past the Citi Bank on Shattuck &amp; U, and saw this little gremlin-looking creature crawling where I was about to step. I caught myself, luckily, and realized it was a little bat. After a minute of disbelief, I looked up the number for Berkeley Animal Care Services (510-981-6600). They advised me to get some kind of box to cover it with, and after that I waited for a short while while an agent came, put it into a little mason jar with air holes, and left. 

If this happens to you, as obvious as it may seem, *do not* physically touch the bat. If you have a box, put it atop the bat. The agent told me that they've had some positive rabies cases among local bats, and the fangs are so small and sharp that you may not even register having been bit. They're awfully cute though.

In the run up to the FSU game, it was the Wild West of shitposting and meming.   In grand old Cal football tradition we then lost a game we could and should have won in front of a national audience.

Cal Twitter death was loudly pronounced.  Except they forgot one thing which is we are use to losing and that doesn‚Äôt really stop the train.  Our team disappointing us is time honored tradition.  

Cal once was a week away from a number one ranking and we fumbled the game winning touchdown on the 10 yard line and then went and lost like five games straight‚Ä¶ahh memories.

Please consider changing the LinkedIn logo to the official UC Berkeley seal. I and many alumni are upset by the recent branding change, and feel that the new social media logo undermines the university‚Äôs brand recognition and credibility on LinkedIn. 

On first glance, the general public has no connection with or awareness of the new logo on social media, which strips the soul and spirit of the older look. Given the increasingly competitive job market, consider how this rebranding may negatively impact graduates entering the job market, as both recruiters and the general public will not recognize, and may even be confused by the new logo. I find it unacceptable that the official seal is not used for LinkedIn, as it is the largest professional networking site.

Fellow Bears,

As a UC Berkeley Public Health alumnus and current medical student, I feel compelled to share my doctoral dissertation on the most distinguished venues for answering nature's most pressing calls on campus. This isn't merely about finding a porcelain throne ‚Äì it's about the holistic convergence of gastrointestinal wellness, architectural aesthetics, and mindful meditation.

Through years of rigorous field research and peer-reviewed personal experiences, I've developed a sophisticated framework for evaluating these sacred spaces. My methodology considers crucial variables such as ambient lighting, acoustic privacy (essential for those morning coffee aftermath scenarios), and the elusive 'zen factor' that transforms a mere bathroom break into a transcendent experience.

As any seasoned public health professional knows, the choice of one's daily constitutional venue can significantly impact both physiological and psychological well-being. The right environment can turn a mundane biological necessity into a moment of scholarly reflection or pre-exam meditation.

Let me share my evidence-based findings...ranked accordingly to the evidence-based, aforementioned framework.

**(1) Pimentel Hall** **(1/10) - A Case Study in Architectural Antipathy**

Location: Basement Level, Lower Sproul Plaza 

Named after: Distinguished chemist George C. Pimentel 

Year Built: 1963

Ah, Pimentel Hall ‚Äì or ""The Pits"" as it's affectionately known by generations of traumatized OChem students. While this brutalist monument to scientific achievement houses one of Berkeley's largest lecture halls and has witnessed countless Nobel laureates' lectures, its bathroom facilities seem to have been designed by someone who clearly had a vendetta against basic human comfort.

The bathroom in question, accessible via a suspiciously dim stairwell that would make Edgar Allan Poe uncomfortable, resides in what can only be described as the building's forgotten catacombs. The facilities appear to have last been updated when Lyndon B. Johnson was president, offering visitors a authentic historical experience of mid-60s plumbing technology.

Notable Features:

* Temperature regulation that alternates between ""Viking Winter"" and ""Sahara Afternoon""
* Acoustic properties that turn every flush into a building-wide announcement
* Vintage graffiti featuring OChem reaction mechanisms from desperate students
* A persistent mysterious drip that has outlasted several department chairs

While the building itself has hosted groundbreaking discoveries in spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, the bathroom appears to be conducting its own long-term experiment in human endurance. The only redeeming quality is that the perpetual sense of despair perfectly matches one's mood after a particularly brutal chemistry midterm.

Pro tip: Best visited during Nobel Laureate lectures when the entire student body is trapped upstairs pretending to understand quantum mechanics.

Sustainability Rating: 1/10 - The only sustainable thing here is the sustained feeling of regret.

**(2) Valley Life Science Building (VLSB) (2/10) - Where Dreams of Med School Go to Die**

Location: Valley Life Sciences Building, 

Lower Campus Built: 1930 

Primary Clientele: Hopeful pre-meds, before organic chemistry crushes their souls

Ah, VLSB ‚Äì where the T-Rex skeleton in the lobby serves as a haunting reminder that some things are better left extinct, much like these bathrooms. While the building itself stands as a testament to scientific achievement, housing everything from preserved specimens to cutting-edge research facilities, its bathrooms appear to have been designed by the set decorator of ""Children of Men"" during a particularly nihilistic phase.

The stark contrast is almost poetic: above, you have the prestigious Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory gazing down upon VLSB like a disappointed parent, while below, these bathrooms offer an experience that makes the dystopian facilities in ""District 13"" look like the Ritz-Carlton. The ambiance perfectly captures that moment in ""Blade Runner 2049"" when K descends into the ruins of Las Vegas ‚Äì except instead of irradiated orange hues, you're treated to flickering fluorescent lights and mysterious drips that would make even a microbiologist nervous.

Notable Features:

* A peculiar aroma that has likely evolved into a new life form
* Lighting fixtures that flicker in Morse code, spelling out ""abandon hope""
* Mysterious stains that could be the subject of several PhD dissertations
* Acoustic properties that make every sound echo like you're in the ""Inception"" dream levels

The true irony lies in the fact that while students upstairs study the miracle of life and evolution, the bathrooms seem stuck in a parallel universe where sanitation never made it past the Mesozoic era. The proximity to the dinosaur exhibits feels less like an educational display and more like a warning about the state of the facilities.

Pro tip: Like the protagonists in ""The Maze Runner,"" your best strategy is to run ‚Äì preferably to literally any other building on campus.

Scientific Value: 9/10 

Actual Usability: 2/10 

Evolutionary Progress: -3/10

Warning: Exposure may result in a sudden understanding of why those dinosaurs went extinct.

**(3) Wheeler Hall** **(3/10) - A Neoclassical Nightmare**

Location: Central Campus, adjacent to hallowed ground where dreams of Stanford acceptance letters go to die 

Architectural Style: Classical Revival (1917) 

Named after: Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who clearly never used these facilities

Ah, Wheeler Hall ‚Äì that magnificent testament to Berkeley's architectural ambitions, where the ghosts of rejected English dissertations roam the corridors and freshmen practice pronouncing 'Foucault' incorrectly. While its marble-clad exterior whispers sweet nothings of academic prestige, the bathrooms tell a different, more pungent tale.

The facilities present a stunning dichotomy: pristine white tiles that appear to have been designed by someone whose only brief was ""make it feel like walking into a supernova."" The blinding luminescence serves the dual purpose of highlighting every questionable stain while simultaneously searing one's retinas ‚Äì perhaps a metaphor for the illuminating yet painful process of academic enlightenment.

Notable Features:

* Lighting bright enough to be visible from the International Space Station
* An acoustic design that turns every flush into a dramatic reading of ""The Waste Land""
* A persistent medieval bestiary of insects that would make an entomologist weep
* That one particular stall on the 2nd floor, now famous for its resident arachnid who's probably earned tenure by now

The perpetual sewer bouquet provides a humbling reminder that beneath our sophisticated veneer of literary theory and cultural criticism, we are all still mere mortals. The spider's web above the large stall serves as both a security system and a poignant reminder of the web of interconnected narratives we study in comparative literature.

Pro tip: Best visited between Victorian Literature seminars, when one can truly appreciate the Gothic horror of it all.

Historical Significance: 8/10 

Actual Functionality: 2/10 

Spider Companionship: 10/10

Warning: The blinding white interior may cause temporary existential crises and spontaneous recitations of T.S. Eliot.

**(4) Evans Hall** **(4/10) - The Concrete Confessional**

Location: Northeast campus, looming ominously like a bureaucrat's fever dream 

Built: 1971 Architectural Style: Brutalist (emphasis on 'brutal') 

Primary Inhabitants: Data Scientists pretending they're not just CS majors who couldn't get into CS61A

Ah, Evans Hall ‚Äì Berkeley's beloved tribute to East German prison architecture. This towering concrete monstrosity stands as a testament to what happens when architects decide that windows are merely a bourgeois construct. While Stanford's computer science department enjoys their Silicon Valley-inspired glass palaces, Berkeley's data scientists toil away in what appears to be a building designed by someone who mistook ""1984"" for an architectural handbook.

The bathrooms, however, exist in a peculiar state of quantum mediocrity ‚Äì neither notably horrific nor particularly praiseworthy. Like a C+ grade in CS61A, they're just... there. In a building where students contemplate the existential dread of linear algebra and probability theory, these facilities offer a surprisingly neutral refuge from the windowless rooms where dreams of tech internships go to die.

Notable Features:

* Water pressure that follows a perfect normal distribution
* Toilet paper holders that could be used as examples in STATS 101
* A view of absolutely nothing, maintaining the building's commitment to sensory deprivation
* Hand dryers that sound like they're computing Bitcoin on the side

The true irony lies in the fact that while students upstairs crunch numbers to predict the future, the bathrooms remain stuck in a perpetual 1970s time loop. Perhaps this is what the ""mid"" in EECS stands for.

Pro tip: Best visited during the golden hour when the concrete walls cast shadows that make you question whether you're in a bathroom or a modern art installation about institutional conformity.

Structural Integrity: œÄ/10 

Soviet Nostalgia Factor: 9/10 

Data Science Street Cred: sudo/10

Warning: Extended exposure may result in developing an unhealthy appreciation for concrete and a compulsive need to analyze the statistical distribution of toilet paper usage.

**(5) Latimer Hall** **(5/10) - The McDonald's Drive-Thru of Campus Relief**

Location: Chemistry Complex, where dreams of medical school meet reality 

Built: 1963 

Named after: Wendell Mitchell Latimer, who probably had a private bathroom

Ah, Latimer Hall ‚Äì the express lane of campus bathrooms, where efficiency meets minimalism in a space roughly the size of a reaction vessel. Like the chemistry department's version of a New York City micro-apartment, these facilities embody the principle that size doesn't matter (a lie we tell undergrads about their OChem reaction yields).

This bathroom facility, much like a fast-food value meal, provides exactly what you'd expect: nothing more, nothing less. It's the bathroom equivalent of ""good enough"" ‚Äì much like that lab report you submitted at 11:59 PM. The space management here is so efficient it would make Marie Kondo proud, though it's unclear if anything here sparks joy.

Notable Features:

* A footprint smaller than a grad student's stipend
* Acoustics that broadcast your presence to every passing GSI
* A sink positioned with the precision of a titration experiment
* That distinct smell of desperation and hydrocarbons

The true charm lies in its role as the preferred alternative to Pimentel's basement horror show ‚Äì much like how students prefer literally any other career path after their first semester of OChem. It's the bathroom equivalent of settling for your safety school: not your first choice, but hey, at least you got in.

Pro tip: Best utilized between the hours of 2:15-2:45 PM when most GSIs are busy crushing undergrads' hopes in office hours.

Efficiency Rating: 8/10 Size-to-Usage Ratio: 3/10 GSI Encounter Probability: 0.457 ¬± 0.023

Warning: May encounter bitter graduate students muttering about failed columns and rejected manuscripts. Avoid eye contact and back away slowly while showing your lab notebook as a sign of submission.

**(6) Dormitory Bathrooms  -- The Great Residential Divide: A Tale of Two Bathrooms**

**Blackwell Hall (8/10) - The Bourgeois Paradise**  
Location: Wherever the sun actually shines in Berkeley  
Built: 2018, when someone finally remembered students need housing

Behold, Blackwell Hall ‚Äì Berkeley's monument to social stratification, where the chosen ones reside in their gleaming tower of modern amenities. The bathrooms here aren't just facilities; they're spa-like sanctuaries where privileged students can contemplate their good fortune while sitting on porcelain thrones that probably cost more than a semester's worth of textbooks. The water pressure is so perfect, it makes even Stanford students jealous.

Notable Features:

* Motion-sensor everything, because touching things is for peasants
* Lighting that makes everyone look Instagram-ready
* Actually functional ventilation (revolutionary concept)
* Mirrors that don't make you question your life choices

**Unit 3 (2/10) - The Proletariat's Purgatory**  
Location: The shadowy realm where hope goes to die  
Built: Sometime between the Gold Rush and the Summer of Love

Ah, Unit 3 ‚Äì the living testament to Berkeley's commitment to ""character building."" Where the bathroom becomes a thrilling game of ""Guess What That Smell Is"" and ""Why Is The Floor Always Wet?"" The gender-inclusive facilities would be progressive if they weren't also inclusive to various forms of fungi and bacterial colonies conducting their own independent research projects.

Notable Features:

* Shower drains that double as unauthorized toilets
* A mysterious symphony of 3 AM sounds that would intrigue paranormal investigators
* Water pressure that alternates between ""gentle mist"" and ""fire hose""
* An ecosystem diverse enough to qualify as a biology field study site

The Nocturnal Experience:

* 2:00 AM: Mysterious sobbing (probably OChem related)
* 2:30 AM: Someone practicing their kazoo
* 3:00 AM: The ghost of failed midterms past
* 4:00 AM: That one person who decides to take a shower while practicing opera

Real-life survival tips:

* Always wear shower shoes (consider hazmat boots)
* Don't ask about the strange noises
* Pray for seismic activity to end your suffering
* Remember: what doesn't kill you makes you more qualified for grad school

Wealth Gap Rating: Wider than the Berkeley Hills  
Cultural Experience: Marx would write a sequel  
Earthquake Preparedness: Please, just one small tremor

Warning: Extended exposure to Unit 3 facilities may result in developing a superhuman immune system or a deep understanding of class warfare ‚Äì possibly both.

**(7) The Libraries' Hidden Chambers (6/10) - Where Knowledge Meets Nature's Call**

Location: Scattered throughout campus like ancient wisdom  
Focus: Moffitt Library &amp; Free Speech Movement Caf√© Area  
Primary Clientele: Sleep-deprived students and coffee-fueled academic hermits

Ah, the library bathrooms ‚Äì where intellectual discourse meets intestinal discourse. These sacred chambers, particularly those near FSM Caf√©, offer a uniquely Berkeley experience: the chance to simultaneously relieve yourself while overhearing the complete psychological breakdown of a CS major or the passionate whispered rant of a political science student questioning capitalism.

**The Moffitt Experience**  
Picture this: You're seeking refuge in these tiled confessionals, when suddenly you become an unwitting therapist to the adjacent stall's occupant, who's softly crying about their Medieval Studies midterm while simultaneously ordering their third cold brew of the day. It's group therapy, but with dividers.

Notable Features:

* Exceptional acoustic properties for eavesdropping on academic crises
* Toilet paper that's somehow simultaneously single-ply yet pretentious
* The persistent aroma of FSM's coffee mixed with eau de anxiety
* Graffiti that ranges from quantum physics equations to existential poetry

Perfect for:

* Introverts seeking the parasocial comfort of others' academic despair
* Students needing material for their psychology papers
* Anyone wanting to hear unfiltered opinions about professors
* Those seeking the authentic college experience of crying in a bathroom

Pro tip: Peak drama hours occur during midterms and finals, when the bathrooms transform into confessionals for academic sins.

Privacy Rating: 4/10 (walls have ears)  
Entertainment Value: 8/10  
Therapeutic Potential: 7/10  
Coffee Proximity: 9/10

Warning: May accidentally become involved in someone's emotional breakthrough or spontaneous study group formation. Side effects include developing a pavlovian response to the sound of coffee grinders.

**(8) Stanley Hall** (8.5/10) - The Enlightened Throne

Location: Northwest campus, where bioengineering dreams take flight 

Built: 2007 

Primary Clientele: Distinguished professors who've forgotten where they parked their Teslas and grad students pretending they belong

Ah, Stanley Hall ‚Äì the gleaming jewel in Berkeley's STEM crown, where the bathrooms are as pristine as the building's grant funding. While lesser facilities across campus struggle with basic functionality, Stanley's restrooms achieve a zen-like state of perfection that makes one question if they're still on a public university campus at all.

Perched majestically on the slope leading to the hallowed grounds of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanley Hall's facilities offer what can only be described as a spa-like experience for the academically enlightened. Here, one can contemplate the mysteries of protein folding or rehearse their Nobel acceptance speech in blessed solitude.

Notable Features:

* Pristine cleanliness that would impress a clean room technician
* Lighting that actually flatters instead of fluorescent-flickering your soul into submission
* Acoustic properties perfect for practicing your ""I just got published in Nature"" victory speech
* Water pressure consistent enough to be worthy of a PhD thesis

The true luxury lies in the silence. No mysterious pipes groaning like a failed experiment, no echoing sounds of academic despair ‚Äì just the peaceful serenity of a bathroom that actually believes in your research potential.

Pro tip: Best visited during faculty meetings when the building's inhabitants are elsewhere debating the future of science

Cleanliness Rating: NIH funding/10 Meditation Potential: 9.5/10 Impostor Syndrome Reduction: 7/10

Warning: Extended use may make returning to lesser campus facilities emotionally challenging. May also result in unrealistic expectations for all future bathroom experiences.

**(9) Dwinelle Hall (9/10) - The Labyrinth's Hidden Oasis**

Location: Somewhere in the space-time continuum of Central Campus  
Architectural Style: M.C. Escher meets Kafka  
Built: In multiple dimensions simultaneously

Behold, the greatest plot twist in Berkeley's bathroom saga ‚Äì Dwinelle Hall, where students enter seeking classrooms and exit questioning reality itself, somehow houses the campus's most surprisingly sublime sanctuaries. Like finding a five-star spa inside a quantum physics experiment, these facilities defy all expectations and possibly several laws of nature.

You'd think a building infamous for its non-Euclidean geometry and ability to make seniors cry would host bathrooms that match its chaotic energy. And yet, like a secret garden in a concrete maze, Dwinelle's restrooms stand as monuments to civil engineering done right.

Notable Features:

* Sensor-equipped sinks that dispense actually warm water (a miracle by UC standards)
* Pristine cleanliness that suggests a portal to an alternate dimension
* Gender-inclusive facilities that welcome all who've managed to find them
* A peaceful atmosphere that makes you forget you're in Berkeley's architectural fever dream

The true irony lies in the journey: while students spend hours lost in Dwinelle's twisted corridors trying to find their Comparative Literature seminar, those who stumble upon these bathrooms find themselves reluctant to leave. It's as if the building's chaos exists purely to protect these sacred spaces.

Pro tip: The challenge isn't finding a clean bathroom in Dwinelle ‚Äì it's finding your way back to it once you've discovered it. Some say there's a bathroom so perfect it appears only to those who've given up hope of ever finding their classroom.

Navigation Difficulty: ‚àö-1/10  
Actual Facility Quality: 9/10  
Spiritual Enlightenment: 10/10  
Probability of Finding It Again: 3.14159/10

Warning: May result in developing Stockholm Syndrome with a building. Some visitors report emerging from Dwinelle bathrooms to find themselves in different academic years or parallel universes where their classes were actually scheduled in Evans Hall.



**CONCLUSION:** Fellow Bears, as we conclude this comprehensive analysis of Berkeley's finest (and most horrifying) facilities, let us remember the ancient medical wisdom passed down through generations of doctors: *""The bowels are the window to the soul, but a clean bathroom is the door to sanity.""* \- Hippocrates (probably)

As both a medical student and a Berkeley survivor, I can confidently say that the quality of one's daily constitutional directly correlates with academic performance. Just as every great physician must know their anatomy, every wise Berkeley student must know their bathroom geography.

From the blinding white abyss of Wheeler to the post-apocalyptic landscape of VLSB, from the proletariat porcelain of Unit 3 to the bourgeois brilliance of Blackwell, each facility tells a story. But perhaps the greatest lesson lies in Dwinelle Hall, where against all odds and architectural logic, paradise exists within chaos. It stands as a testament to that old medical school adage: *""The best bathroom is not the closest one, but the one worth walking to.""*

Remember, dear colleagues, in the words of my attending physician: *""Just as we must be selective with our diagnoses, we must be selective with our digestive sanctuaries.""* Choose wisely, for your GPA ‚Äì and your gut ‚Äì may depend on it.

Final Rankings and Diagnoses:

* Terminal Case: Pimentel Hall (2/10)
* Chronic Condition: VLSB (2/10)
* Stable but Guarded: Wheeler Hall (3/10)
* Showing Signs of Life: Evans Hall (4/10)
* Ready for Discharge: Latimer Hall (5/10)
* Fully Recovered: Stanley Hall (8.5/10)
* Miracle of Modern Medicine: Dwinelle Hall (9/10)

Prescriptive Advice: When in doubt, hold it and hike to Stanley or Dwinelle. Your future self will thank you for the exercise and the excellence.

1f1bbnm,berkeley,Pro Tip for all students who want to join clubs,"When you search for clubs on Callink ( https://callink.berkeley.edu/organizations ) search for clubs **first** using the filter ‚ÄúBlue Heart Initiative Category‚Äù

All clubs labeled with a Blue Heart have open and/or minimal membership practices. 

**Only if** there is not a club under the Blue Heart category that truly doesn‚Äôt meet the experiences you want to have should you look at anything else.

As a new student or someone exploring clubs, you should get a chance to actually experience a club before finding ones to stay in long-term. Don‚Äôt waste a semester getting rejected for something ‚Äúcompetitive.‚Äù  Applying for a club does not equate to actually experiencing what that club has to offer.

TL;DR: Give yourself a fair chance at finding a club you like. Prioritize joining clubs that have a ‚ÄúBlue Heart‚Äù on Callink

1hbkth1,berkeley,Cal Alum‚Äôs Thoughts: Berkeley Does it Best,"The University of California, Berkeley, is the cookie cutter definition of a perfect university ‚Äî perfect location near Silicon Valley, San Francisco, and nature; perfect weather ‚Äî nice, sunny, mild; perfect campus; perfect faculty, who are all extremely accredited and in the tops of their fields (did I mention 9, YES, NINE, N-I-N-E, Nobel Prize winning faculty CURRENTLY teaching at Cal); research POWERHOUSE; hot students, good parties (Kappa Kappa Gamma‚Ä¶ those who know ;) ‚Äî even the furries are the valedictorians of their schools. And, of course, the University of California, Berkeley, is the NUMBER ONE public university in the WORLD (UCLA will continue to cry). The Berkeley name opens doors in every country and every corner of the Earth (hell, if aliens exist, they probably know of Berkeley). It is a household name in EVERY household; people only know about Harvard because of Legally Blonde, not for any relevant reasons (did Oppenheimer go to Harvard? I think not; on the other hand, the unibomber went to Harvard ‚Äî do with that information what you will). Private institutions plagued with legacy and internal agendas will never amount to the public service that a school like Berkeley provides, and small community colleges like Stanford (Brock Turner went there ‚Äî do with that information what you will) will continue to live in their delusions that our rivalry is equal. 

Berkeley puts all other universities, private AND public, to shame. On one hand, you have all the rich nepo babies infiltrating the ivy league ‚Äî and good luck trying to get into USC if your bank account isn‚Äôt in the octuple figures (plus, it‚Äôs not even worth it); on the other hand, you have trashy, ugly, ghetto, schools like UDub, that accept the entire population of Washington and give them all inadequate educations (also, Ted Bundy went to UDub ‚Äî do with that information what you will). There is no school on Earth with such distinguished faculty, ranking, location, and an unbiased admissions process. If you go to any other university, even a different UC, you will never get the education and job preparation that Berkeley provides in four years; ergo, there is NO POINT to go to college unless you are attending Cal. If you are the vast majority of people not qualified enough to get in, the only alternative I would recommend is trying to transfer in from CC (go to Stanford!). 

I have been in the workforce for twenty years post-graduation, and let me tell you, no one gets work done like a GOLDEN BEAR. It has gotten to a point where if I don‚Äôt see UC Berkeley on your resume, I throw it in the garbage (presumably, every other employer does this, too). It would appear that every other college is doing a subpar job of trying to recreate Berkeley‚Äôs excellence, and man, it shows. Berkeley will open doors, UDub will close them. To all you seniors in this subreddit ‚Äî go to Berkeley, or go home! Trade school isn‚Äôt that bad for the uneducated folk, and at least you won‚Äôt have a golden bear outdoing all your work. If worst comes to worst, go to Cal for grad school. Just go to Cal. Or move to Berkeley so you can revel in their glory from afar. 

- Go Bears!

TLDR: No school does it like Berkeley.

So I'm about to head out, but I realize I keep hearing ""Chebyshev"", it's easy to hear when it's whispered, try it, and I'm like hell no there is a toilet cheating ring.

I went back in my stall and hid on top of the toilet and leave the door cracked open. I bend over ninja style, almost falling off the toilet and try to stay really quiet, and I can see under that stall 3 pairs of shoes.

‚ÄúNo person shall operate or cause to be operated within a multi-family dwelling unit any source of sound or allow the creation of any noise which causes the sound level when measured inside a neighboring dwelling unit to exceed 55decibels for any period of time or 50db for any minute within any hour, etc.‚Äù

1crj5j1,berkeley,I am faced with a choice I never imagined  making: Berkeley &amp; Princeton as a transfer student,"I at last made younger me proud by fulfilling a lifelong goal: attending a 4-year and pursing my dreams of medical school.

Not so much med school any longer, but hopefully pave the road for a PhD in Chemistry a few years from now. I am fascinated by Materials Science, Biomaterials, pure Chemistry and how it can all be intertwined into developing and commercializing products derived from new Materials in health and neuro-regenerative applications. I applied Chemical Biology in CoC. I couldn't attend the Golden Bear welcome held a few weeks back, I asked for a day off work to drive up to Berkeley and do a self-guided tour next weekend. I figured it won't get better than Berkeley and was firm on my choice.

The week following Berkeley late-April into the past few days, I've been thrown the fastest curveballs of my life. I was given opportunities to Columbia, Dartmouth, UChicago, John's Hopkins, Duke and just a few days ago Princeton, which, as you may imagined made me cry tears of joy numerous times.

I think I narrowed it down to here and Princeton. My first thought was: Berkeley is one of the very few, if not the only with an entire college dedicated to Chemistry; that speaks volumes and perhaps doesn't get better than that. Then Princeton accepting me 4/5 days ago made me realize they have numerous labs in Applied Physics/Chemistry that may be appealing. The plane tickets are insanely pricey and I don't think I can go visit Princeton to solify an informed decision. Could anyone from CoC help talk about the ease of research and graduate opportunities?

Another Berkeley alumnus is honored, this time with a share of the Chemistry Nobel.","David Baker, a professor at the University of Washington, is one of three winners of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, announced this morning. **Baker received his Ph.D. in Biochemistry** **~~Chemistry~~** **from UC Berkeley in 1989.**

*Baker ""completed his doctorate in biochemistry at the*¬†[*University of California, Berkeley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley)¬†*in 1989 in the laboratory of*¬†[*Randy Schekman*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Schekman)*, where he worked predominantly on protein transport and trafficking in*¬†[*yeast*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast)*. In 1993, he completed his postdoctoral training in biophysics with*¬†[*David Agard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Agard)¬†*at the*¬†[*University of California, San Francisco*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco)*.*¬†

*Baker joined the Department of Biochemistry at the*¬†[*University of Washington School of Medicine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Washington_School_of_Medicine)¬†*as faculty in 1993.""  (Wikipedia)*

Adding that Professor Schekman won the Nobel Prize for Medicine ~~Chemistry~~ in 2013.

Baker's co-winners this year are Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, both of whom are based in London and currently work for Google DeepMind.  Baker receives 1/2 of the prize money and the other two 1/4 each.

So, the streak of close-but-not-close-enough continues with UC Berkeley and the Nobel Prize this year. **Of the prizes announced so far--Medicine, Physics, and Chemistry--one recipient of each prize has a direct Berkeley connection, but none of the three were on the Berkeley faculty when they won the prize.**

Through college, I have maintained this rigid sleep schedule because I didn't even know people can sleep less than 8 hours and still function. But I've recently been feeling the temptations to sleep less, because I'm strugglin. My grades are in limbo between fire and water, good and bad.

I was looking for a sign from the heavens to let go of that decree for which I once held dear. Then out of nowhere I started seeing all these posts about sleep deprivation. Now I've never tried sleep deprivation before. But I'm reading these warnings and symptoms and honestly it seems managable. I wanna go easy on it because its my first time, but I'm also worried I won't be able to contain myself and Iet loose. I might be a monster, like a beast chained from its inner desires. Also like what if I don't respond well to sleep deprivation, because I know some people get really giddy, moody, or even violent at times. Like what if I fall unconscoius while staying awake for too long, and there is nobody around to resuscitate me. I feel like I'm stuck between the living and the dead.

Berkeley's philosophy game is top notch as well, and they actually had two of, imo, the top six or seven greatest philosophers America has ever produced: John Searle and Judith Butler.

John Searle was very famous back then. He was known for the Chinese Room thought experiment, which we can definitely use right about now with the threat of AI.

Judith Butler was probably the originator of the pronoun/gender phenomenon that has taken over the world.

Just another reminder of how incredibly well-rounded and important your school is.

1fuonut,UCDavis,I Got Stabbed While Ridding the Amtrak Train Back To Uc Davis.,"Hello everyone, just wanted to tell my story for all people using the Amtrak train to get from and to UC Davis. On Sunday September 8th 2024 I was on my way back to UC Davis to take summer class finals when I became a victim of a random act of violence. In less than a second, a stranger sat right next to me on the Amtrak and began to stab me. As I proceeded to fight off my assaulter, they ended up stabbing me once in the lower heart, once in the lungs, two times in my left arm and once in the palm of my right hand. Fortunately, I was able to get past the guy and run towards the conductor's cabin where I proceeded to collapse right at his feet. 

As I was laying there on the ground, fully conscious of the fact that I got stabbed in the chest, i starting hearing again to a cabin full of yells, screams and death threats. while I raised my hands to stop blood from pouring out of the stab wounds I remember instructing this random beast of a UC Davis student to put pressure on my heart to minimize the chance I would bleed out. Fortunately I was only 5-7  minutes away from the Fairfield station but for that small amount of time i remembered fighting for my life trying my best not to go to sleep and calming myself to minimize my heart rate. After a period of time which felt endless due to the pain of having tight pressure placed upon my heart, the police with K9 units came onto the Amtrak and apprehended my attacker. Immediately after, the police took me out of the cabin, carried me down the stairs, lowered me onto a gurney and sent me into the ambulance. 

During the entire time that I was transported from the train car to the cold table of the operating room, I fought to stay awake while constantly thinking of my friends and family only knocking out once the hospital injected me full of drugs. After i woke up from my medically induced coma I had learned that I got stabbed in the lower part of the ventricle which made the doctors have to undertake open heart surgery and transfuse 9 pints of blood into my system. the surgeons told me that If i didn't quickly reacted by fighting back, putting my cuts in the air and having someone put pressure on my heart, i wouldn't be here to type my story.

If you decide to ride the Amtrak train please be alert, go to the conductor if you feel something is awry, sit next to multiple passengers, try to ride with a friend and if something happens get away from danger as soon as possible.

I will probably be updating this text as my hands heal better, I got cut up pretty badly in my right hand and it still hurts to type. in terms of my condition, I just got the last of my staples out from my thorax and the doctors said that my outlook for a full recovery are very high. I am looking forward to joining the campus in the winter once i have fully healed from my stab wounds. Everyone please stay safe as you ride the train and enjoy the fall back.

1de01ur,UCDavis,What you‚Äôre chanting.,"I didn‚Äôt want to have stick my neck out and discuss this issue bc it is such a hot topic. However after watching and hearing the students at UCDavis chant support of Al Qassam I needed to. 

Al Qassam is the armed militant subdivision of Hamas. A known terrorist organization rooted in Palestine both literally with their tunnels and metaphorically. This organization is responsible for the raping,  murders, and oppression of both Palestine and Israel. They are known for being similar to the SS under the n*zi party and for using similar tactics to abuse and torture individuals who don‚Äôt adhere to the Quran. This includes and isn‚Äôt limited to women, gay men, trans individuals, people of color, and members of any other religious faith. They are terrorists.

Chanting your support for a horrific terrorist organization that oppresses not only Israelis but anyone who doesn‚Äôt adhere to their religion is despicable. Every single woman marching in that terrorist parade would have been slaughtered if presented before the organization they are backing. 

If any student after reading how their friends families and loved ones would be tortured under this oppressive regime still support the UCDavis terrorist encampment your scum worth less than the dirt we walk on. 

Gary May please expel these terrorists.

1dcot9i,UCDavis,To the Gaza Protesters at UC Davis.,"I don't think any reasonable person doesn't feel for the cause you're protesting for, but to do so without fear in the place we are is a privilege. Not worrying about your academic future to protest about something you believe in is a privilege. Not worry about being deported if caught in a protest is a privilege. Not having to worry about flunking a quarter because you don't need financial aid is a privilege. Not all of us are able to do what you're doing without a great personal risk being taken for our futures. 

You will say that this is nothing compared to the struggles and genocide that the people of Gaza are facing, and you are right. **But the choice to commit to something that can affect someone this much should lie with that person. Not with you.**

I don't know what you are planning for finals week but DO NOT interrupt final exams, DO NOT block your fellow students access to transportation and  DO NOT disrupt people trying to go about their lives.

We all care deeply about things, whether it be the plight of the Gazan people or a plethora of different issues around the world. Your dedication to show your support and call for change is admirable, and is something that frankly I don't have the strength to do. But please don't alienate those who support you the most by screwing us over at a very stressful, vulnerable time for many students. 

Please stay safe, and take care.

1gkbmo1,UCDavis,"If you‚Äôre a high school lurking on this page, please consider going to community college.","The UC applications are due soon. I understand you‚Äôre worried about not getting into a UC. You don‚Äôt want to go to community college because of the stigma. However, you need to understand one thing: nobody gives a f*ck about you more than yourself. I‚Äôm a PhD student, so I have a solid understanding of how the education curriculum works. 

As someone who did community college during high school, I can guarantee you that it‚Äôs better than the UC. Here are many reasons why:
1. It‚Äôs cheaper. That‚Äôs common sense. There is absolutely no reason for you to add more loans to your life. Sure, the average student loans is 30k, but do you really understand how difficult it is to pay that off? It‚Äôs over 300 a month. If you have a low paying job after graduation, 300 a month is considered a lot! With this job market, I would avoid student loans at all cost.

2. You get a better education at CC. I hate it when the UC students say things like ‚ÄúWe get Harvard professors.‚Äù Let me tell you the truth. UC undergrads barely get professors who graduated from Harvard. Are there Harvard professors? Yes, they do exist at the UC. However, top professors are mostly doing research and mentoring PhD students. It‚Äôs usually PhD students, lecturers, or adjuncts who are teaching. PhD students are generally less experienced than your community college professor. Most of them do not have enough teaching experiences. They hate teaching but are forced to because they need to have their tuition waived. They hate their job. Your CC professors actually applied to get their job whether they hate it or not. 

Lecturers and adjuncts are underpaid, so they also teach at your community college or CSU. Because it‚Äôs the UC level, whoever is your educator doesn‚Äôt care about you like how community college professors do. You‚Äôre on your own, and it can be very challenging for a young adult. In summary, you‚Äôre getting similar education, yet you‚Äôre paying so much more. 

3. The UC is for PhD. It‚Äôs a research institution. As an undergraduate, you do not need to know the same information as a PhD. 

4. No employer asks if you did community college. I finished my associate‚Äôs degree when I was a high school student. Nobody asked me for my AA degree. If you‚Äôre so ashamed of your CC degree, then you can always just mention your 4 year degree. I mean, you‚Äôre not lying since they didn‚Äôt ask if you went to CC, right?

5. You can always transfer to a UC.

6. This is the harsh truth and many people will disagree with me, but in general, UC courses are more difficult. The curriculum are similar in terms of GE courses, but please remember that the UC comprised of mostly top students. However, CC has different types of students (They also have top students as well, but that‚Äôs just one of the groups). At a UC, you‚Äôre fighting with these top students for an A. Although you‚Äôre not directly fighting with them, you are expected to be at the same level as your peers. You‚Äôre being compared with them. Your grades will definitely be lower when you‚Äôre compared with some of the smartest students. I was always a top student during CC but got humbled real quick at the UC level. 

If you want to go to med school, it‚Äôs a smarter idea to go to a CC and do well in your science courses. Medical schools don‚Äôt care about your undergrad university. They just care about what grades you got for your science courses and MCAT scores. Sure, some med schools give extra points to students to go top universities because they understand the rigor of the curriculum. However, you need to understand that a 3.9 GPA at CC is very different from 3.2 at UC. Let‚Äôs say the med school committee gives you extra points at the UC level, it would only be 3.3 or 3.4. That‚Äôs still not as high as the 3.9 at the CC. Think smart and beat the system. 

If you want to go to law school, they only care about your LSAT and GPA. 

PhDs only care about your research experiences and grades (sometimes GRE). You can gain research experiences during your master‚Äôs. 


6. The UCs offer degrees that are generally not practical. Most degrees are theory-based, and that‚Äôs best for PhD students ‚Äî not undergrads. 

7. Your intelligence is not defined by where you go to college. It‚Äôs defined by how you treat people. A true intelligent person doesn‚Äôt need to go tell others about how smart they are. They let their merits define who they are.

1d2x6nj,UCDavis,Dear Fellow Students - The Disgusting Protests Today,"Dear fellow students, 

I am sad to be writing this post but these issues cannot go un-addressed. I was disgusted with the protestors' behavior today. They barged into the library, classrooms and lecture halls yelling horrid things at students and professors. They called us murderers, swine, and other vulgar things. They attacked individual students and professors with their words. They wore their ignorance on their sleeve today. 

As a student who is in full support of the movement to free Palestine this is both appalling and embarrassing. 

You are doing nothing by yelling these harsh words through halls and interrogating students going about their day. I am in support of protesting but this is no longer peaceful and it is attracting the wrong kind of attention. If this continues I am more than sure the university will find a way to shut down the movement and bring us further from our goals of divestment and change. I am calling to you, my fellow students, to dial back your anger and frustration and instead return to peaceful protests that are constructive rather than detrimental. 

Further, this behavior discourages students who are uneducated on the current genocide from participating. Yelling at people, telling them they are going to hell and are murderers, is NOT going to gain any kind of support. People see what you are doing and many decided not to participate today because they disagree with your method of protesting and your violent words.  

While these protests gain attention, it is absolutely RIDICULOUS to yell such things to your fellow students. 

The TAs striking has value, as it effects the university directly. But I am talking to you, my ignorant undergraduate peers. You who have paid your terms tuition already. You who have already directly funded the blood money this university operates upon. You who have two weeks of instruction, yet had months earlier to strike in your classes, and you are just now rising up. You who marched today and relentlessly shamed and yelled horrid things at your peers. Raising your voice with such violence is not only heinous but it is hypocritical and ignorant. You are causing a disturbance without any positive outcome.  

Instead I call upon you to do something helpful. Raise your voice peacefully yet loudly. Donate to organizations if you can. Educate your peers proudly yet politely. DO NOT cease to be in persistent contact with administration over divestment. 

Your voice matters. But use it for the better. 

I understand you are angry, we all are, but expressing this anger at your peers does absolutely NOTHING to aid what we are fighting for. Today's events were embarrassing and juvenile. I hope you all thoroughly reflect on this message and continue to protest but in a more peaceful manner.",-0.83,Politics

Anyways, one female mender of the group ran out to talk to me and asked me what I was doing.
 I explained to her that I was wondering why they had such a blockade and what it would accomplish. She said, by disrupting finals it would make all the students aware that students in Gaza did not get to have the graduation and schooling that we enjoy. I asked if this might alienate students who previously supported their viewpoint against the cause, and she said that it definitely would, but that's the nature of being Palestinian in a Zionist culture. They will be disregarded and disliked. I told her I fundamentally disagreed with how she was going about raising awareness, especially in such a consequential week of school, and she said that it won't be popular but they need to keep Palestine in the front of the public consciousness. 
I appreciate that she was willing to engage in a friendly dialogue, instead of sitting in the shade and laughing. However, this is going to cause a lot of unwarranted stress and tumult in a week where we have enough of that already. I'm grateful to be able to bike to campus as an alternate method, but I know that many other students don't have such an option. I really hope this doesn't bleed into the graduation ceremonies.

Remember, you belong here just as much as anyone else. Stay focused on your goals, and don't let the temporary discomfort of feeling out of place hold you back. Keep in mind that you are on your own in college. You need to help yourself, or no one else will. Keep seeking help when you are struggling.

Around 2:00 -4:00 AM, two of my friends went out for a snack in downtown Davis, where they got jumped by THREE* (still) unidentified individuals, 2 males and one female(Correction made, there was a 4th individual who was not involved in the assault and attempted to intervene). The aggressors pulled towards Nick the Greek , where my friends sat eating. It was during this that one of the aggressors attempted to get the attention of my friends, claiming that ‚Äúthey were staring at them.‚Äù The primary instigator was a  *tall, skinny, middle-eastern man with a buzzcut and a dark or blue tank top* , who came out of the car and attempted to escalate any non-existent problems further. The car was a UPDATED* GREY MAZDA hatchback or SUV looking vehicle (potentially a CX5),  plate starts with 7.* The perpetrator‚Äôs accomplices were also in the vehicle and were also involved in assault. They attempted to chase my friends around and at some point focused on targeting one of my friends. This friend who was assaulted is currently in the ER with a dying phone, so I‚Äôm posting for them in the meantime. Please, if you were there, report what you saw to the cops.

*UPDATE*: There were 3* people, three males and one female. 
The main assailant was wearing a dark or blue tank top. He had short hair (buzzcut). Another one of the suspects had black shirt and raised hair (styled to be up). Both appeared to be adult middle-eastern males. 

*CORRECTION: The 4th individual (male) may have been a bystander, he was attempting to intervene.

1cy795z,UCDavis,UC Davis facing federal lawsuit over pro-Palestinian encampment; student senate passes resolution in solidarity with protesters,"A student who is a disabled veteran filed a lawsuit due to the encampment blocking the sidewalk and allegedly being hit by an umbrella multiple times from people of the encampment. (Allegedly because it hasn‚Äôt been proven)

I will say that I don‚Äôt understand why the encampment is going over the sidewalk. There is tons of space at the quad unless it‚Äôs specifically to impede foot traffic but that seems counter intuitive because it could look bad to block paths used by people who require being able to cross on a flat non grassy surface. 

Also I didn‚Äôt know part of the demands was to abolish the UCPD. 

The complete demand about that is:

‚ÄúThat UCD shall initiate the abolition of the University of California Police Department (UCPD) and Public Safety offices by removing all military equipment possessed or used by these departments, as well as all guns, batons, tasers, and other weapons possessed or used by these departments; that UCD complete a public audit of its use of any and all surveillance technologies, whether physical or digital in form; that UCD end agreements between UCPD, local police forces, California Highway Patrol, and any county sheriff's office; that UCD end current and restrict future collaborations, ‚Äúmutual aid agreements,‚Äù interagency collaborations, and the use of UCPD or any campus resource to serve warrants for outside agencies; that UCD prohibit any engagement, agreement, or cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.‚Äù

I get the last part with enforcing warrants on campus, immigration and customs enforcement but the rest of it doesn‚Äôt seem likely to happen. It sounds like there would be no enforcement of laws or punishment of illegal activities. We already have a problem of sexual harassment and assault that happens way too often. 

It sounds like too once the quarter is over the encampment will leave but ‚ÄúIf their demands are not met, protestors say their demonstration will continue in some form at the start of the fall semester.‚Äù Why not stay after the quarter if you believe in this protest? 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the demands aren‚Äôt met unfortunately because the school just has to ride it out until mid June.",-0.53,Politics

**UPDATE #2**: Someone has made [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1dp9dh5/i_drafted_an_email_in_response_to_the_email_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) concerning email for life and has provided an email letter template if you are so inclined.

**UPDATE #1:** I just test-sent an email to a colleague who lost access to their email a few months back. **There is no bounce-back when sending an email.** Meaning people will continue to send messages to this inactive email without knowing you no longer have access to it.

This is a post for all students but it's most important to recent graduates that may be losing access to their emails after graduating, despite previous promises of ‚ÄúEmail, for life‚Äù.

This is a long post, but if this loss applies to you, we strongly encourage you to read or skim this in its entirety to learn about what the future will look like and what other universities in the University of California System have been offering for years.

**TLDR;** **Alumni undergraduates** will be losing access to their emails **after a 1 year** period after parting with the University due to ***increased costs and security threats*** associated with letting students retain their email address as previously established through ‚ÄúEmail, for life‚Äù. The university may or may not announce this change by email. Further, your email handle that you use to send correspondences to potential employers and/or graduate schools will be changed to ""@[formerstudents.ucdavis.edu](http://formerstudent.ucdavis.edu/)"". **Email forwarding will also no longer be an option.**

The policy will be enacted by the end of this week if there is not enough push back. The policy for this change in ""Email, for life"" was sent to directors and leaders within UC Davis ***who already have established careers*** and may not realize the detrimental effects this could have on students starting their careers after graduating.

**How can you help/What can be done?**¬†

We are writing a letter of appeal to those who have made this decision to end the email retention, and we will be including a list of the reasons. **Please provide any examples on why ending the email will negatively affect alumni (i.e. you) and will reflect poorly on the University**. For a wider perspective, we encourage you to read through the following ways other Universities in the UC System have acknowledged the ‚Äúissues of increased costs and security threats‚Äù, while advocating for and supporting their students, at the bottom of this post.

As graduate students (those pushing this initiative), we are stressed about the possibility of losing my email and the work we have created with it, and also disappointed at the thought of the university clipping the connection between us as a pinnacle of education and their hopeful students. ***Our fight is for the undergraduates who may not yet recognize the value of a secure and legitimate email handle used in their future endeavors at this point in time.***

More details of what is happening and how others in the UC System are handling increased costs and security threats are below:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Email, for Life"" is ending at UC Davis. **Prior to this change, alumni and former staff were able to use their emails after graduation to legitimize themselves to future employers, for networking purposes, and to show pride in being a UC Davis alumni.** The UC Davis website[ here](https://iet.ucdavis.edu/email-service-transition) talks more about why it is being phased out and includes security/privacy risks, and cost as factors. Now, however, they are beginning to phase out (i.e. delete) old emails (active and inactive).

Unfortunately this was not a UC System-wide decision. ***Majority of the UCs do not remove the option of ""Email, for Life"" from people who plan to actively use their UC email handles post-graduation.*** As graduate students, we have had the opportunity to network and collaborate with colleagues within and outside the UC system, and while it would be helpful not to lose access to my email, ***we think it is imperative for undergraduate students moving forward with graduate school and/or into the workforce to have a legitimized means of communication that distinguishes them as affiliates of their school.***

Currently, the only alternative which **UC Davis** is offering is by **purchasing an email through the Alumni Association for $425 for a lifetime membership** (email does not come with the $30 yearly annual subscription). This email will not be the same (ending in ""@[almuni.ucdavis.edu](http://almuni.ucdavis.edu/)"") and will not have the stored emails and data from the original email handle.

In terms of equitability, ***abruptly removing access from ALL students, some of whom want to actively use their emails for their careers, due to concerns of the hypothetical misuse of personal information by a SUBpopulation, within the span of time the University is giving them (1-3 years), IS inequitable***, and this does not seem to have crossed the University's mind.

This is disappointing and we feel a loss of pride being a part of such a prestigious school that has not taking into consideration the negative effects of losing a legitimate email can have on students--specifically undergraduates.

We think an announcement from UC Irvine put it best when discussing their[ continued email support](https://www.oit.uci.edu/2023/05/22/preserving-your-uci-gmail-account-post-graduation/), **""R*****emember, your association with UCI doesn‚Äôt end after graduation. By keeping your UCI Gmail account active, you stay connected with the university community and retain a valuable resource that can serve you well into the future.""***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-

Below is a list of how other universities in the UC System have combated the increased costs and security threats of allowing ""Email, for life"" to continue:

**UC Davis** allows receiving emails at your original ""@[ucdavis.edu](http://ucdavis.edu/)"" but replies will come from ""@[formerstudents.ucdavis.edu](http://formerstudents.ucdavis.edu/)"". Website for learning more about the email transition[ here](https://iet.ucdavis.edu/email-service-transition.).

**UC Merced** provides UC Merced graduates a lifetime membership to their Alumni Association at **no additional cost\*,** and have **""indefinite access""\*** to their email address, as well as gain access to the UC Alumni Career Network ([here](https://alumni.ucmerced.edu/about/ucmaa))

**UC Los Angeles** removes cloud access, but still offers **""Email, for Life"" at no additional cost**,[ here](https://it.ucla.edu/news/graduates-backup-you-pack).

**UC Santa Cruz** removes cloud services, but **continues to allow ""Email, for Life"" to those wanting it** ([here](https://its.ucsc.edu/projects/google-changes-alumni.html)). See quotes from webpage below:

**UC Irvine** allows for annual account renewal ([here](https://www.oit.uci.edu/2023/05/22/preserving-your-uci-gmail-account-post-graduation/)). See quotes from their newsletter below:

**UC San Diego** provides UC San Diego graduates a **lifetime membership** to their Alumni Association at **no additional cost** ([here](https://alumni.ucsd.edu/perks/email-for-life.html#I-am-a-current-staff/faculty-me))

**UC Berkeley overturned their university's decision by showing concern using a petition on change.org. (**[**here**](https://www.change.org/p/don-t-disconnect-us-our-berkeley-edu-email-is-more-than-just-an-address)**)**

**UC Riverside** allows continued use of email as alumni (info provided by u/Familiar_Spite_924)

1hhoogb,UCDavis,Help me find the guy that I‚Äôm slowly starting to forget,"Hi guys, I am so sorry but I need to let this out before I forget. I (F18), am currently attending UC Davis. Last week was finals for us, and I was having an awful day until something changed it. On Wednesday, I decided to finally rent a scooter for the first time and didn‚Äôt think my luck would fail me on that day, but it did. Around noon, I was riding the scooter on campus after finishing my first final when I fell at the intersection between Hunt Hall and the MU. Fun fact, today of all days I wore my puffy white sweater with gray sweatpants and white shoes. Everything was covered in dirt, and I was bleeding profusely on my hands and knees from the impact. My airpods had flown to the ground, and I sat there looking pitiful. I was ready to call it a day, when this guy a literal block away (at the next roundabout) ran to me. Keep in mind, this guy was far enough to ditch me at the ground and go on with his day, but he ran to me instead. He wore glasses and had black fluffy hair. However, the most significant thing I remembered about him was his soft voice. I stood up, dusting dirt off of my sweater, and by the time I went to grab my airpods, he had already beat me to it. I reached out to grab my airpods from his hands, but he stood there and didn‚Äôt give it to me until he made sure I was okay. I was so flustered from his act of kindness and my fall that the memory of our conversation was a blur and I didn‚Äôt even get a good look at his face. I only got to thank him before he ran for it across the street. I‚Äôm guessing he was running late for a final. Take a moment to realize that I‚Äôm writing this story at 11:30pm 7 days after the incident occurred, I‚Äôm desperate. I wish I had talked to him more, but I was so shocked that I was practically frozen on the spot. I‚Äôm slowly forgetting what he looked like, but I only remember his voice. If you‚Äôre reading this, I would like to thank you for what you did that day in person.

I was more than halfway across the road when a girl in (what looked like) a blue mini cooper who was coming out of the parking lot did not stop and hit me with her car. I just got out of the hospital and thankfully I didn‚Äôt sustain any serious injuries just bruising and abrasions. 

Unfortunately, I was in too much shock to get any information from the girl, and when I got up after the accident she got back in her car and left. Firstly, thank you to everyone who stopped to help me and pick up my bike. 

I was wondering though if anyone saw/got the girl‚Äôs license plate. My bike‚Äôs rear tire doesn‚Äôt work anymore and I‚Äôll have to repair or completely replace the bike.

Edit: It was likely more of a light blue/pastel green mini cooper and the girl was caucasian with braids.

This evening, along with Bleu‚Äôs grieving owners and several neighbors who were so kind in helping retrieve his body last Thursday, we started what I‚Äôm sure will be a much-visited memorial on the entry road between Pinecrest and Cranbrook apartments. 

Please look for the second tree in the center grass divider close to the rental office and you‚Äôll see a few photos of the beautiful, sweet boy along with his favorite large carrot toy and some LED candles which we‚Äôll aim to have on each evening. Please add whatever you might wish to place there to commemorate this precious neighborhood icon, who loved everyone whose path he crossed.

1glkrkf,UCDavis,Grieving the Loss of a Pet,"Last night I got home from campus around nine and noticed that my childhood cat Cheeto was laying in my closet. I kind of brushed it off because that‚Äôs something he usually does, but around midnight I went to move him out of my room‚ÄîI picked him up and he felt limp, so I laid him back down and immediately got my parents. He was still conscious and could move all of his legs, but when he did it was uncoordinated and from looking at him he seemed confused. My parents and I decided that we would lay him in my bed for the night to see if he would be better in the morning, trying to give him water by the spoonful. This morning around eleven we had to put him down. He had a stroke sometime last night and decided to hide inside my room. I‚Äôm at a loss for words and have no idea where to go from here.

I signed up for a random roommate for housing and got an incredibly chill dude. We are becoming friends I think and he is always cooking up amazing meals and sharing with me. I think he is/was a chef. Super clean, super cool to talk to. I told him I had my friend coming over for a movie just in conversation, so he bought a bunch of ingredients for salmon and pasta, left detailed notes on how to make it, and went back home for the weekend. It turned out great, I managed not to burn down the kitchen.

Anyone else blessed?

Not sure who needs to hear this, but graduating with a low GPA is not the end of the world","I graduated in 2014 with a BS in Biological Sciences (Emphasis in Molecular and Cellular Biology) and a 2.71gpa. I was pre-dental throughout undergrad, and by the time I reached senior year, I realized that I had done too much damage to my gpa to get into dental school without a post-bac program. I thought that I was screwed career-wise and panic-applied to a ton of biotech/biopharma jobs with no luck. I was able to land a job as a lab tech at UCSF from a post I found on Craigslist (lol). My plan was to take a couple of years to study for the DAT and apply to post-bac programs, but after a year of working at UCSF, I realized that the stress I was putting myself through to try for dental school just wasn‚Äôt worth it. I was eventually able to grab an entry-level role at a large biopharma, which led to a higher paying job at another large biopharma, and ended up with a global product marketing position at a large medical devices company, making more than I thought I ever would with just a BS. I just wanted to share my path for anyone who feels like they have no options due to a low gpa. There are tons of roles in the industry that people just aren‚Äôt aware of, and they offer great pay and work/life balance.

1g7fzsp,UCDavis,MY ROOMMATE WILL NOT STOP REFERENCING/ WATCHING TALK TUAH,"I (18M), and my roommate (18M) have gotten along in our dorm up until this point. But I fear it has gotten to a breaking point. Let me explain because I understand this may seem like an overreaction, considering the podcast is popular at the moment. But when I say he doesnt stop watching it, I mean it. Every waking hour in my room, I hear hear the wretched sound of JoJo Siwa on last week‚Äôs video. He literally LOOPS it for hours on end while hes studying, eating, sleeping, EVERYTHING. It‚Äôs been like this for the last week or two ever since I sent him a stupid tiktok, and he discovered what it was. He even admitted he puts his phone on the ground in the communal dorm bathrooms to watch it. The worst part however, is not the video, for I can tune that out with headphones, but the references when Im just existing around the dorm or around school. Ex) I hear this stupid joke as soon as I walk in the dorm or wake up EVERYDAY, this morning included. It goes like, ‚Äúhawk 1: wheres hawk 3?, hawk 2: uhhh‚Äù and then he sits there and asks if I get it until I say yes, ITS INFURIATING. Last night he said, what if when you pray, you say hawkletuah, instead of hallelujah and I just about blew my brains out. And dont get me started on a few days back when we passed by each other around campus while I was rushing to a class, and he decided it would be best to walk with me and deliver some joke about how his grandma died for 43 minutes and somehow came back to life because of talk tuah, what does that even mean? I finally had enough of this behavior this morning when I was on a phone call with my friend from home (outside the dorm room) and he found me in the lounge, and TOOK my PHONE to play the new episode of talk tuah at full volume + ran away with it. IT RELEASED 3 HOURS AGO. I still dont have my phone back. Im hiding in the lounge. I cannot live like this. How do I approach the subject matter given the strange circumstances?

1hmv834,UCDavis,Action plan for addressing the issues with the UC Davis Financial Aid Office,"**Context**: On December 23, I received a notification from the Financial Aid office informing me that my awards had been modified. Upon reviewing my awards, I discovered that nearly all of them had been either removed or reduced, and 1 new one had been added with an effective date for the upcoming quarter.¬† As a result of these ambiguous modifications, I am now responsible for an additional large fee.

**Settings**: If you have found yourself in a similar situation, please note that such conduct is illegal. As per the Federal Student Aid [website](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/how-can-i-submit-complaint-about-how-my-college-is-administering-my-financial-aid) description, the ""*school violating its own policy or federal regulations in its administration of the federal student aid programs include the following:*

* *Your school calculated your eligibility for federal student grants, loans, or work-study incorrectly.*
* *Your school disbursed (paid out) your aid or your credit balance incorrectly (in the wrong amount, at the wrong time, or not at all).*
* *You have tried to work things out with the school but have been unable to.‚Äù*

**Grounds**: Because this is my [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1hl6t3r/im_just_here_to_say_that_i_hate_the_financial_aid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) about this subject, and because I received multiple DM's from other students who have been exposed to similar unfair treatment by the Financial Aid, I believe that doing nothing and allowing them to continue abusing their positions is no longer an option.¬†

Yes, I believe that this is a misuse of oversight by UC Davis Financial Aid‚Äôs Office, whether voluntarily or not. Regardless of whether this is due to a shortage of staff, insufficient staff training, or any other cause, we, the students, are exposed to severe scrutiny when it comes to handling our payments, and we should demand and expect the same in return.¬†

**Action**: Here are two options that you can use to impact not only your unique financial aid issues but also the entire student body at large.¬†

1. UC Davis Ombuds Services:

As per the description on their page, this is a confidential service *""that considers the interests, concerns, rights, and perspectives of all parties and works in a neutral and unbiased way to help people explore fair and equitable options toward resolution.""* In essence, this service offers a comprehensive understanding of all the resources that are available on our campus and potentially beyond.¬†

Link: [https://ombuds.ucdavis.edu/our-services](https://ombuds.ucdavis.edu/our-services)¬†

1. Federal Student Aid¬†

The complaint can be submitted by either you or a third party, such as your parents. Also, the complaint can be public or anonymous. This is vital in case you are concerned about potential retaliation. I understand that some students, including myself, may be hesitant to overtly take action against such a powerful and insulated department, but this should not be an excuse to remain silent and allow the ongoing mistreatment to continue, especially since we can have our voices be heard discreetly.¬†

Link: [https://studentaid.gov/feedback-center/login/complaint](https://studentaid.gov/feedback-center/login/complaint)

\---

Please note that I‚Äôm not asking you to violate any rules, cause disruptions, or disrespect our university's faculty and staff. Rather, I ask you to take the initiative in addressing our ongoing concerns, thereby ensuring that the UC Davis Financial Aid Office ends the chronic delays, inconsistencies, lack of transparency, and inadequate responses to our legitimate inquiries.¬†

It is only fair that when our university issues awards before each quarter, the acceptance of these awards, the full payment of our dues, and the fulfillment of our academic obligations through satisfactory academic progress ‚Äìensure that any subsequent adjustments do not affect previously granted awards, but rather, only applies to future ones.

1fjnqlx,UCDavis,"Dismissed two years ago, getting ready to be readmitted (hopefully!!)","Just here to vent. I've literally been holding on to this forever. Not even my parents know I got kicked out still to this day. 

Two years ago, I was a 4th year at UC Davis waiting to enter my 5th year. Due to my own stupidity and irresponsibility (I was dealing with other personal things, school was not my priority) I found out that I was dismissed after not checking emails and just kinda going through the motions. I didn't even know dismissal was possible for me. I was an honor roll student in high school, I believed I was very smart. I was ignorant and I did not care about my education enough. I made an appointment to BEG uc davis to take me back. tl;dr they did not take me back and told me i could return after a year. 

This was ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING to me. I thought my life was over, I thought I had to move back home, I thought I could never return to school again. It was so bad I actually started therapy. I had no clue how to dig myself out of this one. I got a fast food job to pay rent since I was riding on my financial aid for 4 years and it suddenly got cut off. My life was miserable, I did not think there was a light at the end of the tunnel.

Fast forward a year, I'm in a better mindset, I want to go back to school, and I'm ready to take my education seriously. I made an appointment with the same advisor who told me I could not return for a year and he was very supportive and actually remembered me. He said my entire attitude changed (a year before this, I violently sobbed in front of this man) and he knew I was actually ready. No one really told me I had to fulfill a few requirements in order to return to uc davis. i wish i knew sooner so that i could have fulfilled them sooner but oh well. I had to bump my gpa up, but due to my financial situation I chose to wait until summer session to take classes.

Now here I am, I took classes in SS1 and SS2 and I'm still waiting for my grade from my SS2 class but I'm 90% sure I already meet the requirements for readmission. I have a couple appointments scheduled for next week (FQ literally starts next wednesday AHHH) and I'm hoping I'm ready to return. I'm really just waiting on this grade to coming out and I have never been so nervous. I have been preparing for 2 years. I dug myself out of a deep depression, started my first job, had numerous advising appointments, studied up on class material from my old classes, everything in my power to prepare for this moment. I'm really hoping I can start next week. I have backup plans just in case something falls through but I'm confident that I will return as a student, whether it's next week or next quarter.

If you got dismissed and are looking into readmission, here's some things that no advisor told me straight up/I had to find out the hard way:

-If you get dismissed and can't readmit for a year, take classes!! You will have readmission requirements and I was not told until I spoke to the advisor a year after my dismissal. Look into open campus so you can still take uc davis classes so it's easier to transfer units

-if you apply for readmission, make sure you already meet/about to meet your readmission requirements. The application to readmit is $70 non-refundable. I submitted the form before I knew about the requirements so my application was denied and I have to submit another one. save your money

-the advisors really want to see you succeed. if they don't, find another advisor. when i was in school no one believed in me and they all told me to switch majors. (maybe they were right since i did get dismissed) but honestly it feels so nice to prove them all wrong. all the advisors i talked to post-dismissal really made me feel like i was wanted and that i deserved to come back

-lastly, check your emails every single day. do not be like me. do not check out for the summer. even if the subject line seems very mundane PLEASE CHECK YOUR EMAIL. i feel like if i just more consistently checked my email these 2 years would not have happened/could have gone smoother

  
and if you want any advice from me, keep going. in the moment, my dismissal was incredibly traumatic. but looking back at the person i was 2 years ago versus now, the dismissal was not only very necessary but could have been one of the best moments of my life. it forced me to slow down, rethink my priorities and why i wanted to attend college, and really taught me how to take care of myself. hopefully i when i update this post i'm a registered uc davis student again for the first time in 2 years.",-0.27,Academics
1cw3kbx,UCDavis,Historical Stories of UCD,"Alright get your marshmallows and gather around the campfire folks, I‚Äôd like to share some important UC Davis history from when I was a student (2014-2018)! You all are benefitting from the struggle of our time back then!

Former students feel free to share some as well!

1. One time there was a massive clusterfuck campus-wide event that happened when Smartsite crashed. Finals were cancelled for literally thousands of students. The finals for 2 of my classes were cancelled and I was able to pass both classes without taking finals and that was hands down the best quarter of my time at UCD. Apparently UCD was no longer renewing their contract with the company in charge of smartsite so the company decided to be petty and didn‚Äôt even try to attempt to fix the massive system error from what I was told. To this day, I believe the otters in the arboretum chewed through the wires and did something to sabotage the system in favor of the student since thousands of us kept typing ‚ÄúSwim on Otto‚Äù on a social media post. It truly works everyone! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

2. One time UCD had to release a campus-wide broadcast stating that the viewpoints of the students do not represent the university at large. This was in response to Chance the Rapper deciding to come and perform a concert at our school for free. One student posted a viral post and told all the non-Black students that they needed to hand over their front row tickets to all the Black students because they weren‚Äôt Black, couldn‚Äôt fully relate to Chance, and couldn‚Äôt identify with the struggle of being Black.

3. The infamous Gary May ‚ÄúFuck them kids‚Äù memes lmao. So there was one time when everything was on fire, various fire departments were putting in double overtime combating the various wildfires in the surrounding areas and the air quality was extremely poor. Like the literal clouds turned orange and the sun was blocked somewhat due to how bad it was and if you walked outside, you would literally be covered in ash and embers from the air. UCD decided to close the campus down for like 2 days to ‚Äúprotect the students‚Äù or whatever. Then Gary made the decision to reopen in the midst of it. There was public backlash not only from thousands of students but from the Davis community at large. Then came the viral ‚Äúfuck them kids‚Äù memes with photos of him photoshopped in news interviews about UCD students. If I remember, he closed the school down for a couple more days in response to the backlash lmao! We all cheered for a well need break from lectures and classes!

4. Dumpling Gate Scandal. So there was a freshman girl in the dorms who became well known for making and selling dumplings to students. She was known as ‚ÄúDumpling Girl‚Äù. This one dude ordered 40 dumplings from her and then ghosted her after she made them. She exposed him and started throwing shade. He became known as ‚ÄúFlake Boy‚Äù. He responded and started throwing shade back at her and mentioned the dumplings at Four Seasons Chinese restaurant were much better! They were going at it back and forth and hundreds of students were instigating them on. Was wild! Four Seasons got a lot of business after that though üò≠

5. Pepper spray incident. This was before my time but there were student protestors at the quad who refused to leave the quad and they were subsequently pepper sprayed by the campus Police. The school was sued for $1 million and each student who was pepper sprayed was granted $30,000 from the settlement. I believe campus police learned from that incident which is why they are currently allowing the Palestine encampment to go on right now.",-0.83,Academics

1h1mrrp,UCDavis,Please help report the PHY 7 series,"This series is completely unacceptable and is below qualification standards this school has for it. They are LYING to the organizations that certify a course for specific standards and to grad schools that use those standards to equate to a student actually taking a year of physics + lab. They don't even have a lab component in them, even if they say they do. Please reach out to the physics department and the WSCUC that does the accreditation for courses here at UC Davis. Reaching out to them will do NO damage or punishment to you in ANYWAY, SHAPE, or FORM. If enough students reach out, we can actually make some change. If you already took this course, you can still reach out to achieve justice on your education and any damages this course has done on your academic career or mental health. If you haven't taken this course, please reach out to fight for a quality education YOU ARE PAYING FOR. This is below what any other UC Campus has on their campuses. I have listed some problems for these courses below. 

1. In the PHY 7 series, they make all first year phd students lead 5 out of 6 hours of the course. This is completely unacceptable. I've taken a lot of summer courses that were taught by PHD students, and they were either in their last year or graduating in a QUARTER or two. A first year PHD student should NEVER be responsible for 5/6 of a student's EDUCATION. Lab is fine, since they barely influence the setting.
2. The 5/6 hours that the TAs lead isn't even ""teaching"". Most of the time it's just you trying to figure out the information from the manual. The TA would only talk to clear things up. There is no ""lecture"" for the 5/6 hours, it's just working with 4/5 other students on problems no one TRULY knows how to solve. You're just hoping what you THINK is right (since the manual always asks what you think the answer is). ALSO, the manual doesn't even share the answers. There are no key or explanations.
3. The tests are NEVER like the information taught. They have the same ""topics"", but the averages in my class were about 50%. I understood all of the information taught and answered the multiple practice tests with EASE, but always got below the average for quizzes. Every single type of problem in the manual, I can do. Every resource this school provides, I know and can do. SO WHY DO THE TESTS NOT REFLECT A STUDENT'S KNOWLEDGE ON THE CLASS. THAT'S THE POINT OF THE TEST.
4. The 7 series incorporates the lab component of the course, however there are barely any lab activities. They were more like short and small demonstrations every now and then. I suspect the school lies about the lab activities when they get their classes certified, because no grad school would ever consider this series as doing ANY lab work.

Nearly all UC Davis professors take attendance so saying that remote class options reduce the need for monthly passes is also bs. I would pay almost $900 a year in parking, which means that 12 parking tickets over the 9 month school year is still cheaper than paying for parking.

I'd like you to tell me why a parking pass isn't even an option for students who commute from far away. Davis is expensive and not all students have the money to live here to take advantage of these ""public transportation"" options. Stop assuming all students live in Davis.

1guss04,UCDavis,Strike This Week!,"[https://www.instagram.com/ucdafscme3299/](https://www.instagram.com/ucdafscme3299/)

Students and student workers, the Union needs you now more than ever! Right now, UC Regents have over $7 billion of our retirement funds invested in Blackstone, a corporate landlord that profits off skyrocketing rent, housing shortages, and evictions.

Blackstone owns 166 student housing properties, making them the largest student housing landlord in the U.S. For example, they own the U apartments. Their business model is driving up rent and debt for students while UC executives earning $500,000+ salaries get access to housing assistance programs. Meanwhile, the UC is doing NOTHING to address the crushing housing costs that are the biggest driver of student debt. This issue affects not only the students living in Davis but also the workers who need to live closer to their place of work.

So, ask yourself:

* What would it mean if UC invested in affordable, social housing for students instead of feeding billions to Blackstone?
* How much could your monthly costs go down if UC prioritized you over corporate greed?

üëâ Right now, career employees‚Äîcooks, food service workers, and dishwashers‚Äîare striking because the UC pays them poverty wages and expects them to do the work of 3 people. These workers are the backbone of campus life, yet they‚Äôre being treated like they don‚Äôt matter.

Yes, there might be limited food options (think fried food and pizza), but let‚Äôs not blame the workers who keep this place running. Instead, make your voice heard:

* Ask UC why they‚Äôll fund mansions for chancellors but won‚Äôt pay fair wages or invest in affordable housing for workers and students.
* Show solidarity with AFSCME 3299‚Äîshare our story, join our picket lines, or even just text UC leadership to demand change.

Together, we can send a clear message: the UC exists because of us‚Äîstudents and workers‚Äînot billionaires and corporate landlords. Let‚Äôs fight for a university that works for everyone, not just the wealthy.

1d882fu,UCDavis,URGENT - GRADUATING STUDENTS GOOGLE DRIVE FILE LOSS,"Hello graduating students,

I'm making this post to let you know the implications of losing our student emails. As some of you might know, our emails get turned into ""@formerstudent.ucdavis.edu"" addresses.  
I assumed this would mean that anything that comes to our student email would be forwarded to these new addresses, but this is not the case as Davis is phasing out forwarding as of April...

I found this out from this old Reddit post from when Davis first announced this ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/14tczu7/end\_of\_email\_for\_life\_email\_forwarding\_for\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/14tczu7/end_of_email_for_life_email_forwarding_for_life/) )

This means 2 things:

1. If you used your Davis email for anything (job sites, career correspondence, etc), any emails that you receive after you lose your email will not be forwarded/end up in the void. You will need to manually update any job sites that you used your Davis email for
2. **You will lose everything / all your work in your Google Drive,** if you don't do the following

Google has a service called Google Takeout, where you can download all your files from your Drive then reupload them to a new Google Drive. This can take anywhere between several hours - a few days to mass export the files, so I would start sooner than later

The easier way of doing this would be to put all your drive files into a folder and then share it to a different gmail and transfer ownership, but when you attempt to do this it will let you know that you cannot transfer ownership to an email that is not a @ [ucdavis.edu](http://ucdavis.edu) address... extremely annoying

The most messed up part? A few years back Davis apparently said we would have our student emails for life.  
They went back on that statement.

To everyone who was compassionate and had kind words for me, thank you. I‚Äôm also really grateful to the ARC staff for their kindness and attention to the matter. 

To everyone that was not so kind (including the person who made the Genshin body pillow post making fun of me), thank you also. Your engagement with the post, however negative, gave it enough attention so that it reached the appropriate party.

I clearly learned an important lesson in being more careful with my belongings, but if anything else can be taken away from this, it‚Äôs that you should always advocate for yourself, no matter how silly or futile it may seem.

This is literally the second time that I‚Äôve had a crime resolved with the help of Reddit. The first instance was a lot more frightening and serious and had a much less satisfying resolution, but it was still resolved because I advocated for myself.

Today during my class at noon protestors walked into the classroom and were making a speech about standing up for Palestinians. During this, a peer threw water onto the protestor giving the speech and threw his metal water bottle (hydro-flask) at the protestor. The whole classroom went silent during this and afterward, some students confronted the person who threw water (and the water bottle). I was wondering what could and should be done in this situation especially because they then began arguing with several classmates and the situation devolved from there. The protestors also took footage/images of them and the class was supposedly recorded. I'm mainly writing this as I'm unsure what's going on, I am also curious if any other students had their classes interrupted during the protest or if similar incidents have occurred around campus. Is this something only isolated to my room? It was a seemingly random outburst I believe, and the entire situation was uncalled for though the protestors did make several rounds of opening the doors and loudly chanting before entering the room. I hope no one else has had similar experiences like this especially as this is the first day of the protest.

1h1kw78,UCDavis,Reporting PHY 009/007? Students shouldn't bank on a curve to pass due to extremely odd teaching methods.,"So many students including myself are STRUGGLING in the physics series. It's gotten me thinking, ""Why is this normalized, like what?"". It is very sad to see so many students, (many of which is their first time taking a physics course entirely) accepting defeat of a course that should not be THAT difficult. I'm pretty sure that the physics series has been terrible for a while now, but I don't think that it should continue to be this way!

  
I should be failing a class due to not understanding the material, not because the teaching method is   
""experimental"" and because the homework is extremely vague. The series makes the MAT and CHE series feel like a cakewalk. I've had multiple certified tutors from the AATC tell me that even they don't know where to start when it comes to the ""homework"" sets. Yet, they expect people who are taking an INTRO class to understand???!

  
I can't imagine how many other students are at odds of failing the course(s) and possibly having to retake 007A/009A or any other course. This has to be somewhat unethical, and definitely should be reported because why not? I surely don't want to be paying real money essentially for a guaranteed failure AND retake. This isn't fair for so many students and should be AT THE VERY LEAST looked into. 

  
I've attached some resources for other students looking to speak up on their perspectives as well. Also, **despite linking these, I believe the best thing to do in order to take action would be to schedule an advising appointment through your major's college (COE, CAES, LANDS, COBS)!!** I feel like having an advisory meeting could possibly help as well to have our voices/opinions heard.

I'm just a student and these link seemed to be the best way to contact an office of sorts. Again, **I believe having an advising appointment would be the best plan**, so be sure to get that scheduled!!

Happy Holidays to everyone! You're not alone, and you will get through the physics series!!!!

Dear Yolo County Probation Department,

My name is **\~FIRST LAST\~**, and I am writing to express my profound grievances over the events associated with criminal case CR2024-2437, The People of the State of California vs. Stanley, Harry Henry. I am particularly concerned with the court's decision to remove Mr. Stanley's Emergency Order of Protection (EPO) initially served by police when Mr. Stanley was taken into custody on July 9th after his wife, Megan Duncanson (Stanley), called 911 to report physical harm inflicted on her by her husband and fear for her life.

As per the Yolo Superior Court online records, the Yolo County District Attorney's Office charged Mr. Stanley with two felony counts: inflicting corporal injury on a spouse and assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury, dating the crimes to Sunday, July 7. Despite these severe charges, Mr. Stanley was released on a $30,000 bail bond and appeared in court for arraignment in the days shortly after. Tragically, Megan was found deceased on July 11th, the same day Mr. Stanley was released on bail. This devastating outcome underscores a grave injustice and a critical failure in the Yolo County probation and judicial process. We firmly believe that Mr. Stanley should not have been released on bail, especially considering the police had records of phone calls from Megan prior to Mr. Stanley's initial arrest, where she explained to officers that he was going to kill her and quietly asked them not to reveal that she was the one who called due to fear of retaliation from her husband. Furthermore, there presumably was a known history of abuse with this couple by the police and the court, and there were serious charges placed against Mr. Stanley.

This letter aims to address our concerns and seek clarification on the procedures and safeguards in place for victims of domestic violence in Yolo County.

A Yolo County Probation Department pretrial assessment report indicated that Mr. Stanley had no prior criminal history and rated him as low risk to reoffend based on a risk assessment evaluation. However, the District Attorney's Office disagreed, labeling Mr. Stanley's conduct as ""extremely concerning"" and highlighting the serious risk of future injury or death to the victim. The DA's Office recommended that Mr. Stanley remain in custody pending a public hearing. Nonetheless, Judge Catherine Hohenwarter signed and served Mr. Stanley with a criminal no-harassment protective order, permitting him to resume contact with Megan.

Furthermore, probation officers contacted the victim, Megan Duncanson (Stanley), who reportedly stated she was not in fear for her safety and did not object to Mr. Stanley's release. She also expressed a desire for the EPO to be removed, claiming the incident was a misunderstanding. Despite this newfound desire by the victim to rescind the EPO, it was completely irresponsible for the Yolo County Probation Department and Judge Catherine Hohenwarter to release Mr. Stanley on bail and rescind the EPO without further due diligence to ensure the victim's safety. It is widely known that domestic violence victims are often coerced, manipulated, and threatened by their perpetrators into silence, forcing them to understate the severity of the abuse they are enduring. This factor should have been given significant consideration in the decision to release Mr. Stanley on bail.

We seek to understand whether the Yolo County Probation Department has any specific safeguards for victims of domestic violence when their perpetrators are released on bail or parole. Additionally, we inquire if there are emergency housing and support services offered to victims like Megan, empowering them to accept help when they are threatened and in fear of their safety. Are there measures within Yolo County, such as more intensive supervision of abusers and rigorous monitoring of mandated batterer intervention programs, that could have been implemented to protect Megan and potentially save lives and prevent future tragedies?

We implore the Yolo County Probation Department to review and enhance its protocols to better protect victims of domestic violence. Better measures must be taken to ensure that other victims receive the protection and support they desperately need. We also urge the department and the court to take matters of domestic violence more seriously in the future to prevent such irreversible consequences.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Source text: https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/resources/employment-policies-contracts/negotiation-updates/uaw-news-and-updates/
  

June 7 Media Contact: media@ucop.edu 
  
A Superior Court judge today granted a temporary restraining order to the University of California, temporarily halting the illegal systemwide strike by UAW-represented employees across campuses.
  
The action comes after UC filed a lawsuit and requested injunctive relief Tuesday against UAW for breach of contract. UC and UAW have collective bargaining agreements that each have no-strike clauses. UAW-represented UC employees began striking on May 20 at UC Santa Cruz and the strike has expanded to six of the 10 systemwide campuses.
  
‚ÄúWe are extremely grateful for a pause in this strike so our students can complete their academic studies. The strike would have caused irreversible setbacks to students‚Äô academic achievements and may have stalled critical research projects in the final quarter,‚Äù said Melissa Matella, associate vice president for Systemwide Labor Relations.
  
‚ÄúFrom the beginning, we have stated this strike was illegal and a violation of our contracts‚Äô mutually agreed upon no-strike clauses,‚Äù Matella added. ‚ÄúWe respect the advocacy and progressive action towards issues that matter to our community and our community‚Äôs right to engage in lawful free speech activities ‚Äî activities that continue to occur across the system. However, UAW‚Äôs strike is unrelated to employment terms, violates the parties‚Äô agreements, and runs contrary to established labor principles.‚Äù While this is an important victory critical to support student success, the University will continue to pursue its legal claims in state court and PERB to protect labor peace across the system.",-0.33,Politics

1d328th,UCDavis,To those who want to protest.,"I want to start by making my stance as clear as possible.  If you disagree, that is okay, I only ask that you either read what I have to say and engage in discussion, or click away, it‚Äôs entirely your choice.

Firstly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has a long history that must be looked at in its entirety.  Focusing on the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas as a starting point is ignorant of this fact.

I believe:
- The ongoing actions by the Israeli government to invade Palestine is wrong.
- The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas was wrong.
- The death of civilians is wrong.
- The targeted bombings of schools and hospitals is wrong.
- Anti-Semitism, showing hostility or prejudice against Jewish people, is wrong. 
- Criticizing Zionism/the State of Israel is not Anti-Semitic.
- Calling for a ceasefire is not anti-Semitic.
- Being in solidarity with the Palestinian people is neither anti-Semitic nor pro-Hamas.
- There should be an immediate ceasefire.

With that out of the way, I want to address those currently protesting and those who may want to.  Protesting, especially in groups, can be a powerful way to deliver a message.  Having partaken in some myself, I applaud those who have been vocal.  However, effective protests must keep certain things in mind.  Some of the posts I‚Äôve seen on here have encouraged me to make this post so that those who want change enacted have a clear idea of how to go about it.

Protests do two things: raise awareness and point the lens at those in power.  They should encourage your peers to stand up and march with you.  Belittling others and disrupting midterms/studying only jades people to your cause.  Rather, educate your peers, extend a hand, march together as equals toward a common goal.  Attention should be focused on faculty and especially administrators who have a platform.

A protest I like to hold up as an example is the march on Washington.  By marching peacefully, and as one, they gained the attention of everyone who may have been less aware or on the fence about civil rights issues.  By marching to the capitol, they brought the scope of the issue directly onto those that had the real power to make the change they wanted.  While protests are disruptive and are meant to be, they should inconvenience your target audience the most.

I believe many of us at Davis agree on things happening right now.  We should uplift our fellow students and focus our voices on the administration, the ones in power.  If you notice someone acting out of line, remind them of what it is they‚Äôre trying to accomplish.  I truly believe in the ability of Davis students to make a change.

tl;dr: we need to uplift fellow students and aim our voices of protest loudest at those in charge.",-0.14,Politics

I have been living in a car on and off, fighting to make it since I graduated.

1e56ipx,UCDavis,Pint the Wonder Dog (former UC Davis football and Vet School live mascot) has passed away,"[https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/news/pint-uc-davis-beloved-wonder-dog-passes-away](https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/news/pint-uc-davis-beloved-wonder-dog-passes-away)

Pint entertained -- and educated -- a generation of Aggie Football fans, often eliciting the biggest cheer of anyone on the field. His omnipresence at football games caused him to [make the rounds on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/70vh4p/another_good_boy_pint_the_uc_davis_dog_has_been/) and there are even [some bobbleheads of him](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/qtj3x1/make_the_pint_bobblehead_be_available_in_the/) out there for those who were lucky enough to attend his retirement game. He was the only other animal on campus to approach Cheeto levels of fame and served as an excellent ambassador between Aggie sports and the campus's world-class science programs.

As mentioned in the article, Cori The Rocket Dog has taken over kick tee-retrieving duties since Pint's retirement and you'll likely see her out on the field this fall. Pint contributed to some research of sorts specifically in this field when it was noticed his teeth were getting worn down by the kick tees -- accordingly, we might expect a more frequent rotation of tee-retrieving canines in future years.

Thanks Pint for the memories!

1hl6t3r,UCDavis,I'm just here to say that I hate the Financial Aid Office with passion,"Every fkn quarter since I first transferred, and I mean EVERY quarter, they have consistently made errors of all kinds. It's like a circus city!! Some of them are so absurd that I'm embarrassed for them to even disclose them publicly.

The entire MyBill looks like a *hieroglyphs* word salad.  
At the start of the fall quarter, there was a certain number of charges and credits. It stayed like that for almost the entire quarter.  So then, last fall they decided to give me toward the end of the quarter (I didn't ask for\*) a small Middle-Class Award. That's nice, thank you.  BUT now an hour ago, they changed almost all my awards. They took off some away, added 1 new one, reduced some others, and then out of the blue, they decided that based on my ""new awards"" I now owe them $2,500.00 for the fall term balance. So they have now added that new charge to my winter quarter.  
WTF!

Yes, I did write to ""the expert""

But let me tell you about the so-called experts. I have found myself every quarter corresponding with them back and forth, asking questions, not getting any fucking straight answers, calling them 626622 times, being put on hold, with my calls being transferred to several people and everyone giving me a different answer, and never getting straight answers... **It is infuriating!**

Who really works in these damn offices? Do these people read the string of correspondence to keep track of what has already been said? If this was a company, those people would be sent back to get additional training.

It's not fair that on December 23, a day before Christmas, I got a fucking brand new term charge for the fall quarter for $2,500.00 when I was already evened out with a $0 balance until yesterday -- and with ZERO explanation. I HATE THEM.

Think whatever you want. Hate me all you like. It ruined my fucking Christmas.

End of Rant (grrrrr...).

EDIT: After researching various options, I found that you can file a complaint directly to the government website. As per their description:

***""Examples of a school violating its own policy or federal regulations in its administration of the federal student aid programs include the following:***

* ***Your school calculated your eligibility for federal student grants, loans, or¬†work-study¬†incorrectly.***

I understand the guy tries to be cool but sometimes he crosses the line with everyone.

But this guy asked me what‚Äôs up with the ladies and casually asked if my gf was the ‚Äúfat one‚Äù using his hands to describe her. I found it oddly disturbing considering it was mean and wasn‚Äôt true at all. He often talks to me but I awkwardly just smile and nod even tho I don‚Äôt sometimes don‚Äôt understand the stuff he says ngl.

1fvmyps,UCDavis,RESPECT THE RULES OF THE ROAD,"Today there was one thing happened that almost drew me in to troubles. I was riding scooter near east quad and when I decided to pass the roundabout, a random woman suddenly crossed the street with her head facing on the other side of the road. She did not see me coming and it was me realizing this sudden situation and did emergency handbrake. This action nearly drew me out of the scooter. Fortunately I kept my balance so I did not crash on the ground with my face. That rider, however, just went away as nothing happened, leaving me scared and mad.

I understand that people need to rush for their busy quarter, but please, DO OBEY THE RULES OF THE ROAD. When you see a stop sign, STOP. When you see a yield sign, YIELD. When you want to cross the street, please look around to make sure there are no vehicles approaching. When you want to make a turn, DO HAND SIGNS. It is for one‚Äôs OWN GOOD to obey these basic rules. Remember that you will get no hurt if you get to the class a little bit late, BUT YOU MAY if you violated these rules and rush in the street like a Chevy on I80.

Sometimes these troubles caused by violation of these simple rules do trouble me and put everyone at risk. Please, be responsible. Remember that you are riding a bike, not Corvettes or AMGs like those in the ARC parking lot. You are riding a scooter, not a Ducati or Kawasaki! You are riding on a public road, not riding in your kitchen or on Daytona tracks!  Your body is made of flesh, not Orasaka‚Äôs cyberkits! Remember that even though you are muscular, tough, or else, disrespecting rules would ruin everything in seconds. 

Therefore RESPECT the rules and do the best you could do. It is indeed sarcastic to restate these kindergarten rules to university students like us. Respecting the rules is paying responsibility to not only OTHERS on the road, but also YOURSELF: Parents would not want to see their sons and daughters badly wounded due to a mistake on kindergarten rules!

After we both made our turns we ended up both waiting to turn left at the light. Then all of a sudden they reverse a whole car's length back and cross the solid white line to make a right turn? In doing so they dragged my entire bike back with them and made me fall without even noticing me. They didn't even reverse slowly, they applied the gas when they reversed so I had no time to react. I did however get up in time to take a picture of their plate, that being said there was no witnesses besides myself. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that it was dark and raining but the negligence is crazy. If you think about it more, them making the u-turn at the start means they did the wrong turn in that same intersection. üò≠

1en150a,UCDavis,A guide on how to (potentially) survive your first year at UC Davis,"So with the coming school year fast approaching I feel like I want to give incoming Freshmen a head start on how to ""survive"" their first year at Davis. I will say now that I am no way of saying you should follow what I have to say to the T and that these are just what I believe what newcomers may expect and how to handle University.

**Money/Expenses**

Ok so a majority of students nowadays are really worried about money so i'll start with that first. Ill first start off by saying that if you don't have that much money to pay for the year then **ITS OK TO TAKE OUT LOANS.** Granted its best to avoid them whenever possible but when push comes to shove and you're struggling to pay tuition then by all means get loans specifically University and Subsidized loans since those covers loan interest rates up until you graduate or drop out of university and have a 6 month grace period, so you will be able to work it off if you decide to work part time in the University. 

Ill first warn Freshmen that a lot of places especially Downtown Davis particularly run on Credit/Debit card payments but a good amount of them do tend to run on physical cash especially at the Market. In order to save money, you guys have to realize that buying let alone paying for goods and services in Downtown Davis especially is a luxury. Everything there while not crazy expensive is still pricey (especially that cookie place which I personally thing is overrated and overpriced) and will take a toll on your wallet. 

I'm not saying to avoid going and paying all together but make a plan and keep track of your expenses in a sheets document. You can also apply for a job working at Davis to cover the cost of tuition and Loans (Job salary ranges from 16 to even 20\~ Dollars an hour varying on job type) However hours are limiting to 19.5 hours a week as a part time student working on campus since any more than 20 then the University will have to add health benefits and a handful of labor laws or overtime pay requirements. 

There is also quite a bit homeless in Downtown Davis and also a good amount of people who ask for money (My first experience with this was when I was going to Trader Joe's in the fall and was stopped to donate to a children's sports clothing i think, gave them around 20 dollars and then later a group of men at the silo bus stop who sells CD's but I declined it, although both of these instances the guys tend to be really good people to talk to). If you feel like you can spare them a dollar or two to their cause I won't even be mad at you it's fine, it's your money but remember your in college and money is just as important to you as it is to them. It may be selfish but take it from me, **IT'S OK TO BE SELFISH** once in a while if it means you get to use that money to benefit yourself. Just know that you're also struggling for money so focus on yourself before others if you want to get ahead or stay on track with college. What I'm saying is selfish, but it is what it is.

**Schedule**

So, I may be a little late for this, but a good schedule is critical when planning for your first quarters in the year. Each individual student is given a pass time 1 and a pass time 2, for pass time 1 the limit is 17 Units with the minimum of 12 to get the full financial aid package with Pass time 2 used to make quick adjustments or add more classes up to 19 units with maximum you can take in open hours afterwards is 28.5 units. I recommend you take 15 Units per quarter your first years with classes being no later than 11AM since that will be manageable to get the feel on how your class structure will be. To decide what classes to take go to My Degree on the UC Davis page to see the requirements you need to graduate and or go to reddit (a good plug in) and see what classes are recommended. I would like to make sure that not all classes will be easy, this is a University and Difficulty is a given with any class you choose. This is also a good segway to say that not all classes will be open for registration and will most likely put you on a waiting list. If the list is low and your around the top 5 people then go for it but make sure you have a backup class to fill in the units if no spots are open right when classes start.

**Food and Drinks**

OK, I love food as much as the next person I come across, so it's important to understand that this is very much important in Davis. If you already living in the dorms then you most likely have signed up for a meal plan which will save you a lot of headaches. You can use your meal plan as much as you like at any DC over the days its available since its unlimited and a plus is that you can go get a hydro flask and save on beverages by going over to the fountain drinks and filling it up (IDK if that's aloud but hey no one has stopped me or others from doing this so its aloud as far as I'm aware). They also have a coffee machine, so there should be (practically) no reason you should buy yourself a coffee maker or Starbucks.

If, however, you don't have a meal plan or are tired of the food provided by the Dining Commons, then I have made a small list that can help:

* There's an AMPM right next to Cuarto DC that offers .99 cent on refills for a XXL cup that you can use as many times as you like as long as you showed it to the cashier beforehand.
* There are Residential Markets that you can spend aggie cash at (only for people who have a meal plan). you get $200 aggie cash that can be used at any markets (which itself have different variety of foods and beverages)
* There is both a Target and a Trader Joe's, both of which have cheap variety of foods that you can prepare yourselves in the kitchen (Target for Eggs, Candy, Frozen food and seasoning, Trader Joe's for Meat, Fish and Oil, etc) Fruit, Milk, beverages, and ice cream are already provided at the DC and/or Residential Markets.
* A small list of cheap food items around Davis: Little Creasers (pizza), Pink Dozen (Donuts and Croissants), Open Rice Kitchen (Asian foods), Jack in The Box (Tacos and yes Burgers as an ok alternative), In N Out (Burgers and Fries)
* Bonus: Raising Cane's (Chicken and I consider this a luxury item just for how expensive it is compared to the portion size)

**Fraternity/Sorority**

This topic I'm not too sure of myself since I'm not one for Greek life but there are a few friends that I know who have been with or are in a Fraternity or Sorority. I'll be the first to say that I was shockingly surprised to find out that Sororities have more obligations than frats (Like to the point where I compared it to a cult that's how bad I thought it sounded like imo) no joke a girl buddy of mine says that you are judged by how much wealth you have and how well you adhere to what you have been told.

Surprisingly enough male Fraternities sounded a lot more tamed than the Sororities. All I have heard were good things about a majority of frats (Except for like 2 for some reason but I don't know their names) A good place to start is to take part in rush and see for yourself. As far as I'm aware it's just trials to get a feel for the frats like asking out a girl to a frat or getting blind folded in the dark??? (my friend's words not mine and it may vary from frat to frat).

If you want my two cents then I would check them out yourselves to get the feel for the Fraternity/Sorority. They are a good way to meet new people, and you may benefit from it, but please do be safe and possibly bring a roommate or a close friend you know just to be on the safe side.

**Relationships**

Good luck

**Jobs/Work**

As stated previously having a job is a benefit to you when going to university since your making money while studying at the university. Thats being said you don't necessarily need to have a job, It will help you greatly to get one but some people will be overwhelmed balancing work and studying, so do think twice before coming to that decision and getting a job. I recommend people who do decide to get a job to look through Handshake for any on campus jobs due to them being very flexible and genuinely great hours. Other than that, LinkedIn as well as in person drop off resumes with availability hours at any help wanted places in Downtown Davis will help.

You may want to send out your Job application to wherever you choose to work earlier by ill say 1-2 Months before the start of classes since the process is pretty slow and takes months to get a response back. Always choose more than one job you are qualified for to have the best possible chance of getting hired (If you get more than one job application accepted, then choose the one you think will benefit you more, its ok to reject and accepting application so don't worry too much on that) If you do get a job, bring your state issued ID and SSN Card or birth certificate to show proof of individual identity during the hiring process to be hired and be on record.

**Clubs**

Clubs in itself are just a way on meeting new people and having a group of buddies to be with to cool off from the classes at Davis (like Fraternity/Sorority but without the drinking, occasionally). A club that I recommend is DAC (Davis Anime Club) Where people usually go there to socialize about anything anime, have fun at little events, and go to various places to just have fun as a group (and watch anime during club hours of course). In short join a club only if you have time to go to it, there are tons of clubs at Davis that may be of interest for you.

**Final recommendations**

* Don't bring coffee maker, too many cloths, bed mattress, or too many of one particular item.
* Do bring an extra pair of shoes, rain boots, Umbrella, medical kits, warm blankets, and Pillows
* You can potentially sell some of your personal items on Facebook Marketplace, but it will take some time to sell.
* Yes, people do wear revealing clothing during parties and holiday events (Including the men).
* No, it is not safe for anyone to walk at Davis at pitch black night, have a buddy system especially for women.
* Yes, all nighters are as harrowing as it is and no it does not get easier and no you don't build a resistance to it by normal means, avoid it whenever possible.
* Make time to exercise, trust me your future self and immune system will thank me later.

Remember, all of this is optional to follow and I'm just stating that I think might be important for Freshmen to know coming into Davis. If anyone has any other recommendations for Freshmen then by all means type them out in the comments. Hope you all have a splendid time at UC Davis!

1enpb00,UCDavis,justice for Megan üíô: summary of todays hearing for Harry Stanley 8/8,"hi everyone! i want to thank all those that supported Megan today. whether it was tuning into the livestream of the hearing, showing up in person, or sharing her story and word of the hearing; it is all extremely appreciated. 

here‚Äôs a summary of what we went over today for those who couldn‚Äôt be there. i want to preface this by saying im not any sort of legal expert and the information i have is interpreted to the best of my ability. i also want to mention that some of the details of todays hearing were very upsetting and graphic, if you‚Äôre especially sensitive to descriptions of domestic violence i recommend not reading further. 

the hearing began with a witness called by Megan‚Äôs family‚Äôs lawyer. this witness was the 911 dispatcher that answered Megan‚Äôs call on 7/9. they played the call in court, which began with her whispering for help and saying ‚Äúmy husband is GOING to kill me.‚Äù the 911 operator couldn‚Äôt properly hear her and asked to move to the rapid text line in order to keep her speaking to the police underwraps while still gathering information about the situation. 

in the text logs that go on for 13 minutes (the call was one minute for a total of 14 minutes where she spoke with the dispatcher) she repeats that her husband Harry Stanley is going to kill her, she states she can‚Äôt remember his date of birth because she had been concussed from him hitting her, and begs the dispatcher to not tell Harry she was the one who called. she also tells the dispatcher that Harry said she‚Äôs a ‚Äúvile worm that deserves to die.‚Äù additionally, she mentions the beatings had been going on for multiple days.

witness two was the arriving officer on scene. upon arrival and knocking on the door, Megan ran out of the side yard into the front yard, crying. when Harry finally answered the officer at the door, he claimed that although they were fighting that everything was fine. he declined to let the officer in, where he was then placed in handcuffs while the officer checked the residence. 

the officer found Megan crying in the fetal position on the side of the yard. she immediately put her hands around her neck motioning to strangulation and said once again that her husband was going to kill her. she was especially afraid that Harry would find out she was the one that called police and the officer noted her constantly checking her surroundings, seemingly for Harry, as she spoke to him. Megan told the officer that 2 days prior (7/7) her husband had hit her on both her left and right arms, leaving multiple bruises. she also said Harry told her he was going to ‚Äúbeat her to death.‚Äù she said his explanation for the anger towards her was she ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt acting like his real wife.‚Äù she told the officer she was submissive and would take the abuse. 

the officer found out through Megan that the abuse had been psychological for years, and had just became physical in the past year. Harry also had strangled her the morning prior (7/8), she said she hadn‚Äôt lost consciousness this time, but had when he strangled her in the past. on top of the bruising on her arms, she had bruising on her legs and swelling that made it hard for her to walk. she declined to show these injuries to police because she was embarrassed of what he had done to her. Megan told the officer she was going to die if she stayed in the house, and that she believed he was going to kill her and himself. 

when fire/paramedics showed up at the scene to treat Megan, and while this officer spoke to them, Megan ran back into the house and apologized to Harry for calling the police. when questioned by police, Harry claimed they had fights that were intense and emotional, but tried to say that it never got physical, he was then arrested. 

Megan was taken to the hospital where she was treated and spoke to a domestic violence advocate. when this same officer spoke to Megan in the ER room and told her that Harry was arrested, Megan immediately retracted all her statements, saying police weren‚Äôt allowed to use them in reports, and refused to have any pictures taken of her injuries. she said she was confused and delusional, and that she was now thinking straight. although she didn‚Äôt ask for one, an EPO was put in place for her. 

since no photos were taken of her injuries because of her decline to do so, the court was shown a photo of Megan from the officers body cam. her arms are seen to be very bruised. the officer made note that they were even more colored by bruising in person, and that the image didn‚Äôt show the full extent. he mentioned the bruises up her arms were different colors, stating the likelihood of abuse over multiple days, creating bruises that were in different healing stages. 

his defense is trying to fight from the angle that her wounds weren‚Äôt significant enough. Harry‚Äôs lawyer said ‚Äúall we have is bruising,‚Äù and ‚Äúa lack of cuts or weapons.‚Äù (i personally don‚Äôt like this statement or framing. it‚Äôs completely dismissive of a majority of domestic violence victims, abuse is abuse no matter how severe). additionally, his lawyer claimed that since she never outwardly said the words ‚Äúi‚Äôm afraid,‚Äù that she must have not had any fear towards Harry. this was overruled by the judge, who said the 911 call and way she spoke about Harry to police is sufficient evidence of fear. 

the court confirmed that they have not received any official paperwork from the coroner, there has only been verbal confirmations about the cause of death being suicide. the investigation at the Davis police department is apparently still an open one, and from what i understand, they will continue to look into Megan‚Äôs death. 

i don‚Äôt fully understand the charges they are considering, since when discussing this they used number codes. it‚Äôs my understanding that he is still being charged with the original domestic violence charges, and POSSIBLY an attempted murder charge (don‚Äôt quote me on this, they mentioned code 187 at the end, but i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this is official or just in discussion). bail was once again argued for Harry, which the judge declined. the next hearing will be august 22 at 9am in department 7 at the YOLO county superior court house.",-0.83,Politics

There are four rules to follow as a biker/scooter

1) NEVER bike with both ears covered with headphones in. I cannot stress this enough. YOUR safety is important. 

2) USE your signals when turning! To turn right, extend your right hand, and to turn left, extend your left hand. 

3) the person in the roundabout has the RIGHT of way. YOU yield to them. If you are going straight and you enter a roundabout, stay on the right/middle side so you don't collide with someone turning left.

4) Treat bikes like cars. The left lane is for passing/ fast lane except when turning. 

  
Walkers

There are four rules to follow as walkers

1) NEVER walk with both ears covered with headphones in.

2) When crossing the road and if you see a bike, DONT stop. The bikers have probably predicted your move and will 9/10 go around you. 

3) LOOK BOTH ways before crossing the street. 

4) DONT WALK ON THE ROAD. Guys sidewalks exist.

1hb72ie,UCDavis,PSA: stop accepting scam research positions via email,"i‚Äôve encountered 3 different freshman/transfer students these last two weeks who were all victims of ucd‚Äôs most research assistant scam up to the point of bank involvement, so here‚Äôs how to spot a scam:

- the email sender DOES NOT have a @ucdavis.edu email address
- the sender prefers to communicates over text
- they offer payment before you begin working
- they offer to deposit a check into your account
- they require you to send some of the check money back

things to know:
- all paid research positions via the university are compensated through UCPATH, uc davis‚Äô payroll system. not a random check from a phone number.
- the check they deposit into your account is more often than not, FRAUDULENT
- in most banks, a fraudulent check is enough for them to close your account, even if all you did was accept it (source: 1 of 3 students had their Bank of America account closed. 2 of 3 students are currently contacting their bank/credit union to see if there‚Äôs a fix)
- a researcher will rarely reach out to you like this via email UNLESS, you‚Äôve previously established a relationship via taking their class, a TA, job fair, etc.

‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

looking for a REAL internship or research position? sure, apply via Handshake. but most importantly: 
- network network network
- establish relationships with your professors, TAs, grad students, other student researchers
- go to job/career fairs, research fairs (undergraduate research conference is this upcoming April)
- reach out to professor-researchers at davis and book an appointment with them to ask about their research (don‚Äôt send mass emails to professors asking for a position, ask for a meeting, learn about them &amp; their work, then potentially ask for an opportunity)
- sign up for club newsletters, college/department newsletters, email listservs, etc

If you're in the middle of crossing the street/bike path, and you see a bike coming towards you, DO NOT STOP WALKING.

I get that sometimes you panic and freeze but the best option is to finish crossing if you have already started. It's FAR more likely that we will hit you if you unexpectedly stop right in front of us. Just continue walking and don't make unexpected movements or hesitations, we will just pass behind you. 

As a cyclist on campus i've come very close to hitting people who are crossing in front of me and decide to suddenly stop in the middle of the road to let me pass. Please don't do that, it makes us panic and we will most likely hit you or come very close to hitting you.

To whom it may concern,¬†

Upon hearing the cancellation of the ""Email for Life"" policy, I must say I am distressed. Especially¬†given that other UCs are still allowing their alumni to have access to their accounts. The¬†[ucdavis.edu](http://ucdavis.edu/) email handle is such an important part of a UC Davis student's life and identity.

Not to mention the fact that this email account contains¬†important communications we have built over the years as well as our assignments within google drive. I understand that undergrads will receive a new former students email, but only for a year and after that everything is gone.

Secondly, and perhaps this is a more sentimental assertion, but many students including myself have truly enjoyed our time at UC Davis and it is a large part of our identity. We have given a great deal of time, money, and our souls into the work we have done here at the university and to be cut off from our association with the college in this way is a rather painful send-off. Please take into account the many feelings of the students and reconsider this new policy.¬†

1hpcyy9,UCDavis,Housing scam in Davis,"TL,DR: If you ever get an offer of sharing an apartment with a 'sorta racist old lady with 3 dogs who talks too much', DON'T say yes even if the price is the most reasonable one possible. She'll also tell you that if you help her out with her dogs, she'll give you a discount. I paid with my mental peace and a lot of money :( 

Her usual targets are internationals (or, US citizens who she thinks are internationals because of their ethnicity). 

#awareness #housing_scam
#reason for posting: to save new people from becoming victims.

Hello, 

I have experienced a weird but not new housing scam in Davis not long ago. I was looking for a room with private bathroom in a reasonable price and was approached by an old lady in roomies.com. I initially thought that she owned an apartment and looking for tenants  at least from the way she spoke. I went to see the room, and as the person exists and the apartment exists, I thought it was legit. So, I gave her two months of rent+ security deposit (3000 dollars). However, just before I moved in, she asked me to apply to a new housing with her (along with two other girls). She won't return my money if I backed up at that point and I had not secured any other housing. So, I had to go along with it.

The lease was not an individual lease and if one person does not pay rent, they hold everyone responsible. If everyone paid the rent properly it shouldn‚Äôt be a nightmare story for me. After signing the lease, one of my friends told me that their friend from three years ago was scammed by this person and the friend lost a lot of money and belongings. That time, the old lady was leasing from someone else and leased the apt to others pretending to be the owner. And she probably was sued by the original apt owner. I tried being as careful with submitting rents as I could. I always submitted my rent to the leasing office, however my other apt mates probably gave her the money. She would always wait for last minute and gave 8+ bad checks to the housing over a period of 4 months. So, at the point when she owed the housing 10000+ dollars, the housing started sending notices (to everyone's name in the lease). At this point the housing would not let anyone get out of the lease unless the due is paid. Fastforward: I waa able to get out of the lease in two months from this. The old lady still owes me money. 

The friend who was scammed by the old lady before had told me that the old lady happens to return money if you're pushy enough. I had been consistently pushy but she still owes me a couple hundred dollars. She changes her cellphone numbers and emails every couple of months so it's difficult to catch a hold of her. 

If you ever get an offer of sharing an apartment with a 'sorta racist old lady with 3 dogs who talks too much', DON'T say yes even if the price is the most reasonable one possible. I paid with my mental peace and a lot of money :( 

A girl had emailed me about sharing apt with her while I was living in that apt,.I told her not to give the old lady any money. But the old lady somehow convinced her to give 3500 dollars before moving in and Didn't return the money even when she cancelled moving in. The girl got ghosted by the old lady. The old lady ghosted the girl. There should be a huge number of people who got scammed by her.",-0.93,Finance

I just wanted to let you know that as a low income student trying my absolute best to be successful so I can get my foot in the door in my industry this was a huge compliment and I am so sorry I did not have my rate sheet with me. So for feet picks of me wearing socks its just $5 for 5 photos and for bare foot photos its $10 for 2 photos. For custom work such as stepping on fruit it depends on the type of fruit and freshness of the fruit. So for example, If you want me to step on a cucumber thats just gonna be $25  per photo but for something more messy like an over ripe banana thatll get in between my toes that will run you $50 unless of course you buy in bulk then we can discuss rates based on fruit type and quantity of photos.

1fqsd9q,UCDavis,For all my freshmen and sophomore. Personal tips on how to be successful as a college student that your advisor doesn't tell you.,"1. You were probably one of the stop students in your high school, but the reality is that you are nobody special at UC Davis. There will be people out there who are smarter than you. There will be people who are more prepared and academically challenged. And, that is okay. Don't compare yourself too much to others. The reality is that nobody is perfect in this world, and there will always be somebody better than you. Accept it and focus on yourself only. Focus on being more knowledgeable than who you were yesterday. 

2. Exchange contacts with your classmates. These people are the ones who will help you do well. Trust me, I hated people, but I realized that I will always need people no matter where I was. When you are sick, your classmates will share notes with you. When you are at your doctor's appointment, your classmate will fill you in with the information that was discussed in class. I understand if you are shy. I was shy, too. Start asking shy people if you are too scared to approach confident people. Just stay in touch with at least one person in your class. 

3. This one is similar to number two. Don't be stingy with your notes and study guides. When you share notes with others, good people will share their notes with you. Good karma will happen to you.

4. Go to office hours, especially your TAs. I know that you don't want to be dumb in front of your professor, so go see your TAs. They are students like you and most likely experiencing imposture syndrome. They understand how it feels to be dumb. You are paying thousands of dollars. Take advantage of this. Who cares if they think you are dumb? You won't see them ever again in 4 years. Meeting TAs and professor is a good way to ask for letters of recommendation. 

  
5. College is your time to make connections. You don't have to be friends with everyone but try to get to know people. Try to say hi and have small chats. Again, I used to HATE people, and it was so hard for me, but my connections later became beneficial to me. Make connections outside of your department. They will become helpful to you one day. For example, I met a random woman at an event, and we followed each other on Instagram. We never hung out after that, but we would wave at each other whenever we walked past one another. She later became a lawyer. Then I got divorced. I messaged her for advice, and she saved me thousands of dollars, although she was not my direct lawyer. Also, I met a plant biology major guy at my student club. At that time, I did not like plants. I later fell in love with plants and constantly sought advice from him to grow my plants. 

6. Go to the writing center. I don't care how smart you are. Just go and get some advice. If you don't think the writing tutor knows what they are saying, then just don't take their advice. 

7. Plan your deadlines. With the quarter system, it is easy to miss deadlines. The first week before school starts, you need to write down all the quiz, homework, and test dates. Write it down on your planner. Write it down on your calendar. I like having it in two places to remind me. 

8. You are here to study. That is your priority. Partying is important, but don't forget your priorities. Your party friends will not pay for your bills when you get dismissed. There are those people who party hard yet still do well. It is because they plan well and are smart about it. You need, too. They part on Friday and Saturday night, but they plan their whole week on Sunday. On the weekdays, they periodically study and always do their work. Don't be an idiot and think that they are ""naturally"" smart. Most people are not naturally smart. People just want to act like they are. I know so many partiers who claim to never study, but I see them always holding their work until it is Friday night and they are enjoying the floors. 

9. Go on dates. Please, go on dates. If you like someone, just ask them out. If you are shy and awakard, just do it. You will keep getting better. Practice makes better. College is the only time you are young. After college, you will be older, and dating will be harder. The more you talk to people, the more confident you become. Humans are weird and shy, just like you. Just don't be creepy. Talk to the other person like a friend.

His photo is my avatar. I cannot figure out how to post his picture any other way. 

This is a stretch, we are posting every where we can think of. 

Our friend is broken, he is a disabled veteran and this dog is his entire world. We don't know what happened but he got out of his apartment on East Roseville Parkway on Friday 11/29. Dog's name is Leo and he is very very friendly and we think he may be with someone that is being kind and sheltering a found dog.

Leo is chipped and the contact info is up to date.

Leo is about 55lbs, he's a light tan color pitbull with some dark color on his face. I'm going to try and add a picture, but I'm older and not great at this. 

I personally will give whomever returns Leo $500. NO QUESTIONS ASKED, we just need him home with his very sad owner.

I'm happy to answer any questions. Our friend put up flyers and some kids called him and told him they had his dog but they were just playing a cruel joke. :( No one deserves that level of cruelty. 

If you know anyone around East Roseville Pkwy, in Roseville, could you please ask them to keep an eye out?

Thank you for any kindness you are able to extend.

This isn't a scam/spam. I am posting on all the colleges' reddit pages in our area because the situation is so desperate.

1d44tuq,UCI,I'm Daniel Levine - Ask me anything!,"Good morning!

I've never been much of a reddit user (aside from the occasional information on rock climbing conditions) - but my name seems to have appeared in this community many times in the last week.

I teach for the Center for Jewish Studies at UCI and am the Rabbi for Hillel (a pluralistic institution - and the oldest and largest Jewish campus org in the country). And yes, I'm the person who used to teach Hist18a.

There's been so much talk about Jews, Jewish identity, history, antisemitism, Zionism, anti-Zionism etc, etc etc - so I thought this might be helpful. I also love open discussion and debate (my favorite part of Jewish tradition) so I welcome any/all questions and subsequent pushback - as long as it is in good faith. I won't answer questions that simply seem like attacks. For those too shy to ask me questions here - I am always happy to meet up in person on campus - just dm me.

There is a disturbing rise of polarization - not just here but everywhere. We have lost the ability to talk to one another, especially when we don't see eye to eye. For the sake of campus culture at UC Irvine - and really the future of the world - we need to find ways to co-exist amongst disagreements - instead of believing that anyone who disagrees with us is stupid or evil.

I'll try to get to every question - but it might take a couple days. Amidst my generally packed schedule - I also got a puppy which amounts to a part time job.

This is completely UCI's fault too other schools have already gotten their aid out to students BEFORE the deadlines. I'm getting so sick and tired of this university acting like it doesn't have the resources to be able to do important tasks efficiently as if they aren't a muti billion dollar school.

(Yeah, yeah, I'm old)

I haven't been following what's been happening with financial aid closely, but logged on tonight and caught up. I really want to encourage all of you to start emailing reporters, so they can start putting pressure on the school for answers. I also really want to encourage all of you [to email your Assemblywoman](https://a73.asmdc.org). The UC system is a state system, and she has purview/influence over the UC regents AND UCI.

The journalists can investigate what's happening exactly, and Petrie-Norris can start adding pressure and start investigating. 

(I say this as both a former reporter, and someone who would have started looking into something like this when I worked in state government)

Try emailing:

[rebecca.ellis@latimes.com](mailto:rebecca.ellis@latimes.com)

[lilly.nguyen@latimes.com](mailto:lilly.nguyen@latimes.com)

Rebecca  covers government, and this is government adjacent. Lilly writes for the Daily Pilot, which is the LAT's name for their local OC beach coverage.  The assemblywoman's contact information is available on the website.

Subject line should be something like: Are you aware of what's happening at UCI?

These bot/troll farm accounts pop up mainly on posts about the Palestine Protests but also come up elsewhere sometimes. Their posts constantly seek to divide student opinion, create or reinforce factions, and generally stoke anger and resentment. This has so far included stuff like:



[examples based on real comments, since most have been on the anti-protest side]
1. Calling for the arrest of all protestors;
2. Asking why protestors don‚Äôt quit school;
3. Demanding that protestors get jobs;
4. Claiming to represent the student body or know how all students feel (‚Äúeveryone i know and everyone in my dorm hall hates this movement now‚Äù).
5. Defending each other when called out or identified (‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you okay with people from outside UCI being on the subreddit? Reddit is about open dialogue!!).
6. Painting one side as rich/elitist/out of touch, to try and turn this into class conflict.
7. Brigading posts to downvote any opposition to them and make it so those posts are no longer visible.



I don‚Äôt know why these trolls are here, though I have some guesses (in a presidential election season where 80+% of college students are projected to vote on one side, sowing discord and uncertainty about a wedge issue for that side is a tactic that would be ‚ÄîVERY HELPFUL‚Äî for the opposing side).


But no matter what, you should know that they are here and use discernment as you scroll comments. Try and recognize when you are being forcefully influenced. 


Obviously, all you uci non robot humans out there, please keep talking to each other and sharing+encountering a variety of views, and engaging with each other respectfully. But at the same time, keep an eye out for these brand new profiles with no profile picture/avatar, no karma, and shitty robot names. A big skill to get from college is media literacy. üòóüòóüòó Research shows that scammers right now are having more luck scamming gen z than they are with scamming boomers. We need to be a little more alert online and learn the ways people will try to fuck with us.

1gpxxkm,UCI,It‚Äôs weird knowing that I‚Äôm going to be homeless again,"So when I was a junior in college, I was a commuter and left the family to couch hop, sleep in my car, and finally receive emergency housing for two months - I even managed to have a short term apartment. When you really want something, you‚Äôll do what you need to do to make it work. 

Well  I graduated this year, and I honestly didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be in this situation again. On paper, I did everything right- I got my degree, found a full time job in my field right after college, I scored an apartment with some roomies.

But then things started to fall apart- I won‚Äôt get into the details, but wow, being a young adult is tough. 

It feels like I have two options. I could keep going, live paycheck to paycheck making $21 an hour with a degree and five years of experience in the field, and keep my apartment. 

Or, I can save the extra 1200 a month, and put it into my savings. How? My beautiful amazing car- she‚Äôs not new, but when I originally slept in my car I had a smaller sedan. Now, I have a lil SUV (because I was paranoid about homelessness‚Ä¶ i guess I was right haha)

I feel like socially, this is going to suck. I can‚Äôt invite people over, I know I won‚Äôt be looked at in the best light when making new friends. It‚Äôs going to be very isolating - especially working 40 hours a week and not having a place to come home to. 

But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the benefits. If I do this, if I give up my lease and live in my car until I‚Äôm happy with my savings again, I have nothing to tie me down. 

I‚Äôm filled with this anxiety - of ‚Äúwhat if I get let go tomorrow‚Äù. Then I‚Äôm really homeless and broke. 

For me, doing this is in a small way to take back control of my life. If I can‚Äôt find a better paying job- literally was rejected from a coffee chain- then I need to find a way to create a financial buffer which will give me peace of mind and lessen my day to day anxiety. 

I know it‚Äôs not ideal. My friends don‚Äôt like the idea. All I know is that we live in hard times, so all we can do right now is create a plan and see what happens. 

If someone is also going through something similar, I feel for you. Maybe we can connect and go through this together. 

Anyways, UCI kiddos, I did it all right- and I‚Äôm still left in a very uncomfortable situation. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up, it‚Äôs not your fault, it‚Äôs the state of our world. We just need to adjust, and find a way to make the best of it.

He is dressed very formally and speaks in heavy Italian accent. He also seems genuine and very charismatic so I thought nothing of it.

I showed him the directions and he seems to be very grateful, and offers 4 ‚Äúunreleased Fendi‚Äù jackets that he claims worth over $20,000 to me as he cannot pay taxes for on the flight back home (he even put a lit lighter against it to prove the material is real leather üíÄ). But he then pulls out a bill stating that he needs around $2500 to pay for his rental car as his credit card is disabled and that he will pay me back as soon as he gets back to Milan. 

I am now suspicious of this man. I think he noticed and tries to prove that he‚Äôs legit and pulls out his photo album with some pretty obviously stock images of ‚Äúhis‚Äù mansion. I declined his offer of the jackets and walked away.

I later did some digging and found out the ‚Äúunreleased Fendi‚Äù jackets that he offered me is worth $45 a piece on eBay: https://www.ebay.com/itm/156179418831

I left out quite a bit of details such as some of the claims he made about influential people that he knows, him trying really hard to sell me the idea that the jackets are really expensive and legit, and that he asked me to take out as much money as possible after I told him I don‚Äôt have enough money, etc.

at this point, UCI is well aware of the issue, and still is admitting ‚Äúrecord amounts‚Äù of new and transfer students each year. it almost feels like survival of the fittest (or i guess, survival of the people with 50k of disposable income a year) as it stands now, with rent seemingly rising by the day. there‚Äôs simply *not enough housing*.

1fzn71q,UCI,Fellowship Church on campus is a Cult! Beware of these thugs that recruit vulnerable college students!,"""AWSOM"" changed their name to ""Fellowship Church"" to get away with their pyramid, money laundering scheme and exploitation and abuse of young vulnerable adults. 

If you don't know anything about this group here's some info:
AWSOM/Fellowship Church is a cult similar to scientology. The cult started in San Ramon CA by Matt W. They were once called Elevate, Lifeway, AWSOM and now Fellowship Church.

Here are some things you should know:
The group members prey on young college students and go to many campuses including Saddleback, OCC, Pomona, IVC, UCI and more to gain more members. They ask people if they want to work on their spirituality or if they‚Äôd like to be ‚Äúsaved‚Äù and ‚Äúbaptized.‚Äù DO NOT give them your number as they will constantly harrass you to join their bible study lectures and group activities 
The ""pastor"" is a fraud who steals the churches contribution money and keeps it for himself 
This group breaks up families. They tell their members that in order to get closer to god, one must leave behind their family, work, school, everything and sacrifice it all for God
They send death threats to people who speak out against them.
They will contact your work to try and get you fired if you speak out against them.
The pastor is a predator. He‚Äôs in his 50s and has a child with a 20 year old that he met in his church. he groomed her.
They don't have a physical building they only meet up in parks 
Most of their teachings are taken from the actual Bible and then twisted so that they can manipulate and brainwash their members. 
They expect their members to pay $100 a week and if you don't, they tell you you're going to hell 
They believe that anybody who leaves their group is going to hell 
The pastor has physically assaulted members and is verbally and emotionally abusive 
This ""church"" group on campus are NOT students. 

This group does not believe in mental illness, or mental health. One of their tactics is keeping people who struggle with mental health in a state of instability so they can further control and abuse them.

They call people who have left the group ‚Äúfallaways"" and like to twist the scenario by saying these people left because they no longer believe in God, but these people left because of the emotional and for some, physical abuse they endured, as well as financial exploitation. 

Members of this church are expected to pay $100 a week. If you don't meet the weekly payment $100 you will be scolded and humiliated. Ultimately, the ‚Äúchurch"" is just a pyramid scheme and the ""pastor"" set it up like this in order to gain an income financially. 

Their church has no physical location and they meet every week at a park for ""service"" Most of their service is just them talking down on people who have left the church and also about how important it is that members give money every week. Once you're in the church, they also convince you to leave your family and cut off all communication with them, as well as convince you to drop out of school. There are people who have left this group just to have no family to go home to, and it absolutely breaks my heart. This ""church"" is similar to scientology but is actually derived from ICC. ICC in a In of ways, is similar to scientology.

I'm trying really hard to get AWSOM/Fellowship Church banned off campus, and someone shared ‚ÄúI have read comments from people who've been followed to class or into buildings by AWSOM recruiters, after having repeatedly told them they're not interested. This is certainly against campus campus student conduct policies, and might be enough to get them kicked from that campus if it were documented with video evidence."" So if AWSOM/ Fellowship church approaches you and won't back off, Record! Record! Record! Record!
And show it to campus police!
Please stay safe and stay in school!

They are constantly twisting scripture but the really scary part is they do it in a very compelling way. They know exactly what points to hit to make you doubt. At least in my experience with them they had one newer guy have a Bible study with you and then a more experienced guy watch from afar in case they need help or you show some sort of pushback.
Christian or not, nobody is immune to manipulation.
Spreading the gospel is an amazing thing but they are definitely not doing that. Stay safe y'all

 I don't think anybody would be surprised to hear that there are coyotes living in the empty field just up the street from the ARC... You can see evidence of them on the ground in the area and at night you can actually see them crossing the streets. 

 However, yesterday I was taking my 6-month-old puppy for a walk near the ARC in the morning and we were ambushed by what I have to assume is a desperate coyote who was hiding in the brush next to the sidewalk. Thankfully my pup is a very alert breed and realized The danger before I could even process what was happening, and he managed to avoid the coyote's teeth by running a few laps around me with the coyote chasing him. 

After a few seconds I realized what was going on and I managed to scare the coyote off, but I can't believe that a coyote would come after a medium-sized dog accompanied by a full-grown man. This coyote must have been incredibly hungry to take such a risk, so if you're going to be walking near the ARC please be alert and watch the vegetation on the side of the sidewalk very carefully, especially if you have an animal or are small of frame.",-0.53,Athletics

I went to the financial aid office in person today, because their phone lines are down and they never called me for my fin aid phone apt on sept 4th.... But the lady I met with was really kind and helpful. Basically I'm an incoming transfer student who had already received my fin aid award letter months ago, I had been assured that the amount I saw under the financial aid summary tab would be the amount I should receive (I have full tuition covered along with a small amount of excess money that I plan to put towards living costs) The other day I had checked my student portal and my financial aid summary and all of my messages were GONE. As if I never got an award offer. It fully freaked me out especially because I'm seeing that some people are experiencing a change in aid/ the amount they thought they'd receive. The women I met with reassured me that this is just a glitch because for some reason to send out continuing students aid they had to put other students award letters on ""hold"" which resulted in the disappearance of aid summaries on other students portals that had already received their award letters. So she basically just told me to stay calm and that the aid I saw in the first place is still the aid I should expect to receive... Still feels a little sketchy but she made me feel a lot better about everything. She also said the middle class scholarship amount I should expect to receive should be on the web grants 4 students account, and that just because it's not on my original award letter does not mean I won't be receiving that, because the middle class scholarship gets disbursed later in the quarter it doesn't show up on the award summary. Anyways thought I would share since I know many others had the same scare that I did. Also they say that their not taking walk in appointments but mostly everyone in line was a walk in, and the line wasn't too bad at the time I went. Probably waited about 30 min.

1gxx4jg,UCI,Is CS major game over? A reflection by a recent ICS alum.,"With the tons of doomsday post I saw recently, I am writing this post as an opinon piece on how I feel about getting a CS degree at UCI. For context I am a 2024 grad, majoring in CS and BIM.

\---

**Stick with the CS major** if you just know that is what you would love to do for the rest of your life. You are willing to spend a lot time outside class to learn everything about it. You would go for hackathons just for fun. You sacrafice your free time to convert your idea to product with code. You spent time reading research papers and attending conferences on latest CS trend. You would love code as a job even if pays the same like a public school teacher.

**Drop CS major** if you are in it just for the money. Or your sister's dog told you to do it. Or you feel pressured because all your friends are doing it. Or you do it to make your parents proud. Or you are fooled by the tiktok influencers that a SDE job is just you getting paid by doing nothing.

There's nothing wrong about dropping a major you don't like. ""Only way to¬†*do*¬†great work is to¬†*love what you do*"". The world is very big and your talent may just blossom somewhere else. You will be working for 30+ years, you can't just wake up everyday hate what you do right?

\----

**Is the job market terrible?**

(opinion) Yes, but I have waitnessed an upward trend in opportunities. 2023 new grads are certainly hit the hardest. Then 2024 new grads are having it slightly better. But with the Fed lower the interest rates for 2025 new grads and beyond, I already see a lot of new posts. For example, Google barely hired anyone in 2023 &amp; 2024, but in 2025 they are restarting campus recruitment with a very sizable head count.

**What's the difficult part in CS recruitment?**

(opinion) Standing out is very difficult. There are just too many candidates. For example, at UCI almost everyone will have CS122B project listed on the resume, so if you are just doing that, you are barely at your competition. Class projects are just not well-perceived by the recruiter. To stand out in personal project part of the resume, for example, you would build stuff on your own and have real world users. If you just don't love CS by a lot it is very hard to justify spending huge amount of the time that you can hangout with your friends and instead code in your room. Again, it is when your true passion for CS will shine through.

**What about leetcode? Do you really have to do 1000+ nowadays?**

(opinon) I certainly see a trend that coding interviews becoming harder. So it is true that previously you can do 50 questions and have a good chance but now your need maybe 200. But anything above 250 is not that necessary. In the end it's all old DSA new tricks. So it's far from ""1000+ Leetcode or doom"" vibe that some may believe. But if competitive programming brings you all the pleasure than certainly go ahead and have fun.

**I am an international student, am I doomed?**

Anyone needs visa sponsorship will find it very, very difficult to find a job and stay in US now. This may be the only reason that I may discourage a geniuely CS-loving person to get a CS degree here in US. First, contrast to the popular belief that intl students are robbing jobs out of Americans, there are maybe 1 in 100 companies that hire intls in the first place. And competition at these firms, usually bigger tech, are extreme. The selection rate could be 0.1% or lower for new grad roles. Secondly, anything comes to visa and immigration for now is very luck-based. You could get lucky and have your immigration sorted out in under a year, or get it dragged on for over 10 years, which you may need to relocate to another country. So if spending 100k in tuition and not getting anything back is OK, and you view studying aboard in US as an experience and not an investment, and you love CS, then certainly go head.

**Anything I could do to improve my chance of landing jobs?**

(opinion) It is all about trouble shooting conversion rates. My view for US Citizen and GC holder is: 30 apps should get you 1 OA. 20 OAs should get you 10 first round interview invite. 10 final round interviews will result in 1 offer or 2. So if your OA conversion is too low you need to get your resume reviewed and possibly padded in some way. If you fail OA more you need to practice leetcode. If you can't make pass the interview pipeline, you need to sharpen your interview skills. If you fail 10 final round in a row... maybe you are really, really, really unlucky. For intls: sorry no estimation, this whole visa sponsorships are so negatively affecting that it is very hard to predict the conversion rates.

**Is UCI a good school for CS in terms of recruiting?**

(opnion) Semi target for a lot of tech companies. Can't expect that offers rain from sky like if you go to HYPSM career fairs, but having the degree on resume won't be the sole blocker that filter you out. Maybe some quant firms are getting picky and they can, but for most firms, CS degree from UCI checks the box and you can get moved forward if you have good other experience/projects that meet's the firm's criteria. Even for quant firms I see some students secure offer from very top firms so my opnion on that could be entirely inaccurate as well.",-0.23,Academics

Lee (GYNOB) was so condescending when she‚Äôs talking to me that‚Äôs the experience of seeing her left me traumatized. She gave me a finger exam while I am on the midst of my intense period pain. She saw how I struggled with pain FIRSTHAND! BUT when I told her that I am concerned about taking too much painkiller (5 otc dosage pill a day). She just prescribed me the clinical strength painkiller and implied that it is because I wasn‚Äôt taking ‚Äúenough dosages of painkiller‚Äù to stop my pain. Basically my pain wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúintense enough‚Äù to make her take me seriously because I wasn‚Äôt taking the clinically safe upper limit dosage even though I almost cried when she was giving me the finger exam?? I asked LEE if I could have endometriosis and want to discuss how common it is to be misdiagnosed, but all she was interested in was to get me to try birth control. I told her about my mental health history and concern about Oral BC. She basically just told me to roll dice. The pills she prescribed gave me the worst depression episodes I have experienced in YEARs. This may be just her personality but she also scoffed at my questions and concerns at least 5 times during the visit.

Jun had good bedside manners, but she gave me complete false medical information on my visits. I experienced a lot of mental fatigue and I asked her if I could test for iron deficiency and she said that there‚Äôs no way that I could be deficient because my hemoglobin is enough. But she did not tell me that iron deficiency should be interpreted from ferritin. NOT hemoglobin!! I believed her but six months later another SHC physician ran my iron level, that is when I find out that people actually can experience a lot of of symptoms from low iron, even though they have a normal hemoglobin. My ferritin was 15, which could explain all the shitty symptoms I was feeling. Apparently it is common knowledge to most physicians! That woman had me believe false medical information for six month!!

The second visit with her I asked for a Xray to screen for a certain type of bone issue, because my family has a medical history. She said that this condition is usually ‚Äúnot genetic‚Äù, fortunately this time she ordered the Xray, which confirmed that I had that condition. It was until later that I found out my condition is almost 98% genetically connected to a dominant allele. It is almost unlikely that my condition could be a diet/lifestyle problem. I don‚Äôt know how this woman can just churn out false information so effortlessly. 

Please avoid these two doctors if you are serious about your health. I‚Äôve had really good experiences with Sarah Campbell, George Huang, Miki Csintalan

I was accepted late off the waitlist and immediately signed up for housing for which I didn't know it would be this tough to snag a spot. And not to mention all the empty rooms only for students who are still on the waitlist not get housing? I ended up subletting near campus until end of September, so didn't have a permanent local address until I got a full place by October. 

Secondly, the financial aid headache was big for me because their platform wouldn't let me pay for the longest time and finally was able to after having to incessantly call OIT.  

The worst was parking. When I went to buy a parking pass for October, there wasn't any option for me to buy one, and I had put my new updated address in student access a bit later than what I would've wanted but I waited 7 days and it still didnt update. I submitted a change of address later after my sublet because I didn't have a permanent address to put, and still no changes. By the time I had a permanent address, the registrar still didnt update anything and I couldn't book a pass in zone 5, because guess what. its sold OUT.  
  
I know these are first world problems, but I feel so disconnected with my classmates now because I wasn't able to on campus housing and I'm paying a buttload for off campus in a far away place where I also have to still pay for a permit, and the whole parking thing is super inconvenient.

1fzk39g,UCI,120 swipe meal plan is a SCAM (and why $300 flexdine + 6 bonus meals is the best meal plan),"TLDR: The $2000 for 120 swipes and $350 flex dine gives less value than the $300 for $300 flex dine and 6 bonus meals meal plan, and you are always better off buying the $300 meal plan over the $2000 meal plan.

The $2000 meal plan gives 120 swipes and $350 flex dine dollars. To get into the dining halls without swipes, it would cost $15.75 USD, or $14.62 flex dine dollars. Spending the remaining $350 flex dine dollars on swipes, you would be able to enter the dining hall an additional 350/14.62=24 times (rounded up), for a total of 144 meals. This averages $2000/144=$13.89 per meal with this meal plan. 

In comparison, when you buy the $300 meal plan for $300 flex dine and 6 swipes, you can get into the dining hall 300/14.62+6=26 times (rounded down), so you are paying an average of 300/26=$11.54 per meal with this meal plan. 

In conclusion, even if you want to eat at the dining halls, the $300 meal plan still presents the better deal, saving you over $2 per meal. In fact, the $2000 meal plan has no advantages at all, since by spending $1800 to buy the $300 meal plan 6 times you would be able to eat at the dining hall the same 120 times but with 571.92 flex dine dollars left over, while also spending $200 less. The same calculations can be done to show that both the 85 meals + $300 flex dine and 35 meals + 325 flex dine meal plans are even lower value than the 120 meals + $350 flex dine meal plan.",-0.93,Finance

UC Irvine, or as some call it, ‚ÄúUC Invisible,‚Äù because honestly, half the world couldn‚Äôt find it on a map even if you pointed to Orange County. Its mascot, the Anteater, is more confusing than intimidating‚Äîno offense, but who looks at an anteater and thinks, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the energy we want for our school spirit?‚Äù

Then there‚Äôs the architecture. Are we a university or a collection of mid-tier office parks? Ring Road is basically a glorified running track where students speed-walk in flip-flops, trying to dodge club recruiters shoving flyers at them. And let‚Äôs not forget Aldrich Park, the heart of campus, where all the grass looks perfect for a picnic until you realize there‚Äôs no shade because the trees were planted for aesthetics, not utility.

Academics? Sure, it‚Äôs a solid school, but UCI‚Äôs vibe is like the middle child of the UC system: decent grades, no drama, but no one remembers its birthday. People don‚Äôt even hate on it because it‚Äôs too meh to provoke strong feelings.

And food? You either survive on overpriced fusion bowls at UTC or resign yourself to the repetitive cycle of Panda Express and Starbucks. Not to mention, the dorms are so overpriced that they might as well come with a free car‚Äîoh wait, they don‚Äôt, because you‚Äôll never find parking anyway.

At least Irvine‚Äôs safe, though. But let‚Äôs be real: It‚Äôs so safe it‚Äôs boring. Downtown nightlife? Nonexistent. Your best bet for fun is a Target run or pretending to be bougie at a dessert cafe.

And let‚Äôs not even get started on the tuition hikes. You‚Äôre dropping stacks for a degree only for someone to ask, ‚ÄúSo, is that near UCLA?‚Äù",-0.83,Politics

BEWARE OF THIS GROUP

They are the group of young adults that approach college students and ask them if they believe in god, read the Bible or want to work on their faith. Block their numbers if they approach you on campus!!!!! They are desperate to bring people in to squeeze out money out of them. They are usually always by the student center by Pereira Drive and are usually in groups of 2 or 3. They also go to IVC every Wednesday around 10 AM and approach students by the student services area. The way they approach students is so calculated, they know exactly who to target and usually go after students with mental health issues, brainwash them and ask them for $100 donations every week. They are illegal and are not a real church. Everything they do is calculated, even down to the way they play sports. The pastor‚Äôs daughter played basketball and he organizes most of the games. They target people of color and promise them a family and have their members quit their job, drop out of school, exhile their family and friends.  They used to be a group of 500 people and are now down to 100, so eighty percent of them managed to escape. Let‚Äôs stick together and help the rest of the other members 





Before joining a religious group on campus, do your research. if they are asking you to drop everything and join. It doesn't add up. They have changed their names many times. And why?

You can see it all under the California Secretary of State website.

-2009 San Francisco International Christian Church. (ICC) -Tri-Valley Church. -2020 Lifeway Christian Church. and Awsom Church.

2 different Churches they are now operating Lifeway Christian and Awsom Church

The leader signed his InCorporations but has executed others acting as Agents on his behalf. Why? Non Profit organizations need to have their financial statements Public. Where are they? from 2020 till now?



THE TRUTH ABOUT FELLOWSHIP CHURCH/AWSOM:

1. They go through peoples phone 

2. You can‚Äôt talk to anyone that leaves the church 

3. They ask you to quit work and drop out of school 

4. The pastor, MW, is verbally and physically abusive and he is a pedophile (I can send his name if you privately chat me)

5. If you try to leave, they will physically stop you 

7. They show up to your house unwarranted 

8. If you leave the church, they harass you and send death threats 

9. If you speak out against them, they harass you and send death threats 

10. They‚Äôve stolen peoples belongings 

11. The pastor has asked people to leave positive reviews on his business because it was failing 

12. Many people have been homeless or living in small apartments with bunk beds while he lives in a mansion 

14. At one point, the church had 500 members. It now has 169. 

15. Apostles are required to pay $100 a week 

16. They pressure you to pay contributions and if you don‚Äôt, they tell you that you don‚Äôt really love God 

17. If you don‚Äôt pay contribution every week, they start pressuring you to 

18. You can only date people in the church and only the pastor can decide who you date 

19. They claim to be ‚Äúthe one and only church‚Äù If you leave the church they‚Äôll say you left because you don‚Äôt want to worship God, but people leave because of how toxic this group is 

20. They belittle people who struggle with mental health 

21. Every time they get called out, they change their names: Elevate Church, LifeWay, Tri-Valley Church, LifeWay San Ramon and now AWSOM 

22. They make you sign an NDA form. The pastor says the NDA form is to protect members of the church but if you read the form thoroughly, it‚Äôs actually to protect him. The NDA form is just a scare tactic though. It holds no weight. 

23. The pastor is a member of ICC and that‚Äôs where he gets his teachings from 

24. The members of the church have to pay for everything using their own money and EBT card, while the pastor keeps all the contributions 

25. He says he‚Äôs gonna start paying apostles. He‚Äôll pay them for a week and then cut them off. He‚Äôs done this multiple times. 

26. He gets his group to constantly harass people who have left the church 

27. The pastor has a basketball business. his daughter played basketball in san ramon, CA

28. If you leave the church, the pastors daughter Kayla, will harass you on burner phone numbers 

29. He tells people ‚Äújust sign the NDA form, you don‚Äôt need to read it‚Äù 

30. The leaders are extremely good at brainwashing people. You wont even know you‚Äôre being brainwashed. Some of us are smart though, and got out. 

31. If you try to leave the group, sometimes they will PHYSICALLY stop you from leaving. 

32. They‚Äôre told what to say and do 

33. If you haven‚Äôt shown up in a while or you go M.I.A, they‚Äôll show up to your house 

34. You‚Äôre absolutely not allowed to talk to anyone who‚Äôs left the group because they have information they don‚Äôt want newer members to find out. 

35. Many people have cut off theirs families for this group, and have no home to go to if they try to leave. 

36. The pastor says he doesn‚Äôt have access to the bank account that the contributions go to. This is false. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, call Martinez Courthouse in California and ask for every document they got on MW (can send full boxes of proof.)

37. If you leave the group, they tell members to block you and ignore your messages because they don‚Äôt want them finding out the truth 

38. His source of income is the contributions that are given to him each week. 

39. Members of the church are manipulated into believing that anytime someone speaks out against the church, they are being ‚Äúpersecuted‚Äù 



IF YOU OR ANYONE YOU KNOW HAS BEEN VERBALLY HARASSED, PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED, OR THREATENED, PLEASE FILE A POLICE REPORT.

I've made a lot of progress with my mental health and overall belief in myself. Finals count for a lot of my grade, and I have a good 2 weeks to prepare for those.

1eie853,UCI,An Anteater's Guide to UCI,"https://preview.redd.it/7gdzi0yoz9gd1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e43095026bbc68d726ecc5ca4ad98f941355bd11

To our incoming first year, transfer and graduate students, congrats on getting accepted and welcome to UCI! As a rising fourth year, many friends from community college and friends' siblings coming from high school have always asked me:

&gt;How can I succeed at UCI?

After years of answering the same question and being in those shoes just three years ago, I don't want incoming students to sift through hours of old Reddit posts, Discord messages and info sessions - that's to say, I won't be able to answer every single question that you might have with this guide so you should still do your own research!

I'll break this guide into five chapters:

1. How do I choose courses/ professors?
2. How do I get research and other extracurricular opportunities?
3. How can I keep my costs as low as possible?
4. How do I make friends?
5. What else should I know?

Let's get started!

https://preview.redd.it/0lkf7p0sz9gd1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520090fde646860798f740e2b118f64a9411623b

Some of you have heard of these tools already through SPOP/ TSPOP but if you haven't, you should always consult these websites before picking your classes every quarter: Rate My Professors, Zotistics, AntAlmanac and DegreeWorks!

1. [Rate My Professors (RMP)](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/)
   * Two or more professors teaching the same course and you don't know who to choose? Search up your UCI professors at RMP and see testimonies and reviews from your fellow UCI students!

* [Zotistics](https://zotistics.com/)
   * Still unsure about who to choose? Search up your course and professor at Zotistics and see real grade distributions of A's, B's, C's, etc. from past quarters! This can often be the deciding factor between two similarly-rated RMP professors.
* [AntAlmanac](https://antalmanac.com/)
   * Want to see how your weekly schedule looks like? Input your courses here and start your pseudo-GCal journey! Any class you put here will also have it's location and directions to the lecture hall/ classroom.
* [DegreeWorks](https://www.reg.uci.edu/access/student/welcome/)
   * Unsure about which classes you need to take over the next four years? Go to the hyperlink and click on ""DegreeWorks"" on the left-hand side. You'll see your unfulfilled and fulfilled major requirements!

Despite how useful these resources are, if you're still confused or need any more help, every school/ department has a students affairs office where you can hold a Zoom chat or phone call, you can also email if talking isn't your thing. Your department faculty, graduate advisors and undergraduate peer academic advisors are there to help you! Schedule an appointment [here](https://appointments.web.uci.edu/)!

If you're ever frustrated with your enrollment window, do understand that students with higher units will have higher priority. However, there are ways to bypass this restriction through priority enrollment groups which include:

1. [Disabled](https://dsc.uci.edu/)
2. Academic Programs
   1. [Campuswide Honors Collegium](https://honors.uci.edu/)
   2. [Summer Bridge](https://summerbridge.due.uci.edu/)
3. Athletes
4. [Military](https://veteran.uci.edu/)
5. [Foster Youth/ Former Foster Youth](https://fyre.due.uci.edu/)
6. [Student Parents](https://ssi.uci.edu/spf/)

With that, that should be all the resources you might use to help choose your classes! If your professor isn't on RMP/ Zotistics, I highly recommend asking in your associated school's unofficial Discord servers!

https://preview.redd.it/brom7vmtz9gd1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=384005f0ba2c4af836a843186cc63bc581be941a

Probably the most asked question at any university. When it comes to research and extracurriculars, it's always fairly competitive - there's only a limited amount of spots at every lab or organization. But that shouldn't deter you. Everyone that I know has managed to find a research lab and a couple of extracurriculars at UCI by their second or third year as long as they were committed to finding one. Now, how can you?

1. [BIO 199](https://undergraduate-research.bio.uci.edu/student)
   1. If you're pre-med or wanting to explore science-focused research, consider **BIO 199**! At the hyperlink and the section ""Faculty Sponsors,"" you can see a list of professors who are actively looking for students to join their lab. After you find a couple of labs you're interested in, click on their tab and give them a [cold email](https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/wp.ovptl.uci.edu/dist/e/3/files/2024/03/Email-to-Faculty-074a7e48dc6194dc.pdf). Without experience, you might face rejection after rejection and you might not even find an opportunity by the end of your first year - but that's okay. There will be time for you to build up your resume and experiences, and there will be a lab that's willing to take a chance on you. Don't give up, just keep fighting.
2. [Associated Students of UCI (Student Government)](https://asuci.uci.edu/positions/apply/)
   1. UCI has several branches in our student government with commissions that serve very different purposes such as the Mental Health Commission, Concerts Commission, Financial Wellness Commission, Vendor Fair Commission, Garden Commission and many more! Many of the intern positions are entry-level, requiring very little to no experience to get accepted as long as your essays and/ or interview performance is strong. After being an intern, apply as a Director for the following year! In this role, you'll take a more involved role where you coordinate events, speak with UCI faculty, manage interns, publicize events, get paid (very little) and more!
3. Asking your professors.
   1. If you end up really enjoying one of your professors' courses this upcoming Fall, don't hesitate to ask them if they have any research opportunities for you! Many of my friends have gotten their Research Assistant positions this way, so give it a shot! These opportunities may not be posted on BIO 199 or other websites so there might be less competition as well
4. Asking your friends.
   1. One of your friends may have already landed a research lab RA position especially if they're a 3rd+ year. If their lab interests you, it doesn't hurt to ask if you can get involved! Like with asking a professor, the internal aspect leads to less competition.
5. [Handshake](https://app.joinhandshake.com/stu)
   1. Once you get your UCI-affiliated Handshake account, explore your options! When Fall quarter starts, many positions start to open up (especially for work study students) for research, on-campus jobs, etc. There are also opportunities outside of UCI that you can apply to as well - this is how I got my summer internship this year!
6. Google
   1. Searching up ""&lt;insert research interest here&gt; UCI lab"" may lead you to a research lab's dedicated website. Usually, these websites have a section for potential RA's that have you email their lab, fill out a Google Form, etc. When looking for research opportunities outside of the sciences, this is your go-to. There are also faculty lists which you can navigate and cold email professors/ graduate students as well (ex. this is the faculty list for the [School of Public Health](https://publichealth.uci.edu/about/our-faculty/)) Apart from research, I have also found several internship positions through Google alone by applying directly to an organization's website.
7. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/)
   1. The most unreliable of them all: LinkedIn. Unlike the other options above, you will be competing with applicants all across the globe instead of just UCI students. This will make rejections a lot more common. However, LinkedIn will lead you to many non-UCI internships, jobs and other positions that will make you stand out and these opportunities may interest you even more than what UCI can offer. I've also received internships this way, so give it a chance!

Apart from what was stated above, you can attend job fairs, look at your school's newsletter, ask friends from clubs, check out UCI research Discord servers and more! With that said, don't feel pressured or disappointed if you can't find a research position or internship by your first year. Sometimes things aren't going to work out the way you want them too. That is perfectly fine as long as you don't give up :)

https://preview.redd.it/qdvrt06wz9gd1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c662e1bdbe9ef2eaf917bfc46b4a4575636ea737

You will soon or have already realized that college is expensive! However, there are ways to make UCI a bit more affordable through waiving UC SHIP, CalFresh/ EBT, UC SHIP alternatives, scholarships, FAFSA aid/ grants/ loans and part-time jobs!

1. Consider waiving UC SHIP.
   1. Many of you already have health insurance plans that meet UC SHIP's requirements, so waive it and save thousands per quarter [here](https://shc.uci.edu/insurance/waiving-ship/apply-for-waiver). For international students (and especially graduate internationals), consider alternatives like Kimber Health's [World Elite](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.kimberhealth.com/new-applications?pc=4203__;!!CzAuKJ42GuquVTTmVmPViYEvSg!JJqTKosBtgIKgUWbD_0AwtDseOIDFFPCErL3PMXKeXP9b0WS1Yhdd74wWSRdrM5X95eWo2ZmM-g$) series which can be around $2000+ cheaper than UC SHIP! However, it's important that you do your research to see if UC SHIP would work better for you. Let me know if you need any help!
2. [CalFresh/ EBT](https://www.getcalfresh.org/)
   1. Apply for food stamps! If you qualify, you can get up to $297/ month to use for groceries and food; some places that take EBT include UCI's Zot n' Go, Costco, Trader Joes, Target and many more! If you need help on the application process, UCI's Basic Needs Center provides free 1-on-1 [CalFresh Application Assistance](https://basicneeds.uci.edu/)!
3. [Scholarships](https://uci.scholarshipuniverse.com/)
   1. UCI has a dedicated scholarship website where you can set up a profile and see what scholarships you best qualify for - check the hyperlink! However, just like with extracurriculars, you will more often that not be rejected for many that you apply to. But if you're dedicated, there's an off chance you'll get accepted for one! I received a $5,000 scholarship this past year through UCI's ScholarshipUniverse! LinkedIn also has many postings about scholarships, so consider using that as well.
4. Understanding [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa)
   1. As of today, all incoming students should have received their FAFSA aid reports! Let's break down the terminology a bit. Any gift aid you receive will go directly to your tuition and other fees and any leftovers will be sent to you via direct deposit! Grants also fall under gift aid - many of you may have received a Cal Grant! Concerning loans, you must pay them back. A subsidized loan is your best option. Imagine that you borrow $30,000, you will owe $30,000 once you graduate. An unsubsidized student loan accumulates interest and compounds over time. Imagine that same $30,000 possibly becoming $40,000 by the time you graduate.
5. Part-time jobs
   1. Consider a part-time job! As I mentioned before, if you qualify as a work-study student, take advantage of that. Handshake has several work-study options such as department administrative assistant, UCI Dining associate, research assistant and many more! You can also look to part-time jobs at the nearby plaza right next to UCI, the University Town Center (unaffiliated with UCI), where you can work in food service!

https://preview.redd.it/09n6bcfyz9gd1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bc8730a2e3b835d9c7a3dae361a87e6763b1576

UCI has a reputation of being a commuter school - after around 5pm, you will find very few people on UCI campus. Does that mean you should expect a nonexistent social life? Yes and no. If you commute straight home after classes or stay in your dorm room, you will get what you receive. If you attend club meetings and socials, take part in ASUCI events, talk to people in your classes + SPOP and make plans, you will get what you receive. How can you lean toward the latter this upcoming Fall?

1. Attend the [Anteater Involvement Fair (AIF)](https://campusorgs.uci.edu/signature-programs-events/fall-quarter/anteater-involvement-fair/) on Week 0.
   1. \`On Monday, 9/23/24 from 11am to 4pm, hundreds of registered campus organizations (RCOs) aka clubs and UCI departments booth to recruit members and to get to know you! Take advantage of AIF, lean into your interests whether its your hobbies, culture or something else. The following week, most clubs host their first meeting where you can meet others just like you - lonely and seeking friends (just kidding). Jokes aside, you can meet other students just coming into UCI and form a friend group, join a research lab, apply for a peer educator position, and more!
2. Search up UCI clubs on Instagram and attend their events.
   1. Didn't attend AIF? Search up clubs on Instagram and see what piques your interest! As I said before, many RCOs hold their events the following week after Week 0 (Week 1), so attend and see if you like it or not.
3. Talk to other students.
   1. When you attend your classes this upcoming Fall quarter, talk to people! Ask them about their major, year, interests, whatever, more likely than not they might be looking for friends too. You could even go to club meetings with them if y'all vibe like that.

&gt;How can I succeed at UCI?

Do what interests **you**, and **you only**. Remember that it's okay to take your time. College isn't a race and there's no one ""right"" path to follow. If you don't end up getting the things you want, that's perfectly fine and you try again. I think it's vital that you avoid comparing your journey with others; what works for someone else might not work for you. Your unique experiences and challenges shape who you are, and that's something to embrace. So, take a deep breath, give yourself grace, and focus on your own growth. Whether that means taking a lighter course load, exploring the social scene or taking time to find the right opportunities, prioritize what feels right for you. Success isn't about keeping up with others; it's about staying true to yourself and finding your own way. I think the world is a much brighter place when we all do our own thing. **Don't you?**",0.85,Finance

1fipx2x,UCI,Let's actually do something about OFAS,"Idk about everyone else, but I'm studying abroad as a student whose family is living off of SSDI and dead broke while paying my ACC rent at the same time (housing office won't approve sublease application) because UCI was supposed to **disburse** aid specially for study abroad students over a month ago. Obviously, they have not.

Until now I was just obessively checking my aid portal and looking at the daily updates, but I finally pulled myself together and sent emails to Irvine's assemblywoman and reporters from the LA Times, OC Register, LAist, and NBC LA as recommended by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/1fge5wq/hey_students_impacted_by_financial_aid_start/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button).

If you're mad at UCI and OFAS, might as well rant in the form of an email and send that to reporters.

pm me if you would like to see that email that I sent to use as an example.

1gwpqyk,UCI,I honestly want to die.,"I‚Äôm a 3rd year mechanical engineering major. My classes get more and more difficult and all build upon each other. Freshman and sophomore year I did okay in my classes and would pass with B‚Äôs and a couple C‚Äôs, but I would forget information after taking the courses. As a junior now, I struggle to remember all the information I need to from previous courses and feel like my classes have gotten so hard that no matter how hard I study or try I am just not smart enough. A couple weeks ago I had 2 midterms back to back, one of which i studied for over a week and pulled 3 all nighters studying for, only to get less than 50% and well below the class exam average. This midterm had an in class and online portion which we had to take the following night, leaving me no time to study for my midterm the next day. I drank a celsius after finishing the online portion at around 11 pm and intended to stay up and study for my midterm the next day. But, I was so exhausted and nauseous from staying up the 2 previous nights and passed out within an hour. The next day during my midterm, 2 different versions were handed out. I was given the more difficult one, which ended up having a 12% lower average than the other version. I completely bombed it, and the professor has not given any curve for either version, or even fixed the 12% discrepancy between the two different exam versions, despite a below 40% average for my version. I feel like this school has taken away any and all confidence or self esteem I ever had. No one in my major seems to be exhausted and struggling the way I am and I feel alone and confused. I wish any course instructors I‚Äôve ever had would care about students and see the way I‚Äôm struggling. I feel so helpless.",-0.83,Mental Health

1gtxdyy,UCI,Email Etiquette - Request don't accuse,"A little PSA from a TA about email etiquette to help reach a win-win between students and teaching staff.  

The basic premise is anything that can be phrased as a request or question should be phrased as such.   
This is especially true for statements which when not phrased as a request or question, sound like an accusation, a criticism or a demand.  

Compare different students who submitted late work but were told it would be graded. They tell me they haven't received grades yet and say:  
Student A: Is it right that I can still get points for this?   
Student B: Do you know when you'll be able to grade them?    
Student C: What's happening with the grading?    
Student D: When will you grade it?   
Student E: You must have forgot. 

For me, A, B and C are equally good, they just reflect different levels of certainty about what has been communicated. D is okay, it comes off less polite (which some people DO care about) but I get it you're worried about your grade. E comes off terribly. It's basically the equivalent of saying I'm stupid and bad at my job. Now I'm a human and I do forget things (actually kind of a lot) but it's best not to assume that of someone else. And if I really did forget, all the other emails serve as equally good reminders and I'm an honest guy, if I did forget I'll probably email you back and apologize and do the grading. But maybe it's just not a priority, so I'll do it when I get to it (in fact it might now be delayed because I'm annoyed at an email).        
  
I am usually very chill about emails, like I don't care if you wish me well or not in the email. Plus I know it can be stressful for email people so I don't want to add to that but a little bit of consideration goes a long way.",0.73,Academics

As a full-time student, I cannot afford living in IRVINE where everything is catered towards those with high-paying fancy jobs. Even if I was working as part timer, I would still be struggling to afford stuff sometimes especially in this economy. I thought that‚Äôs why FAFSA and student loan was there for. I thought they were supposed to HELP students out, not delaying delaying delaying delaying to the point where now I have to worry about my status as a student. 

I think i‚Äôve been waiting long enough that at this point i feel like they are not planning to give us any money this quarter.

The few times I've tried looking inside, it looked like storage with boxes and Zotbot charging stations. It doesn't really make sense to have the facilities there and not use them. Does anyone want to petition to turn that space into another Java City/coffee spot that is actually open late-night (like Denny's and Norms late-night kinda deal)? I'm kinda tired of never having a spot to go to after 10 pm since everything closes super early at UTC; Irvine company definitely hates the idea of being a college town. Also, it's not that I need coffee super late all the time, but having the choice and space to go late at night would be nice.

After doing EXACTLY what she told me, I woke up today with a blank canvas, dropped from all my classes, and no access to web reg. Furthermore, because financial aid loves to screw people over, they also took the cherry on top by revoking access to web reg, and this is despite my zot account specifically saying I have no more outstanding dues. Especially due to the extended financial aid deadlines, as well as the period past when I can add or drop classes, what are some steps I can take to ensure I can re enroll in my classes and be back on track?

At first she seems super sweet and we had lots of similar interests as we both were biosci majors and she had A LOT of things in common with me. Firstly, she started creating lots of white lies.

Also why is UCI giving me just 5 days to decide to take out loans that might affect my whole financial situation in the future, and also not giving me time to appeal or ask for the significant change of the amount of money I need to attend this school.

1e52fsz,UCI,Here are some tips for freshman/transfers,"Tips
1. Do not be scared to talk to 2nd to 5th years. They are usually nice but stay away from certain men because they are some creeps who are trying to get with freshmen. 

2. Never disclosed your financial situation with anyone. It better for people not to know.

3. Make friends with other freshman or transfers they are the easiest people to be friends with starting off. 

4. Do not be scared to switch majors. Certain majors are hard and have unnecessary classes. Example Bio, if you don‚Äôt like physic switch to Public Health science ( I am bias about public health but in reality Public health science and policy majors are more flexible then Bio, yall can s**k it bio majors)

5. Go to events, mostly if your living on campus they are fun. 

6. Go to parties or host one and invite random people. Socialize with others, make connections.

7. Work study only: Apply around August/September for on campus jobs. They are relatively easy and while the interviews are scary there is a big chance they will hired you. (It could also count as an internship fyi depending where you work) 

8. You will feel lonely and depressed first quarter maybe second quarter and that‚Äôs alright but you will find people eventually, interact with people on class discord or in person. Tho tbh if you aren‚Äôt social you shouldn‚Äôt complain about not having friends. (If you can‚Äôt find friends, you might the issues and I am sorry to said this but sometimes you gotta change and that‚Äôs up to u) 

9. Freshman only: Do not date seniors or juniors (maybe some juniors are alright) They will take advantage of your naiveness and innocences. If a 21+ year old dude wants to date a freshly 18 year old girl idk that‚Äôs kinda icky and the reverse as well. Now if yall want to date them that‚Äôs on yall, I just wanna to safe yall from a inevitable heartbreak. 

10. Last tip: have fun, enjoy being in college and congrats on being almost an adult. But definitely enjoy it because after college is basically real life even if you go to grad school.",-0.43,Academics

1fhtem7,UCI,Questions about aid,"Hi Guys! I went to aid office today and asked majority of everything on everyone‚Äôs mind. Let‚Äôs me know if you have any questions in the comments and I‚Äôll try my best to rephrase the staffs response!

Important key details!

- The chance of you actually getting off hold is 1 in a 1,000. Staff said they don‚Äôt have enough workers to keep up with calls and HIGHLY recommend to do walk-ins considering not a lot of people are taking the opportunity(empty majority of the day)and they can actually fully assist you.

- Due to the delays, you don‚Äôt need an appointment right now to visit the aid office currently (take the opportunity)

- The new deadline is Oct 15(For those who are receiving Aid, and are waiting on their package)

- Worst case scenario, you don‚Äôt have your aid package by the new deadline. You can visit the office and tell them the situation and they will add back your classes because it‚Äôs their fault.

- You do NOT need to do anything on the 3rd step of loans. Those will be pending through the year incase you want to take out the loans but if you don‚Äôt just leave them be, it won‚Äôt affect you.

- When you accept your award offer, you are only accepting the aid given to you, not including the loans.

- Aid office is now opening (for now due to delay) new hours from 9am-7pm Mon-Friday

- Middle Class Scholarship (if emailed about eligibility) has yet been released due to staff still not receiving their rosters of those who will get qualify, should be released next month.

1ddkx11,UCI,Your Commencement FAQ answered,"I thought I'd post my own FAQ on Commencement to compliment the official [Commencement FAQ](https://commencement.uci.edu/faqs/)

**What is going to happen at the ceremony?**

You process in from the tennis courts into the Bren. You have to go down two sets of fairly steep and kind of dark stairs into the Bren so be prepared for that if you're wearing heels. Commencement staff will seat you into rows. You listen to a few speeches.  You do the tassel turning thing. Commencement staff will pull graduates from the Bren floor to have your name called across the stage. Before that you get your photo taken with Peter. Your name is called and you cross the stage. You shake your Dean's hand. Take another photo with them. You exit the stage and you sit back down in roughly the same seat. You process out of the Bren at the end. See [one of last year's ceremonies](https://youtu.be/Bth4TIBFdzk?t=961).

**What do I do to check in?**

See the [Commencement FAQ](https://commencement.uci.edu/grad-checklist/). You need your QR code from registration and a photo ID. Once you check in, you get a card with your name on it. Hang on to the card as you will hand it over on stage.

**I lost/forgot my tassel, cap, and gown!**

The Alumni Association has a tent in the check-in area where you can buy a replacement. They only take credit cards though.

**My Mom wants to give me a flower lei after I checked in, can she come in and give it to me?**

No, parents are not allowed past the security fence. She can be on the other side though. Have her call you and you can go over and get it over the fence. If you leave the security area, you have to get screened again.

**What order is the line up? Is it alphabetical?**

There is no order to the line up. You just line up in two lines.

Masters and Bachelor grads do line up separately though. Masters go into the Bren before the Bachelors so they group the Masters separately.

**Is line up by major?**

No, there's no order to the line up. However, if you are in one of the dual school ceremonies like the Sunday 5:00 PM Social Ecology and Humanities, you do line up by school.

**I don't know what to do!**

Don't worry, there are plenty of Commencement staff to get you through it. And it is pretty obvious what to do once you're there with everyone else. Just follow the person in front of you.

**Can I sit with my friends?**

Yes. When you line up at the tennis courts, line up in the same side with your friends in a group. When you get down to the floor of the Bren, you are likely going to be in the same row together.

**What if I have no friends?**

Ouch. Well, you do now because you're going to be sitting next to a stranger for the next hour and forty-five minutes. Introduce yourself!

**Is there assigned seats for grads?**

Nope. Remember what I said about no order to the line up?  Therefore, no order to the seats.  The Commencement staff on the Bren floor will seat you in rows after you process in.

**I want to sit on the same side of the Bren as my parents.**

Look at the [seating map](https://commencement.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/Bren-Commencement-Accessible_Seating_Map.pdf). If your parents are sitting in sections 101-110, you want to be in Section A. If they are in sections 113-122, you want Section B.  When you line up at the tennis courts, if you want Section A, line up on the right-hand line. If you want Section B, line up on the left-hand line.

**Will I be on stage first or last?**

They start bringing people up from the back of the Bren. If you line up at the tennis courts towards the front, you will end up closer to the stage, but on stage towards the end of the ceremony. If you line up at the end of the line, you will be in the back of the Bren and on stage earlier.

**Can I bring my phone/purse onto the stage?**

Yes. You can also leave stuff on your chair. After you cross the stage when your name is called, you go back to roughly the same seat you were in before. Just remember which side of the Bren you were sitting on so you got back to the same seat. However, remember that your perspective changes: Look at the [seating map](https://commencement.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/Bren-Commencement-Accessible_Seating_Map.pdf). If you're sitting in Section A, it looks like you're on the right side, but when you come down off the stage, Section A is on your left.

**I've got an unusual pronunciation to my name. Will the speaker mess it up?**

No. Just before you cross the stage, you hand your check-in card to the speaker with your name. You can say your name to them beforehand so they get the pronunciation correct.

**Are there bathrooms at the Bren once I get down there? :potty dance:**

Yes, head towards the back and the Commencement staff will show you.

**Is it *really* an hour and 45 minutes or they lying and it's shorter/longer? I've got lunch/dinner reservations.**

Yes, it really is that long. Things move fast. When you leave though, factor in that is going to be really crowded. You have everyone leaving all at once. You have to meet up with your family, walk back to the parking lot, and then deal with the traffic. So if you're at the 5:00 PM ceremony, you better not make reservations at 7:00 PM unless those reservations are at In-N-Out or Chick-fil-A at UTC because you're not going to make it.

**Can I leave early?**

No, that's rude!

**How to I find my parents after the ceremony?**

It's really crowded outside the Bren when everyone leaves. Try to setup a spot beforehand to meet like by a specific tree or whatever.

**What should I wear?**

Clothes? Some dress fancy, some are super casual. Wear what you want. Nobody is going to care one way or another. In your cap and gown, you all look the same.

**Can I decorate my cap?**

Sure! Just note though that when you put on the cap, it does have a front and back side fit even though it's square. Make sure you decorate so that whatever you are doing is right side up on your head. Be creative. Patrick studying Wumbology is always cute. Or maybe Bluey?

**Will they be streaming the ceremonies?**

Yes, it should be linked on the [Commencement website](https://commencement.uci.edu/) on the day of the ceremony. Upcoming links are already on the [UCI Media YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@UCIMedia/streams).

**How much is parking? Can my parents use my parking permit?**

[Parking is free during Commencement.](https://commencement.uci.edu/directions-parking/) You don't need a permit or pay for it. Commencement is one of those rare times that parking is free.

**Do you have any other tips?**

* Wear comfy shoes

* If it's hot, you don't have to wear your cap and gown at the tennis courts all the time. You can take it off and then put it on just before you start walking in. The cap and gown can get hot, so if it's hot that day, be careful and don't pass out. There's no shade at the tennis courts.

* Have fun! Don't fret.

1fkcq6x,UCI,Financial Aid and UC Regents,"Hi everyone,
I've been seeing a lot of concerns about financial aid, and as a 4th year financial aid recipient, I feel the same way as many of you. It's absolutely frustrating that we have been left in this limbo, that study abroad students are yet to recieve funds despite having started over a month ago,  that people are losing housing, and have to contemplate dropping school for a year and that we don't know when tuition will be covered, much less disbursed. With that being said, I came to the regents meeting today and there was not one UCI student, parent or Alumni who spoke on financial aid. As a collective, we need to bring these issues up and press them for answers, we need to keep our campus accountable. 
I was able to speak with one of the Regents and this was the first they heard of it. They asked one of the staff to try and include this on the agenda for tomorrow's meeting so this can be discussed. However, i'm just one UCI student, and tomorow they are going to talk about this  topic with a room full of Chancellors, and staff that will only share their side of the story. Today there were a few speakers, only about 25 signed up for public comment and about 18 actually spoke. I urge you all to sign on for tommorow. I know the deadline has passed, but when its slow, they take more people. You can also send letters and they will recieve them as well. But we need to have our voices heard tommorow, not just our administrations. Flood their inboxes, email ucop, and sign on for tommorow.

This should never even be a thought a college student have, wanting to drop out because they simply cannot afford the upcoming school year, yet here we are. And coming from an immigrant family who have worked their asses off for me to be able to come here and attend these supposedly high end schools and make a good living it is incredibly frustrating to see that they clearly do not care about their students one bit. They keep sending out these updates, posting them on their websites which nobody would‚Äôve seen if we weren‚Äôt all in a panic checking every five minutes lately, and keep trying to reassure us everything will be fine while keeping the crucial details all in the dark. How am I supposed to trust that I won‚Äôt be drop from my classes when my package have been constantly changing and there‚Äôs a ‚Äú17 hours wait time‚Äù to even get a hold of a real human being? And that‚Äôs not even guaranteeing that they can help! And since I now have my packages, does that mean I‚Äôm not longer protected from my class drop? Why aren‚Äôt they saying anything about this? So many have gotten theirs and it‚Äôs all sort of messed up. Are we screwed? My website aren‚Äôt even working properly. I keep seeing people being able to access their aids and at least accept their offers but I genuinely do *not* have the option whatsoever. The second step being a constant blank with ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no reward pending‚Äù. And of course I can‚Äôt reach anyone to ask what the hell is going on because, again, no agent is available.

Honestly it‚Äôs been a mess since Fafsa decided to create this ‚Äúnew form‚Äù and the school decided to follow suit for whatever reason. It was working fine before. Why fix what wasn‚Äôt even broken? And if they had wanted a new format so bad they should‚Äôve made sure to bug test it *thoroughly* before releasing everything prematurely and plunging everyone into a frenzy with them. The old Fafsa was fine. Myaid was fine. We used to be able to go in and accept or decline within thirty seconds. It *should* be this easy. But now we are 5 days away from our fee deadline in which 2 of those days they won‚Äôt even be available since it‚Äôs not a business day.

I should not be driven to consider dropping out of the university I‚Äôve wanted to go to since grade school. Or any other university for that matter. No student should be force to abandon education simply because they are worried their school cannot help them cover their expenses.

i have a lot of scarring on my face, arms, legs, and back from skin picking and despite me saying that it was all psychological, that i am currently receiving counselling and am medicated, and that i would rather talk about what i was actually there for (once again, my wrist was purple) i wound up with a derm referral. i had to argue for the doctor to look at my wrist and not my scars. won't use quotations because i can't remember exactly what she said (i also have an anxiety disorder so at this point i was freaking out) but it was something along the lines of 'you have such a pretty face and body, we just need to fix your skin' which felt very underhanded. out of the 10 minutes the doctor was in the room with me (probably less tbh) id say MAYBE a minute was spent looking at my wrist. and once again, i had to argue for it! all of her suggestions for my skin picking were so... base level, too. it was a bit insulting lol.

1ct9a2c,UCI,"Coward Howard's Corruption, Incompetence, and Callous","No matter your opinion on what is happening in Israel, what happened today transcends that conflict and shows us the deadly combination of corruption, incompetence, and callous rife in UC Irvine's administration.

At 4:55pm UC Irvine Twitter Tweeted:

&gt;Campus update: At approximately 2:30 p.m. a group of several hundred protestors entered the Physical Sciences Lecture Hall on the UC Irvine campus and began surrounding the building

This report that ""several hundred protestors entered the Physical Sciences Lecture Hall on the UC Irvine campus"" was used as justification for deploying an overwhelming police force. However, as seen in the tweet linked below (including live video footage published by Fox News), when the police entered the lecture hall, they found it empty and clean. There was no evidence of individuals present in the building, much less blockading themselves inside.

[https://x.com/KManleySci/status/1790958003979743738](https://x.com/KManleySci/status/1790958003979743738)

At 10:57 PM, Fraudman Gillman graced us with one of his long-ass letters in which he claimed:

&gt;""The protesters orchestrated a swift departure from their encampment. In a coordinated fashion they moved out of the encampment to the Physical Sciences Lecture Hall, where a small group barricaded themselves in, supported by a large group of community members who had gathered for a scheduled rally.

In doing so, he is again attempting to justify the disproportionate deployment of police force that we, as Americans, have deluded ourselves into believing is only characteristic of authoritarian and fascist governments abroad.

Finally, at 11:19 PM, UC Irvine tweeted (in response to the previously mentioned tweet):

&gt;\* Correction: At approximately 2:30 p.m. several protestors surrounded the Physical Sciences Lecture Hall on the UC Irvine campus.

This verifies that the protesters did not enter the building.

Chomsky wrote ""Any dictator would admire the uniformity and obedience of the U.S. media."" and Coward Howard understands this. By swiftly pushing a false narrative, before the truth is allowed to settle, he has effectively manipulated public perception and steered the narrative to align with his agenda. This tactic, known as ""manufacturing consent,"" ensures that dissenting voices are drowned out and critical thinking is suppressed. The immediate bombardment of misleading information creates a reality where questioning the official story becomes not only difficult but also socially and politically costly.

1dblzad,UCI,Might be dropped from UCI,"This is gonna be a long read and a bit personal, but I‚Äôd really appreciate receiving any advice. I‚Äôm at my wits end.

I‚Äôm currently at the end of my second year as an undecided student and will be dropped from UCI if I don‚Äôt declare into my intended major (public health sciences) by the end of this spring. The thing is, I don‚Äôt think I will be able to do that since I‚Äôm probably going to pass only half of the classes I took this quarter. I‚Äôd be exceeding the 90 unit cap, so most likely I will have to leave school. If by some miracle that doesn‚Äôt happen, then I‚Äôm thinking of possibly leaving either way.
 
In the two years I‚Äôve been here, I‚Äôve honestly struggled so much and my grades have definitely shown for it. I‚Äôm first gen and low income, so I feel like I was severely underprepared when coming to a big university like this. I didn‚Äôt know there was resources for students like me until a few months ago, so I wasn‚Äôt able to take advantage of things that may have helped me a lot sooner. On top of that, I‚Äôve had to deal with even more stressors from working, my mental &amp; physical health, one of my parents being re-incarcerated, my other parent &amp; siblings becoming homeless, etc. I understand that everyone has their own problems to deal with, but unfortunately I‚Äôm not one of those people that handles theirs so well. 

I originally wanted to go to PA or OT school after getting my bachelors, but I don‚Äôt think grad school is even going to be an option for me anymore considering I won‚Äôt be a competitive enough applicant. My GPA has made me start to rethink everything and wonder if I should even continue to pursue this degree anymore. 

If I do end up having to leave school, I obviously don‚Äôt want to just give up. I would still like to continue my education somewhere else. But I don‚Äôt know if a science degree would be worth it given my horrible grades and low GPA (less than 3.0). I wish I could start all over again. I just feel so torn and like I‚Äôve completely failed myself &amp; ruined any chances I have of bettering my future. 

Would I even be able to go to college somewhere else with how bad my grades are? Should I pursue a different degree and change my career plans? I‚Äôve always had a genuine interest for designing walkable cities &amp; infrastructure, so I wouldn‚Äôt mind switching to something like civil engineering. Would I even be able to do that??  How would my GPA here affect my GPA elsewhere? Can I completely start my degree over or am I stuck with this fuck up forever? 

I‚Äôm feeling very hopeless right now and like I‚Äôve hit a new low point in my life. I‚Äôm really sad and disappointed in myself. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

TLDR: Might have to drop out of school because of low GPA. I don‚Äôt know if I should give up on my degree or continue pursuing education somewhere else. I don‚Äôt know if I should change my career plans either. I‚Äôm just really lost",-0.83,Mental Health

I don't want to be rude, but seriously, some of you need to think about how your decisions affect others. I know a lot of people personally and on this reddit page who didn't get housing, I barely got housing (literally got my offer about 2 weeks ago), and someone seriously can't make the 5 minute drive/walk to campus?

1e3hqig,UCI,Admission may be rescinded,"Soooo... long story short. I'm 30 years old and a first-generation college student. I just completed my AA after a very long and chaotic 13 years in/ and out of CC. 

Juggling full-time work, and losing multiple family members (including my dad) in the span of 4 months (in 2021)  affected my ability to stay in school and do well. 

Finally, in 2023 (for the first time in my life) with the support of my boyfriend, I was able to quit my job and go back to school full time. 

SO I did just that. I spent the last year in CC as a full-time student, got GREAT grades, (finished with a 3.6 GPA) and was nominated by a professor to attend a Chicano Studies Conference, and made the Full Time Honors Dean List during my last semester. 

When it came time to apply for Transfer, I spent a lot of time in the transfer center. This process of applying was very overwhelming for me as it was my first time doing so. 

  
Because my College transcripts date back to 2012, it was a bit of a challenge to report all of my coursework. TBH, I was not the best student so I had some grades that don't reflect the student I am today. 

Luckily, I was able to request academic renewal on some of my classes to help clean up my transcripts... but there are some FW's from old CC's I went to that I couldn't fix. As well as 2 F's I got in two film classes a few months after my Dad passed. 

When I applied to UC's and Cal States, I was advised to leave out the classes that were not relevant to my major and to explain in my personal statements about the tragedies I went through in life that would provide insight into why these grades looked like this. 

I also reiterated that my most recent grades are a reflection of the new and improved and most importantly focused student I am today. 

To my surprise, I was accepted to every school I applied to- except UCLA. 

I happily decided on UCI, and my partner and I are moving into our on-campus apartment literally a month from today (we already paid our first months rent). 

All this to say, two days ago I got an e-mail from admissions stating that my transcripts don't accurately reflect my application and that I have 7 days to explain the discrepancies. 

An admissions committee will be reviewing my application to decide whether i'll be a UCI student or not. I feel absolutely gutted. As the first in my family to attend college, as the oldest sister to my 4 siblings, as a daughter to a widow... I just want to make my family and most importantly myself proud. 

My academic journey has been hard, but being accepted to UCI has been the most important and meaningful thing that has happened to me since my dad's passing. 

I am currently writing an extensive, but detailed letter to the admissions committee, explaining the discrepancies and providing attachments- the first being my Full Time Honors Dean List e-mail and the second is a Letter of Recommendation from the CC professor I mentioned above. 

I guess my question is- can anyone offer any insight on this? How strict is the admissions committee? Has anyone received this scary email, but didn't get their admission revoked after all? 

I forgot to mention that I also got a full ride from FAFSA for UCI. All of the other school offers have already passed the deadline, and my boyfriend and I are packing as I type. 

Someone, please help me ease my worried mind.

I try to take days to rest and regain mental health, but it's hard to do when school keeps bombarding me with assignments. I keep telling myself to just ""push through tonight!"" Or ""push through tomorrow!"" but I've never been so tired, my eye bags have never been deeper, and I've never felt so hopeless.

1fczgjf,UCI,Why will they not extend/remove the fee deadline?,"I understand that UCI has sent out notifications that our classes will not be dropped if we are experiencing issues with financial aid. But rather than putting an individual mark or note on our Zot Accounts to ensure that we specifically will be exempt from the deadline, all they've said is ""We know who needs what, trust us."" Just like we were supposed to trust that our financial aid would be applied by the 30th? Or like how we were supposed to receive our financial aid packages by last Friday? And then they have also told us to not reach out for reassurance that we are on the exempt list. It is completely unfair for them to think that we should have ANY trust in the blatantly horrid and unorganized system they are using. 

In addition, I've just learned that I have a $35 Tech related charge on my account that was originally due 6/20 and is now added to my total amount due by 9/16. I can't make a payment for this charge separately, so now I'm concerned that because of this fee my classes will be dropped since it's not related to my tuition and will remain unpaid until I get my financial aid.

I simply don't understand why UCI is still enforcing a deadline that they can't meet themselves. This is no way directed at the individual employees who are currently swamped with trying to fix this mess. My issues are with the UCI Financial Aid leaders who have failed to provide adequate corrective measures or effective means of reassurance for students.",-0.83,Politics

- financial aid
- housing crisis
- protests
- TA strike punishment
- parking 

I know some of these issues are pretty common around college campuses, but what‚Äôs to say we can‚Äôt fix these common issues? As far as I‚Äôm concerned, UCI has way more than enough to fight these concerns, but would rather use that money literally anywhere but their own students.

I hope the shit I saw isn't set in stone, bc tell me why there are exactly $0 in the non-school related grants section?? Last year, my tuition was completely covered by financial aid. nothing significant has changed since then (living expenses, annual household income, etc.) and this just feels like a massive 'fuck you' to me and all the rest of you guys complaining about the same thing.

you would think with literally every other UC dispersing FAFSA summaries, UCI would have their shit together. but apparently not! the way they're handling this situation would be laughable if it wasn't for the literal hundreds of students they are massively fucking over right now. why haven't they sent out any emails clarifying common questions i'm sure their office is being asked over and over again? where is the reassurance that financial aid offers are accurate and can support students' (esp out of state) tuition costs? their new portal (also the way they insist on slapping ""zot"" onto everything makes me sick i hate this spiritless ass school) is shitty and buggy and confusing. they really expect us to believe that our classes won't be dropped/there'll be no repercussions for not paying by the fee deadline after they've done literally nothing to prove that we should trust what they say.

mixed messages are being spread everywhere on this reddit and hmm yea maybe i could try reaching out to them for direct clarification, but from what I heard the office isn't really taking calls and they're being super distant and cold. they're leaving us to figure out what to do all by ourselves, literally DAYS before the fee deadline and dont gaf! sick of this fr!!

The Chancellor's house is way up California street but if you get there early enough he's usually handing out Nerd Ropes!

Wharton and Mistral have some good spots and are easy to walk through as they connect.

The big candy neighborhood is off Anteater, massive numbers of kids although I'm not sure how they feel about teenagers. Worth a shot.

If you drive through some of the older neighborhoods and see a lit up house all by itself, those lonely folks will probably be delighted to see you and hand you all their candy! It's almost like you're doing a good deed.

It's true that some people don't think older students shouldn't be out. Boo. Just say thank you anyway, don't let it ruin your night.

People have gone to trouble getting ready for trick or treaters, you have to do your part in return. Make an effort at a costume and be exceedingly polite.

Maybe if you talk to me, you won‚Äôt find me so scary that you feel the need to call the cops.

I tried to introduce myself because I could hear you in your apartment. I mean, we always hear you because you‚Äôre so loud. It sounds like you‚Äôre dropping weights on the floor or moving furniture throughout the night. Since you didn‚Äôt open the door, I left a note stating that I‚Äôm your downstairs neighbor and that I had called maintenance because water was overflowing into our kitchen sink every time you used yours. Maintenance asked me to go up and request that you not use your sink while they sent someone out for an emergency maintenance request.

I was hesitant to knock because I know what I look like: a big Hispanic guy who maybe doesn‚Äôt seem like he belongs at UCLA. I get looks that say as much on South Campus all the time. I figured this might be your response, but I thought I‚Äôd give you the benefit of the doubt. As soon as I came back in, I told my wife, ‚ÄúYou know what? I think they‚Äôre going to call the cops on me.‚Äù

Some might ask why my wife didn‚Äôt go instead. Maybe she would seem less threatening. But why should we have to live like that? My first instinct was to say a big FU to you, but I know that‚Äôs not the best response. Just know that calling the cops could have ended badly for me.

You didn‚Äôt have to open the door. You could‚Äôve just asked what I wanted. I understand not wanting to open the door to a stranger‚ÄîI might not, either. But jumping straight to calling the cops? Luckily, UCPD contacted after-hours maintenance, and they called me to let me know you‚Äôd called them. They asked me not to go up anymore because you were really scared.

I am embarrassed that our beautiful campus has become the staging ground for pitched battles to be fought between non-student agitators, co-opting authentic student sentiment in the name of pushing an agenda. 

Most of all, I am embarrassed by the level of discourse I'm witnessing between members of the student body.

1cjck8s,ucla,Let's talk about student influencer Eli Tsives,"Eli Tsives has done the rounds on all the national news networks, so I think talking about him is fair game and not doxxing since he has chosen to become a public figure. If you claim to be an influencer and then appear on several national television channels to talk about an issue, speak at rallies in front of thousands of people, create content that is watched by millions, you should be open to discuss. Just like Christian Walker.

He produced intentional ragebait which fomented the violent attack through false narratives. The protestors weren't singling out Jewish students in particular, they were blocking anyone who wasn't a part of the encampment. But Eli made it seem that way. He knew what he was doing. He did it on purpose knowing he could spin it as an ""anti-Jewish"" protest, which it is was NOT. Eli Tsives was totally complicit in inviting violence to our campus. Those videos got millions of views on twitter, and probably just as many on other platforms.

You can tell how planned and coordinated the recording of that footage was.

The 30 year-old (non-student) violent psychos who descended upon our campus to attack students with metal rods, wooden sticks, metal barricades, explosive fireworks, mace, lazers, punches, kicks, etc, even cited this fallacious narrative during their attack. One of the men yelled out ""[You wanna block Jewish kids!? We're fighting back, bitch!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1chnn5l/these_counterprotestors_are_absolutely_unhinged/)"" as they attacked students. This was the rage Eli wanted. Dozens of students were hospitalized, and with the level of violence we saw unfold, some could've been killed.

The picture he painted was disingenuous, misleading, and portrayed in bad faith. It put students in danger when it encouraged and motivated the formation of an angry violent mob. In my opinion, Eli Tsives is partly responsible for the violence.

All I have to say is shame on him.

Eli is also currently running for a position on USAC as a gen rep. Please don't allow someone like this to represent students.",-0.83,Politics

Let me explain because I understand this may seem like an overreaction, considering the podcast is popular at the moment. But when I say he doesnt stop watching it, I mean it. Every waking hour in my room, I hear hear the wretched sound of JoJo Siwa on last week‚Äôs video. He literally LOOPS it for hours on end while hes studying, eating, sleeping, EVERYTHING. It‚Äôs been like this for the last week or two ever since I sent him a stupid tiktok, and he discovered what it was. He even admitted he puts his phone on the ground in the communal dorm bathrooms to watch it. The worst part however, is not the video, for I can tune that out with headphones, but the references when Im just existing around the dorm or around school. Ex) I hear this stupid joke as soon as I walk in the dorm or wake up EVERYDAY, this morning included. It goes like, ‚Äúhawk 1: wheres hawk 3?, hawk 2: uhhh‚Äù and then he sits there and asks if I get it until I say yes, ITS INFURIATING. Last night he said, what if when you pray, you say hawkletuah, instead of hallelujah and I just about blew my brains out. And dont get me started on a few days back when we passed by each other around campus while I was rushing to a class, and he decided it would be best to walk with me and deliver some joke about how his grandma died for 43 minutes and somehow came back to life because of talk tuah, what does that even mean? I finally had enough of this behavior this morning when I was on a phone call with my friend from home (outside the dorm room) and he found me in the lounge, and TOOK my PHONE to play the new episode of talk tuah at full volume + ran away with it.

1ctepn9,ucla,Dear Students (from a UCLA Faculty Member),"Dear UCLA students and community members,

On April 30/May 1 a violent mob came to campus and attacked students and employees of UCLA in the Palestine Solidarity Encampment. Yesterday CNN had a segment about this attack, which is surreal and horrifying:¬†[https://twitter.com/KyungLahCNN/status/1790908711898165639](https://twitter.com/KyungLahCNN/status/1790908711898165639).¬†

There is also a powerful statement from medics who worked at the encampment, [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rW7zccGj8tdtYWUw1ORZe0BmsLvadGyQ/view?usp=drive\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rW7zccGj8tdtYWUw1ORZe0BmsLvadGyQ/view?usp=drive_link). According to medics, ""more than 150 students were assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace...At least 25 injured encampment members were escorted or driven in private vehicles to local emergency rooms to ensure they received vital medical care for blunt-force head traumas, fractures, severe lacerations, and chemical-induced injuries.""¬†

To date, no one has been arrested for harming and terrorizing our community on April 30/May 1. Instead, hundreds of people peacefully protesting a genocide in Gaza were arrested in a violent police raid the following night, May 1/May 2. Medics at the encampment claim ""more than a dozen students were evaluated for rubber bullet injuries causing golf ball-sized contusions, potential bone fractures, and severe lacerations...At least 15 encampment members required prompt emergency services."" Cal Matters (https://calmatters.org/justice/2024/05/ucla-protest-palestine-police/) and the American Friends Service Committee (https://afsc.org/newsroom/officers-who-fired-ucla-students-broke-state-law) claim that California Highway Patrol violated the law by shooting projectiles at people's eye level and into crowds.

I was among the hundreds of peaceful protestors arrested that night/morning, put in handcuffs in front of Haines Hall. I hope others will join me in resisting the repression at UCLA and protesting the genocide in Gaza.

Hidden in this flyer, though, is the sentence ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the ongoing US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine‚Äù 

When I asked one of the members to expand on this, they expressed how they believe Ukraine is a false democracy and should be under Russian rule, as it was during the formation of the Soviet Union. 

However you feel about socialism or the war in Palestine: fine. But please seriously reconsider associating with this group if you care about the people of Ukraine and the inherent freedom that every human on this Earth deserves. Personally, this line of thinking is absolutely ridiculous and I would never want to associate with people who support Russia in this war.

1cj06o1,ucla,Opinion on Recent Encampment Protests (idgaf about your opinion on the war),"My friends and I are UCLA undergrads who are relatively uninvolved in any of the recent protests. As STEM majors, we are incapable of making any real commentary, connections, or opinions on anything related to the war in Gaza (the first half was a joke). However, we all had similar opinions about the recent encampment and removal:

**1. The student encampments were quite undisruptive and peaceful for about a week.**

Say what you will, but I honestly thought that the marching protests throughout the year were a lot more disruptive than this one. I distinctly remember being disgusted when ppl were literally protesting on Bruin Day, ruining a lot of first impressions of UCLA for prospective students. That being said, there simply is no comparison with those marches and these recent encampments. We were free to walk AROUND the lawn or enter through the OPPOSITE side of the Royce/Powell, until the administration added barriers (at least as I am aware). I'd also say that this demonstration was a lot cleaner than at least the one at Columbia University, and overall the school was relatively understanding and did good to keep the peace. I can't comment on antisemitism (except that it's bad, no shit), but I can assure you that any student, regardless of background, could go on with their life and study as normal if they didn't involve themselves.

**2. This changed with the non-school-affiliated protestors and counter-protestors.**

I know this is probably unrealistic, but I kind of wish the administration did something like keep the non-affiliated people out of the lawn or related area. Like maybe do a routine check for student IDs, to make sure that the make-up of protestors and counter-protestors is mainly students at UCLA. Obviously, this would have been really difficult to implement, and over the past week more of these non-affiliates started trickling into the main lawn, which eventually spiraled down into the violence.

**3. The violence on the night of 4/30-5/1 was largely perpetuated by the counter-protestors.**

Most news sources imply that the violence at UCLA was perpetuated largely by both sides or largely by the encamped protestors. Having watched the ABC helicopter broadcast, I would go as far to say that the violence was almost exclusively caused by counter-protestors. Yes, the encampment protestors likely shouted some inflammatory remarks and started trying to colonize more of the lawn, but for 4 hours the only things I saw on the ABC helicopter broadcast were:

* Tear gas being thrown around like hot potato on both sides
* Counter-protestors pulling out the wall.
* Counter-protestors throwing a ton of harmful debris into the encampment
* Counter-protestors shooting at least two fireworks onto the encampment
* Counter-protestors beating up protestors trying to leave the encampment

Why 4 hours? Because

**4. The administration overseeing the police failed the student body, and was clearly partisan.**

This is what we don't fucking understand. The police should have stopped the violence when it started. Instead, they were parked at the Chick-Fi-La for a good amount of time and were just chilling and watching as the counter-protestors, many of them not school-affiliated, violently sieged the encampment. And instead of ARRESTING these violent counter-protestors, they instead just let them go scot-free, and instead proceed to act as the second wave of the siege to destroy the encampment and arrest the protestors.

It is clear that whoever oversaw the police favored the violence of counter-protestors over the protection of students in the encampment. It is clear that they at best wanted the protestors out and at worst wanted to selectively suppress one set of opinions, and instead of being responsible at the onset and making themselves accountable for the removal, they let the counter-protestors run loose for a whole 4 hours.

And for this violence, the encampment is somehow blamed instead of the counter-protestors, and thus its removal is justified??? If you were peacefully protesting during the 1960s Civil Rights movement, and then some racist folk started violently attacking you, is it fair that the city council should blame you for inciting violence and then forcibly disperse your demonstration? It's flawed logic, to put it lightly.

Then you have 5/1 and 5/2, where many students tried, but failed, to prevent the encampment from being eradicated by this partisan application of police (who, by the way, are using flashbangs and rubber bullets against students just standing their ground), and it's honestly just such a futile display that makes us question whether the government, media, or administration actually care about our safety, wellbeing, or constitutional rights.

**5. Bullshit Aftermath**

The way the U.S. media have portrayed this event has been pure and utter bullshit. Their narratives imply that the encamped protestors incited significant violence, and that these encampments caused a great deal of duress to students. They did not. In fact, many students are sympathetic to acts of peaceful student-led demonstration, even while their views on the war in Gaza may differ. And almost everyone I've met is happy that their midterms are now delayed. As for class cancellations, there's this crazy thing called distance learning that we've only gotten used to for like, 3 years. RIP seminars and labs tho. This shit will end by next Monday, even so.

Peaceful student-led demonstrations are an integral part of campus tradition and are protected by the First Amendment, and it's simply such a shame that the administration and the media misrepresent and actively suppress it while letting violent counter-protestors who pose an active threat to student safety run wild. Now lawmakers are using the narrative of violent protest to justify new limitations to freedom of speech and expression... So take that as you will.",-0.43,Politics

1czpto1,ucla,Chi Alpha Delta Hazing Expos√© - Complete List of Hazing Rituals,"Hi all! So this expos√© was actually shared a few years ago on this subreddit by someone else, and from what I know it REALLY pissed Chi Alpha Delta at UCLA off. It was a big internal thing and there was an investigation to find out who the mole was. They never found out. BUT, I feel that it should be shared again so that the fresh cohort of admits gets a chance to learn the nature of certain sororities. I'm an outgoing senior, and I can attest to these things actually happening because my girlfriend went through these things. And as I'm about to graduate, I learned that they're STILL doing a lot of this stuff. So I wanted people to know before they thought of joining.

**Important!** Keep an eye out for new sock puppet accounts coming in here to discredit all of this. Also watch out for mass downvotes. They'll definitely try to bury this thread. That's how they operate.

1hq1h36,ucla,Alumni here. Wow Westwood is even more depressing nowadays,"Class of 2016 here. I've driven/rode my bike through the Westwood Village many times so I've noticed certain businesses pop up and disappear but this is the first time in a while I walked around in a while and it's sad to see the state of Westwood right now with all the vacant storefronts.

The 2 movie theaters seemed closed down and literally half the storefronts on Weyburn between Broxton and Westwood  had ""for lease"" signs up. I heard Stan's Donuts closed a while ago and what seemed to be the replacement for it also recently closed? Boba Time is gone, that mediocore ramen place I remember going to my first day of living on the Hill looks like it's recently closed. That huge space Meat Fresh had looks closed for a while. Even that dumb 7-11 and Sur La Table spots are empty. Not sure how Corner Bakery is still around. Koala Tea Cafe, 800 Degrees, and TLT Food are gone and I guess that spot where Noodle World used to be is still vacant after 8-9 years. The Ralph's used to probably be the nicest one in LA, with the biggest hot food bar I've ever seen in any grocery store. They even had a sushi station and a bar that served beer flights. Gone and now there's a Wing Stop? 

I'm glad to see Fat Sal's, Gushi, Bella Pita, Mr Noodle, Diddy Reese, Barney's Beanery, Pinches Tacos, Boiling Crab, and I guess Rocco's still around. RIP Ohara's and Sepis. 

I know I'm missing countless other places that are long gone and it's currently winter break so business is bound to be slow. Do current students still like to go down and hang out in the village anymore? We definitely had our share of vacant storefronts when I was attending but it's really hard to see it turning around anytime soon.",-0.73,Social

1fo1nh6,ucla,Let‚Äôs have a discussion about this line in my grad orientation,"First, a few things to start off with:
I am an Asian male, did my undergrad here and coming back for my masters.
I understand the racial disparity in police interactions and within the police and prison system as a whole. I am not denying that.
I am not angry or necessarily trying to get this changed, it just made me think about my experience in this country and I want to hear what others think.

When I first read this, my initial reaction was a ‚Äúhuh‚Äù which, after some further thought turned into a kind of acceptance and light agreement. But it stayed in my mind all day until I finally decided to put all my thoughts in writing here, 10 hours later.

First, I do feel as if calling the police will end in a positive or at least neutral outcome for me most times. However I feel it is reductive to then claim I have ‚Äúwhite male privilege‚Äù. I sure didn't feel like I had that privilege when I was told by a passing car hanging a Trump flag that ""the US will never be China"" or when my sister was called slurs on the way back to her dorm one night. Remembering these and other occasions honestly did make the white male privilege line start to rub me the wrong way. It almost felt like it was dismissive of my experiences and overly simplifying the reality minorities face by saying ""hey if you can call 911 you're basically white"". Of course, I may be taking it too personally. This wasn't written for me specifically after all, but it is just frustrating how an orientation that tries so hard to be inclusive can say something so tone deaf. Yes, I won't hesitate to call the police if needed. No, I don't feel like I have white male privilege because people still call my friends slurs. Too bad.

Look, in the end I just wanted to say something. I dunno maybe later I'll go send whoever's in charge of this an email or one of you guys can. But I do want to hear what you all think, because I surely can't be the only one who has opinions. Again, I'm not angry so try not be angry in the comments.

1cn9fy0,ucla,Some of USAC‚Äôs demands are ridiculous,"While I agree with some of their demands to Gene Block/admin, bundling that with stuff that will never happen is just shooting your org in the foot. Here is a quote from Daily Bruin about their demands:

‚ÄúThe resolution outlines the five demands of the encampment and calls on Block to meet all of them. The demands include divestment from companies and institutions the encampment says are complicit in Israel‚Äôs occupation of and genocide in Palestine; the disclosure of university financial assets; abolishing policing on campus and severing ties with LAPD; the university calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip; and a boycott of Israeli universities. 

The resolution also calls for the abolishment of the UCLA Younes and Soraya Nazarian Center for Israel Studies.‚Äù

Assuming the Daily Bruin is reporting accurately, which I hope they are, a couple of these demands don‚Äôt make sense to me. 

My biggest issue is that last request. Demanding that an educational institution shut down a part of their education? Like, WHAT? The only way this could be justified at all was if the Israel Studies Center was actively spreading misinformation to its students which I highly doubt. I can‚Äôt even wrap my head around how bizarre this demand is. 

Also for the policing point, I understand the frustrations with campus policing, but wasn‚Äôt the biggest issue that they stood around during the attacks? How is the solution to not have them there at all? Instead I think it would be more reasonable to call for transparency and results in the investigation being run to identify the perpetrators and demand action the improve crisis response policies and student safety procedures for these kinds of events. 

Does anyone have more insight into why USAC passed this? Do they actually think it has even the slightest chance of being accepted by the University?

1f7no99,ucla,Seeking info on rapist Blake Lobato of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.,"In 2018, a Jane Doe filed a series of lawsuits against Zeta Beta Tau as well as Sigma Alpha Epsilon regarding a verified sexual assault that took place at the ZBT house at the hands of fraternity member Blake Lobato.  Once the matter became public, the [Daily Bruin ](https://dailybruin.com/2018/08/20/student-files-lawsuit-against-ucla-fraternities-alleging-sexual-assault)actually uncovered that an underage female (separate from the aforementioned victim) had been raped by Mr. Lobato less than a year earlier.

*""The documents showed that an investigation conducted by the UCLA Title IX office prior to the court filings concluded Lobato had statutorily raped another female student in the fall of 2015.""*

Once the school got involved in the second rape, the case got even more intense:

*According to the court documents, after Lobato was expelled from the fraternity, he threatened to kill the student.  After the threats were made on the student‚Äôs life, the UCLA Title IX office investigated both complaints against Lobato and found him guilty of violating the student conduct code. Lobato was expelled from UCLA in November 2017.*

I am seeking any info on what became of these suits or if Mr. Lobato was ever charged with these assaults or if he settled the matter(s) out of court.  Naturally, he has no online presence and no further information could be gathered online.

1cd341y,ucla,Why UCLA won't divest from Israel (Alum perspective),"It would be political, academic, and reputational suicide for the school.

Divesting would mean burning bridges with the defense primes and biotech/healthcare companies that fund HSSEAS, Life Sci, and PhySci (and provide jobs to a significant portion of the school's STEM grads). It would also damage relationships with the high-net-worth donors who fund the endowment allocation to north campus. UCLA's reputation would collapse, its funding dry up, faculty leave (for lack of funding and reputation hit), etc. North campus is typically more academic-focused than engineering, so divesting may not significantly impact humanities-focused students' ability to get into grad school, but it sure would harm industry-focused students' ability to get jobs (and even potentially get into top med/law schools). 

Also, shoutout to the protestors for being way more civilized and generally well-educated on the nuances of the conflict than at other schools.

1cyx07p,ucla,Regarding UCLA Medical School's admissions controversy and internal faculty drama,"So basically within Geffen med school there's been a lot of concerns that applicants with significantly lower grades and test scores are considered for‚Äîand granted‚Äîadmission. And that they're failing basic tests of competence and failing shelf exams. There's a relatively new dean of admissions named Jennifer Lucero who is reportedly prioritizing racial diversity over traditional metrics, which is causing a lot of tension within the admissions committee. So there's this internal debate happening about the balance between maintaining academic standards and promoting diversity.

Some professors are now claiming that this emphasis on diversity has led to less qualified student cohorts who are struggling academically. And UCLA has fallen in national rankings from #6 to #18 and is seeing a significant rise in the number of students failing standardized tests. The impact on the school's reputation and student performance is becoming more apparent, because falling 12 places in national rankings in 3 years is very rare.

I'm not a a med student currently but I'm a senior premed and I do have a friend who's part of one of the PRIME-LA cohorts, and she's told me about some of the grumblings she's heard about behind the scenes. Basically, Jennifer Lucero's management style and focus on diversity is causing significant internal drama. Some faculty and admissions officers have resigned from the admission committee in protest, alleging racially charged accusations (like insinuating someone is racist if they don't agree to admitting more minority students) and a refusal to address concerns about declining academic standards. And so the medical school has shrunk its preclinical curriculum and introduced courses focusing on social issues, which some professors believe are detracting from essential medical education, while others believe it's important.

There's a [conservative online newsrag ](https://freebeacon.com/campus/a-failed-medical-school-how-racial-preferences-supposedly-outlawed-in-california-have-persisted-at-ucla/)that blew the lid on the situation yesterday, and it's gotten a lot of [traction on twitter.](https://imgur.com/a/d3POcD1) Those people obviously have their own agenda and narrative to spin. But I think some of the internal conflict shows that not everyone is happy with how things are running at Geffen, especially seeing how much the school has fallen in rankings in just 3 years. I'm in the middle. I think they should make a concerted efforts to recruit students from disadvantaged backgrounds, but if that comes at the cost of lowering grade and test scores then maybe it's not the right approach. Investing in student preparation‚Äîbefore they apply to med school‚Äîwould probably be a more fair approach.

I'm more curious to hear opinions from fellow Bruins on here and from people who might work or study at Geffen. What are your thoughts?",-0.53,Politics

1cgc7nr,ucla,One of the pro-Palestine protesters assaulted me on Saturday.,"I was going home on Saturday after a night out drinking and had to cut through campus. The fastest route was through Royce Quad, and up to this point the protesters had seemed peaceful so I saw no problem taking that route. But when I started walking around, completely minding my own business, I heard some shouting and then this redhead with a European accent grabbed me from behind and threw me backwards. I almost fell down the stairs. I thought about saying/doing something, but there were about 20 other protesters right there and I was frankly scared that things would escalate even more and I would get seriously hurt.

  
If you asked me a week ago what I thought of the conflict, I would have said I don't feel strongly one way or the other. That I completely sympathized with the people of Palestine who were thrown out of their land and thought they should be able to continue to live safely in their ancestral homes, but that they also responded horribly by electing Hamas and killing innocent people on October 7th. Now, what I thought a week ago doesn't matter to me. Right or wrong, what I most strongly associate with Palestine is being assaulted on my own campus when I did nothing wrong by someone who probably doesn't even go here. I'm not necessarily pro-Israel, but after what happened, I'm definitely anti-Palestine. And frankly, I don't think that's ever gonna change, because no rational argument can make me sympathize with a group after their supporters attacked me unprovoked.

  
I'm not really sure what the point of this post is. I guess I'm just saying to watch out, because these protesters are getting violent and they're not as peaceful as the other posts and comments in this sub claim (even if 90% are peaceful, letting 10% attack passers-by is complicity). And by the same token, if you're a part of the protest, call out your fellow protesters if they get physical. Not only because it's the right thing to do, but because you're probably making way more enemies than friends. There's no way I'm the only student with an experience like this.",-0.83,Politics

1fd35qa,ucla,I‚Äôm so tired of the fetishization of Comp Sci majors.,"The females on this campus are out of control. The first time I ate lunch wearing my ‚ÄúMay the F=MA be with you!‚Äù CSE shirt I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

Anyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past couple days since welcome week and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, at every restaurant. But yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last weekly COMM 10 ""project"". Girl, I don't struggle with projects that are just homework. I'm a Computer science major, not an English major. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT, in fact, want to copulate in Kerckhoff Hall, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am enrolled in the hardest program on campus (which was not difficult for me to get into, by the way).

The worst are when students from non-technical majors talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: ""What's your major?"" As soon as I say that magnificent phrase, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. What makes a business major think they have a chance with me. Comp Sci and some puny CLS majors are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that does Public Speaking (ugh) for ""work.""

You may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in Civil Engineering (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in Phantom Forces (that‚Äôs Roblox, for you uncultured chumps). My computer science shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, smurf noobs, know all the best strats, and most of all, watch Star Wars with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout ""Luke - I am your father!"" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic moment in Star Wars: Episode V ‚Äì The Empire Strikes Back. Not that I cried.

If you want somebody for cheap sex, the Business majors are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding non-war profiting business types though). Stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was a business major, moving through the world in ignorant bliss.

1gvhcov,ucla,Gratitude post: EPICURIA worker,"Went to Epic today to pick up some pasta. Apparently my order was spilled somehow and I was a little frustrated considering I had class in 15 minutes. Obviously I never want to cause a scene, but there was a tinge of anger building up with each passing minute I stood next to the line, seeing everyone else get their food normally. Eventually, I was called over by a different cashier and was relieved that my order was finally ready, however, they were only there to apologize-- it was the one who dropped it and he just wanted to be honest about what happened and let me know the order was coming in 5 minutes. My class started in 5, and it had attendance, so I couldn't miss it. The other cashier wouldn't let me redo the order for an hour later, but the man who dropped it insisted that he will pay for another one to be ready after my class at 1. I was honestly astonished that a worker, who would face no repercussions for just walking away and continuing his job, was willing to spend an hour of his pay to buy me a meal later, let alone stand face to face with someone who could've had their day ruined by such a random, unfortunate mistake.

On my way to class, I walked through campus and thought about how everyone is built for their own survival, essentially, that selfishness is more advantageous than selflessness, but my mind had just been twisted. The worker's gratitude gave me happiness, and it was a rare scene of compassion that I found in LA. I was buzzing the whole day after I picked up my meal after class. I wanted to insist on paying it for myself, but the loop of ""insisting"" would have just kept going. At the end of all this, it was me who felt guilty. I decided to swipe in two of my off campus friends for dinner that night, but even then still felt guilty. I had gone so long being selfish that I had forgot how advantageous it was to the soul to share. 

This post is embarrassing as hell, and I probably look like an asshole, but idc as long as I am being honest. Check yourself and make sure there is no hypocrisy within your own soul, make sure you understand who each action you make benefits, and be sure to share that benefit with others.

The time for a ceasefire was a long time ago, I‚Äôm extremely opposed to Bibi and his government, and I‚Äôm fiercely against the settlements in the West Bank. So Please don't act like I'm some right-wing zionist extremist because I'm not.

Exactly one year ago on October 7, 2023, the largest killing of Jews since the Holocaust occured. About 1200 people were killed by Hamas and about 250 were kidnapped. People were raped, people were burned alive... you get the idea. It was not an act of resistance, it was an indiscriminate act of terrorism.

My question is, out of literally any other day of the year, why are people choosing today to go out and protest? I understand that most of the protesters do not condone the actions of Hamas. However, SJP has demonstrated that they're willing to give defense for Hamas. The national SJP had explicitly called Hamas a ""progressive organization"" on its website. UCLA SJP had posted a direct quote from a Hamas higher-up and has also called for the full destruction of Israel. UCLA SJP posted about today's protest on their Instagram, so I'd assume they had at least some involvement.

Even if we assume that none of the protesters condone the actions of Hamas, does optics simply not exist? Between today's date and the SJP involvement, I fail to see how this won't appear as a celebration of Hamas to many people.

1ch2yoy,ucla,The beliefs of the protestors on campus - taken straight from the SJP's most recent newsletter,"Just wanted to share the beliefs and missions of the National  Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) movement, who organized the  ongoing protests on our campus.   

The statements that I am quoting come from the third ‚ÄúWritten Resistance‚Äù posted by the SJP on their website [https://nationalsjp.org/](https://nationalsjp.org/)  in April of this year. The ‚ÄúWritten Resistance‚Äù is a communist-leaning  newsletter that includes opinion pieces from various members of SJP,  along with its editorial board. The SJP has released to previous  newsletter earlier this school year, however their language was much  less explicit in their missions and beliefs in comparison to the most  recent one, which references Mao Tse-Tung, a Chinese dictator who was  responsible for the deaths of 20-45 million people during his time in  power \[1\], as well as Lenin, the founder of the USSR and proponent for  war communism, who was responsible for over 5 million deaths under his  leadership \[2\]. Neither of these leaders‚Äô backgrounds are acknowledged  and the authors express agreement with them on the United States,  imperialism, and capitalism/communism. More importantly, there are  several references to Lenin‚Äôs theories on communist revolution, in which  a vanguard party violently overthrows the ruling class in order to take  power, which was implemented in many devastating communist revolutions  and regimes, including Mao‚Äôs, Lenin‚Äôs, and Kim‚Äôs \[3\].  Now, onto some of  the quotes that have caught my attention, along with some background  information where needed.   

* ‚ÄúFor all its imperfections, Hamas is a progressive organization  pursuing a program of national emancipation and democratic  reconstruction‚Äù (Rosa Mezerich, 13)   
   * Clear support for Hamas. If they tell you that just because they are  anti-Israel it doesn't mean they are pro-Hamas, they're lying or  haven't done an ounce of research into the movement they are supporting.   
* ‚ÄúWe do not seek the victory of our nation‚Äôs ruling class over the  other but rather the destruction of our own nation‚Äôs ruling class  through military defeat‚Äù (Elijah Brawner, 9)   
* ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòwar‚Äô is, in fact, an escalation of the ongoing Nakba. The land  between the river and sea is not ‚ÄòIsraeli territory;‚Äô it is occupied  Palestine. Our chants and phrases must also show our militant solidarity  with those confronting imperialism directly: rather than: ‚ÄòFrom the  belly of the beast, Hands off the Middle East,‚Äô we must shout: ‚ÄòYemen,  Yemen, make us proud! Turn another ship around!‚Äù (Elijah Brawner, 10)   
   * this refers to the Houthi terrorist group in the Yemen that incited  the ongoing civil war that has killed more than 160,000 people. I have  linked the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement) that contains their colorful slogan involving the U.S., Israel, and Jewish people.   
* ‚ÄúNo action is too radical-this sentiment was carried to its limits  just two months before the publication of this newsletter. Aaron  Bushnell‚Äôs self-immolation shocked the world‚Äù (Sean Eren, 12)   
   * Glorifies what this man did and encourages their followers to do similar acts: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68405119](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68405119) 
* ‚ÄúWe see heroic acts of international solidarity by Yemeni comrades  stopping commerce in the Red Sea, incredible feats of resistance by  Palestinian fighters, and essential politico-military unity between the  Palestinian factions‚Äù (Rosa Mezerich, 12)   
   * again referring to Houthi who were/are [attacking ships in the Red Sea](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67614911) 
* ‚ÄúThe Palestinian Communists understand the only path forward  requires the destruction of the settler state and the disenfranchisement  of its compradors in a national democratic revolution, empowering all  working and patriotic forces to continue into socialist transformation‚Äù  (Rosa Mezerich, 13)   
   *  And they claim to be anti-war and pacifists.

3) Police violence 

When you see tents and lamps and batteries and supplies littered all over the ground, know that people spent money and resources on those things. We want our stuff back.

Punish the protesters by making them clean up their mess? The punishment was NOT letting them get back their stuff. You guys weren‚Äôt there. You didn‚Äôt see how many of us packed supplies that were outside the encampment to try to use them for another day.

1ftrlvr,ucla,Subway Manager Pissed cuz of coupons,"I pissed off the manager to the fullest extent yesterday. So I went with a friend who had stacks of subway coupons, we decided to use all of them up before they expire October 10th. Note we have only gone for 3 days and yesterday was the worse.

Thursday- He had a buy one sub and get one free, so we decided to stack it with a 7.99 foot long coupon. We go and we both order our 2 subs and surprise the total comes out to 28.67!!!! We ask her why so high and she replies ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the price‚Äù and proceeds to reach for our bruin cards. I stop her and hand her the two coupons and he then says. ‚ÄúCoupon not working, line to long. Pay now.‚Äù My friend was about to cave until I told her no thank u, we want to use the 2 coupons or we wont pay. She proceeds to give me an annoying glare and mumble some stuff under her breath and the screen goes to black and she types on the screen for like 10 seconds and magically both coupons went through and we got both sandwiches for one swipe and like 2.23$. When she handed me my card she kinda rudely tossed it on the table and shoed us away but whatever.

Friday- We decided to get the exact same subs and use the last 2 7.99 coupons he had. We get to the cash register and magically the total was 32.56 this time. We pull out the coupons and she says this time ‚ÄúSorry, only one coupon per sale.‚Äù My friend replys, ‚ÄúIts ok, we can just do separate.‚Äù And hands me one of the coupons. Manager rebuttals ‚ÄúLine to long, easier like this.‚Äù We just shake our heads and again the screen goes black and she types some stuff into the computer and we both walk away with our foot longs for only one swipe each. Thankfully no mumbling or rudeness this time, just subtle annoyance ig.

Monday (Yesterday): We get in line after our ochem class all excited for our little discounted subway, like I mean it. We felt so good eating overpriced food after all the times she over charged us over the year prior. We start building our subs, we only where planning on using 2 6 inch for 5 dollar coupons and a free drink coupons this time. (Lokey gonna run out of coupons by Thursday) Anyways, after we get our subs toasted she tells us ‚ÄúNo coupons, machine is broken. Only card and swipe. Or no Sandwich please.‚Äù Lokey this time is was kinda awkward up the place was semi packed so we just said thats fine or something. I payed full price for my sub, and drink. My friend was about to too until homie just swiped the coupon and it went through!!! Obviously i was now mad because I was overcharged and she lied to me so I demanded a refund for the 1.86 charged on my card. She looked blanked and said I didn‚Äôt know and that I couldn‚Äôt get a refund because I didn‚Äôt have a receipt. I then asked for a re-print of my receipt and to at least refund the money on my card. Lets just say we did kinda stand there for a while than we wanted to, argued, and i got my refund, but this time she said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come back.‚Äù

Should we stop, I genuinely feel like if I go back again she might get more mean or just straight up ban us over coupons. Like I want to use the get 3 foot longs for 21.99 today but I genuinely feel like it‚Äôs just going to lead to an argument. Also should I record the encounter, idk if it‚Äôs like illegal to record the workers on school grounds. But it‚Äôs no longer fun anymore, just uncomfortable.",-0.83,Finance

1hg5s7e,ucla,HOT TAKE: Some UCLA students are the biggest complainers,"I just saw a post about the ‚Äútruths about UCLA‚Äù and while there are some valid points made, a lot of them aren‚Äôt even UCLA-specific but more so grievances of going to a ‚Äúbig public school‚Äò. Many sound like absolute ingrates saying ‚ÄúUCLA has done nothing for me‚Äù‚Äîyou‚Äôre free to transfer out if you hate it here.

Truth is, there are some ppl here with a chip on their shoulder maybe cuz they got rejected from an Ivy or b/c it‚Äòs the most prestigious and cost-effective school they could get into, or b/c they aren‚Äôt personally successful so they blame it soley on the school. They then start comparing UCLA to those elite private schools expecting UCLA to match those resources relative to its ‚Äúprestige.‚Äú Mind you UCLA is a PUBLIC school which is inherently different in mission, nature, and size! The Ivy League and other elite private schools are EXCLUSIONARY by nature. They‚Äôre completely different so it‚Äôs unfair to compare both when one serves to educate the general public and the other educates the elite. For example,

Harvard has \~ 7,000 undergrads compared to UCLA w/ \~33,000.

And Harvard cost 3x the amount. It might be worth the money b/c it‚Äôs Harvard and schools alike, but when comparing to other elite privates with similar prestige, UCLA is an amazing deal with ample opportunities and arguably higher ROI.

My question is: are you actively seeking those resources, opportunities, and connections? Yes, UCLA has a lot to improve (better promoting resources &amp; engagement), but the grass is not always greener and there are still plenty of opportunities here. In my experience, the Bruin alumni I connected with on LinkedIn and UCLA ONE have given me tremendous mentorship and referrals which helped me land a job.

It is give and take‚Äîyou have to actively seek and contribute to get something out of it. You can‚Äôt expect Alumni to reach out to you if you don‚Äôt take the step first to reach out. You can also start by helping fellow Bruins out whether if it‚Äôs passing on knowledge, internships, scholarships, and advice. UCLA imo already punches above its weight‚Äîbeing one of the only two public schools (other Berkeley) to ever rank T20 nationally alongside privates in the U.S. News report‚Äîso that is somewhat a reflection of the school‚Äôs strength no matter how flawed rankings might be.

The person is posting to a website for photos of ""candid girls"" under the username gloryyhole, tagging some posts as gloryyoc. 

The person regularly targets the undie run (they have photos and videos up from multiple undie runs over the last couple years), and has many posts up with inappropriate and sexual descriptions of what they want to do to the students. Some of the posts seem to have been reposted on different pornographic sites. There also seem to be posts from the general LA area as well off-campus.

Even worse, the person seems to have a private Telegram channel where they charge people money for some of the pictures and videos they have taken. 

I came across this because I saw a news article on a similar situation that happened at the University of North Texas recently. When I googled the site I recognized photos of the UCLA campus on there.

https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/university-of-north-texas-investigating-creeper-photographer-20550713

I don't want to link the person's profile to bring more attention to it, but in case anyone wants to check if there are photos of themselves on there, you can Google ""candid girls io gloryyhole"" and the profile should come up. 

I wish the school or police could do something about this, but I'm not sure what could be done. Based on what I've read, it seems forums like this emphasize only posting pictures of adult women who are in public (since that seems to be technically legal). They don't want people posting illegal content like filming someone in a shower or posting a minor, because the creeps that run these sites don't want them to get shut down.

Maybe even if it's not illegal, someone could still contact the media to blow this up and get the school to take action?

At the very least, I wanted to make people aware there is a predator filming female students at UCLA and posting it online. Please spread the word to your friends who don't use Reddit so that they know.

1e23j6c,ucla,My program got cancelled,"I am 23 years old, working part time. It‚Äôs been two years since I graduated from UCB. I decided last fall that I wanted to go back to school for a masters in environmental engineering. I applied to UCR for the Spring 2024 quarter, and a little later, I applied to UCLA for Fall 2024.

I got admitted to UCR and started familiarizing myself with the staff. They were pretty easy to reach &amp; I was happy. Then UCLA accepted my application. I withdrew from UCR because I had heard good things about Civil/Env eng at UCLA from older coworkers. Unfortunately, I can only assume that the subject has become neglected in the time since those coworkers attended the school.

I went to visit UCLA for grad admitted students day. I spent money on parking, met students in engineering, and took a day off of work. Aka, I was applying myself. I decided that the sooner I started learning, the sooner I could finish. That led me to apply for a summer class at ucla. I spent two weeks reviewing chem for this class, and I dumped a load of money on tuition (planned to pay this 1 class up front, def can't afford to do that for all 9 in the program). 

So the class starts and everything seems alright, except there are only 3 other students. But this is a master‚Äôs class, so what do I know about that. The next day, I get an email saying that the admissions period for Fall 2024 closed and I was the only admit for my specialty. Therefore, UCLA has decided to terminate the program, sorry for the inconvenience, and I can switch to another specialty.

The options they gave me were truly terrible. I can switch to a specialty that has 0 to do with my career goals, yay me. Also, they offered to refund my application fee. But if they looked at my application, they would see that I waived it in the first place. So I am pretty annoyed that they didn‚Äôt bother learning a thing about me before sending an official notice letter to literally just me.

More on that, they had no idea that I was enrolled in a class, like, right now. Meaning that they didn‚Äôt drop it and refund it for me, which would have been a nice courtesy at least. No, instead I had to ask for a refund, and they had the balls to keep $50. I‚Äôm trying to get that back, but we‚Äôll see.

Now, my only reasonable option is to apply to another school. The application window for Fall 2024 at every school is already closed, as that lovely letter was kind enough to point out, so I have to wait until Spring 2025 to start a masters program in my field of choice. I am super annoyed with UCLA for eating up a year of my time. Clearly, the env eng specialty has been dying off for a long time, and they never bothered to warn me. I could have stayed at UCR.

1cdppxs,ucla,Can Protestors stop talking about the Intifada or chanting river to the sea? counter protestors are eating that shit up and using it as ammo,"i spent a lot of yesterday in the encampment, it was cool and it‚Äôs so awesome to see our community come together to protest the deaths of 30,000 Palestinians, 70% being women and children. what‚Äôs more cool is with all the shitty stuff counter protestors are doing, people are so resilient to all the hate and able to resist the temptation to be hateful back on our side

but i spent about two hours with my friend walking the perimeter talking to counter protestors, i wanted to see why they thought these protests were so bad. many of the yellow vest protestors said don‚Äôt engage with the counter protestors, but idk i was very interested in understanding how people could be so hateful and against a very good cause?

every counter protester who i approached respectfully was respectful to me. maybe it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm a white guy, but everytime i approached a counter protestor they had a civilized discussion with me, it was only in mobs where people were shitty

they all said the same thing: they felt threatened and i was so confused how they could feel that way, no one on our side was being mean at all!

they explained to me SPECIFICALLY TWO THINGS: how the intifada (idk if this is true but this is what 8 SEPERATE counter protestors told me) is analgous to Palestine overthrowing Israel and murdering a bunch of jews, and how chanting river to the sea would mean the destruction of israel, and that a driving factor of why they were so heated at the protest was because they thought those kind of comments threatened the jewish community

i don‚Äôt know if this is true! If someone more informed then me in the comments wants to correct me that‚Äôs fine!

But it feels like counter protestors are justifying their shitty actions by using words im not sure if many people in the encampment know the meaning of? or atleast i didn‚Äôt idk, unless someone in the comments correct me im not going to chant about to the river to the sea or the intifada anymore, all it does it gives counter protestors ammo to be shitty (maybe they would‚Äôve been shitty anyway and i‚Äôm being naive)

It feels like protestors are doing so much work to allow the protests to be peaceful and good meaning. and they are! but if what the counter protestors is saying is true, should we be focused more on ending the war and chanting about freeing Palestine then chanting slogans that equate to the death of Jews? idk, don‚Äôt get me wrong a lot of counter protesters were saying very dumb shit but i do think they have a point here?",-0.23,Politics

1ck66g9,ucla,Disc: How do you expect Jews to act on campus?,"The reality of the situation is that at least 80% (if not far more) of Jewish bruins support the existence of the state of Israel. Why? Well because UCLA historically has a very high concentration of Middle Eastern Jews who were ethnically cleansed from their countries. Most of them are the children of refugees. And a majority of these students also have family in Israel. For the most part, middle eastern Jews had the option to move to Israel or America. I‚Äôm not saying this to gather sympathy, I‚Äôm just stating the facts. 

For these students, Zionism just means ‚ÄúThe right for there to be a Jewish state‚Äù. It does not mean they agree with the actions of the current government. However, I can see how the constant focus on Israel while ignoring the actions of countries like China (who have thrown ~450k Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps) can come off as antisemitic. It feels like the only country being persecuted is the one filled with Jewish refugees. Additionally, instances of antisemitism has increased on campus (I.e swastikas on Jewish buildings, a Nazi truck playing Jewish blood libel on a loud speaker outside of Anderson this week, people chanting for a global intifada). 

Anyways, how do you expect Jewish students to act on campus to be accepted by the larger Bruin community? Are they supposed to stop calling themselves Zionists?  Are they supposed to not want the existence of a Jewish state? 

And I‚Äôm genuinely asking here. So please be civil in the comments. This isn‚Äôt a place to spew more hatred or to talk about the non student counter protestors. 

Update: Reading through the comments, I get the sentiment that people truly think Zionists advocate for the genocide of Palestinians. I want to assure you that that‚Äôs NOT TRUE. A very large majority of Zionists believe in a 2-state solution and hope for peace one day. Being pro-Israel or a Zionist also doesn‚Äôt mean you agree with the actions of the current government. And I noticed that some people did not know that Palestinians were offered a 2-state solution 6 times. 

At the end of the day, it looks like most students want the same thing, peace for both Palestinians and Jews. And I do believe it‚Äôs possible to be both Pro-Palestinian and Pro-Israel. Those two things are not mutually exclusive. I implore folks to have more conversations with their peers. Being Pro-Israel is not being Pro-genocide and being Pro-Palestine is not being Pro-Hamas. Don‚Äôt let radical ideologies highjack  the issue. We‚Äôre bruins which means we‚Äôre smarter than that and are beautiful critical thinkers who know better than to look at every issue as black or white.

1cm7lhm,ucla,Your encampment protests are catching on internationally,"Here in Ireland, there has been an encampment on the campus of Trinity College for the past week. The protesters have blocked off the Book of Kells - a book of Celtic art which a lot of tourists have at the top of their list to see when they come to Dublin. Blocking it off has denied the college thousands of euros in fees that people pay to view it (‚Ç¨20 entry pp, I think).

I know some of the protesters and you students have inspired them to take this action. If I was a student there, i‚Äôd be taking part - I work a 9-5 now in my 30‚Äôs, so I attend marches when I can, fly the Palestinian flag from my balcony, donate money to Gaza, and tell everyone who will listen about the horrors in Gaza perpetrated by Israel and the US government. Lately, i‚Äôve been talking a lot about the violence you protesters are exposed to in the states.

I know people are having a hard time adjusting and it must take a mental toll, having your studies interrupted and bracing for punishment or even assault from bad people. You protestors are brave. If you look back at protest movements in history that brought real change that you admire, consider what could be achieved here if you support your fellow students in this struggle.

Your treatment at the hands of your government is terrifying. Regardless of what side you are on politically, you should surely be concerned about how the government has cracked down on peaceful protests in your country? What happens if you want to fight for another cause or your freedoms in the future if they employ these tactics to crush you? Rubber bullets, allowing mobs to beat you, police assaulting your elderly professors, aren‚Äôt you alarmed, even as a zionist? If you are pro-America, surely you would defend the right to peaceful protest? The same is happening in Germany and France at the moment. 

To sum up, there is a lot of support over here in Ireland for you guys. We know what it is to struggle against authoritarianism. We have been subject to controlled famine, ethnic cleansing in regions across our country, and our language and culture has been reduced to a shade of what it once was. We see through the mist. 

Continue the fight, make it the fight of your life, make the tyrants feel it.

1cez90j,ucla,Got followed from century city BEWARE!!,"Tonight, me and my two roommates were coming back from century city and we had just gotten out of the first bus on Westwood &amp; Santa Monica. One of us had a big bag from the mall and we all had our purses with us. As we were waiting to cross the street to get to the connecting bus stop an INDIAN man around five foot tall with a GREY COLUMBIA JACKET, a dark blue shirt, and GLASSES approached us from behind. (We think he followed us off the bus.)I was standing about one to two feet away from my two roommates so I saw him approaching in between them from behind. He then started to ask ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù to which one of my roommates said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, please stop talking to us‚Äù We thought that was it but he continued talking and started trying to shake our hands with one hand while INTENSELY FIDDLING with something in his pocket with his other hand. We were scared that he may have a knife or something. At some point even after we told him repeatedly to stop talking to us, he started asking my two friends ‚ÄúAre you Indian?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you Indian Girls?‚Äù. One of my roommates is white, the other is hispanic, and I am East Asian so we clearly are not Indian. During this, I started getting my pepper spray in my pocket ready and one of my roommates literally took out her pepper spray and made sure he saw it. That‚Äôs when the light finally turned green and we crossed the street behind us. We were scared of standing at the second bus stop since the bus wouldn‚Äôt be there for another five minutes so we walked into the gas station. 


We were honestly still scared after going into the store because there was only one customer that walked out pretty much as soon as we went in. The guy actually entered the store and proceeded to talk to the cashier and then started standing next to the door so he clearly wasn‚Äôt there to buy anything. After a while he got a phone call and we went out of the store cause our bus was about to arrive. As we walked to the bus stop we could clearly see him watching us from the gas station window but thank goodness he didn‚Äôt continue following us cause if he had we were about to call 911. We got really lucky this time but please be careful and share any other safety tips you may have!!!

1h7w37z,ucla,Sharing my story: A message to the deans office,"Hi,

My name is Austin. This is something I never wanted to post but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve had enough with, and I‚Äôve heard stories of this exact situation happen to other students but I‚Äôm going to tell my story. If I get in trouble for this then I don‚Äôt care but I‚Äôm going to speak up cause what‚Äôs going on at the dean‚Äôs office is incredibly messed up.

Back in December of 2023, I was accused of using Al and plagiarism for my final paper. It was something I was completely in shock to hear that because I have never used Al or would plagiarize on a paper, and I am fully against it. I even submitted as much evidence as possible. I could include Ai checkers and my own doc. Unfortunately they did not believe me, and told to move on to a hearing which was back in January of this year. However I did not hear back from them until August of this year. Over half a year after the accusation. My initial thought was maybe due to lack of evidence on there end they decided to drop the whole hearing. However that was not the case. Finally I was able to get in touch with a lawyer, and was able to push back the hearing to an unspecified date however I'm hoping that it might not move forward. I still however need to pay the lawyer more money to continue being represented which I currently don‚Äôt have the money yet but at least they pushed back the hearing. I'm currently atm repeating the class but have been struggling recently due to personal family matters, school itself, finding a new job. This whole situation has added nothing but a lot of distress. Including everything going on in my personal life.

Today it has happened again this time with another teacher for the same class I'm currently retaking. This professor said that he had concerns about my paper, and that it was ‚Äúun original‚Äù. Once again I submitted proof showing that there is no Al or plagiarism in my paper. I used Turnitin‚Äôs AI and plagiarism checker as well as GPTZero. He wants to have a meeting with me to discuss my paper even though I shared clear concrete evidence that there is nothing wrong with my paper. I also have edits on my paper to prove I wrote it.

I'm sharing this story because earlier I‚Äôve mentioned that l've seen other people who have dealing with a similar situation like mine. Being accused of something you never done. Being guilty until proven innocent instead of innocent until proven guilty. I have read and heard about the exact same stories that once your accused your basically given a guilty verdict regardless of evidence showing that you‚Äôre innocent. Even though they claim that‚Äôs not the case. I want to make a change for the better, and to speak up because what is going on is beyond messed up. I heard last year they opted out of using AI checkers which I think is beyond stupid for them to opt of, and I believe they should implement them, and make it a mandatory use so they can have concrete proof that someone used AI instead of accusing someone when they have no proof or evidence to back up there claims. I understand proving Ai and plagiarism but mainly Ai is tricky, and I get it. Living in this age of Ai is scary, and unknown. But with that said SMC had a plagiarism checker when I attended idk why UCLA doesn‚Äôt. They have a license to use Turnitin. Some teachers do use Turnitin but not all when it should be mandatory.

I‚Äôm also apart of CAE. I have diagnosed Anxiety, and Autism. I can go to lectures just fine, and talk to my peers. But because of my anxiety sometimes it‚Äôs hard for me to go to a discussion class, or just a class where I have to participate knowing I‚Äôm going to stay mute which I‚Äôve mentioned to other professors. Because of this I don‚Äôt go to them all the time. I don‚Äôt mind going if I‚Äôm not forced to talk. I don‚Äôt have a problem emailing professors or other TA‚Äôs or even talking to them in a private setting. With that said I don‚Äôt believe the deans office or any of my professors are taking me seriously. Especially since they still want to move forward with a hearing. My case manager also wanted me to resolve this whole situation by myself, and to prioritize talking to the current professor which I did, and explained that it‚Äôs my original paper. I mentioned to them that this has happened before. Believe me I have receipts of all of the encounters.

I‚Äôm hoping by sharing my story, and my time at UCLA people will share this story. I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I would be more than interested in performing a rally to show that enough is enough. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm hugely interested in. I don‚Äôt want there to any more wrongful accusations for students, and are dealing with the same situation I‚Äôm dealing with right now. I‚Äôm 100% against academic dishonesty, my mom‚Äôs a teacher for crying out loud. If she found out I used Ai or plagiarism on a paper I‚Äôd be disowned. But when you‚Äôre accused of something with no evidence to prove it, that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs not fair or morally right.

1gkv14p,ucla,confused,"over the last 8 years we haven‚Äôt really talked about why so many people are voting MAGA, even before this election they were getting 50% of the population, and before we kind of just brushed that under the rug. In 2016 we just focused on the popular vote and in 2020 we kind of just moved on after Biden won. No matter what the issues with Kamala were or her campaign America. There were no issues with independent votes or green party. 

Coming into these elections as a teen I had been taught and kind of just assumed that these people were brainwashed trumpies which is what the Left wanted to tell us. But we have to accept now that this is the majority of americans. 

I don‚Äôt believe that 50% of Americans are racist, sexist, homophobic, etc‚Ä¶ Maybe thats true but it just doesn‚Äôt seem possible. These are regular everyday people that are falling into the rhetoric. 

Something trump has always had going for him is how steadfast people believe in him. Sometimes no matter what he says, to them he comes across as strong and decisive. For some reason people think that none of the bad stuff he says he will actually do. or if he does it won‚Äôt apply to them. People voting for Trump will claim to be one issue voters on the border, the economy, transgender stuff, etc‚Ä¶ but when fact checked every time they continue to defend him. 

I don‚Äôt get it because if you come over to the democrats you have people looking to criticize our leaders at every step. This election was lost because of undecided/democrat voters going red because of their harsh criticisms of biden harris policies, while not examining trumps to the slightest. 

i don‚Äôt understand how we could elect obama as a unified country back to back, with the premise of really combating racism and equality issues. I don‚Äôt get how those swing voters could go for obama in 2008 and trump now. It‚Äôs like people were hiding their real feelings this whole time and that our country IS  bigoted and hateful. That makes me sick. 

I don‚Äôt understand how the democratic party couldn‚Äôt do a better job of reaching voters. Like so many people didn‚Äôt like trump because of his character but still voted for him anyways because we didn‚Äôt put up a strong front on our policies, campaigning or whatever. There must be a good democrat leader out there who has good policies that will help our people and can clearly demonstrate it to all Americans. We all have the same problems. It shouldn‚Äôt be so hard to show that there is some solutions or some steps in the right directions that would help those problems. That‚Äôs all anybody wants. 

I don‚Äôt understand how the republican party has become what it is. There must be something going on be it with the party or the way campaigning and media is or something. I don‚Äôt believe americans are sexist, racist, bigoted. I don‚Äôt believe americans hate each other. I think we are scared and have our own problems and how can there not be a better person available to address those problems. Regardless of his policies, of his character. Republicans have admitted that they would never elect (another) felon. Why because it‚Äôs trump do people excuse all of these things. I just don‚Äôt get it. 

Im disappointed in what it seems that we are and the reality of that means. Worried about the future, with no idea of what he does will be what he said or worse.

On Saturday I went to the 4th floor of stacks where I was completely alone and decided to sit by the tables against the window. 15 min in I hear someone in between the book shelves and didn‚Äôt mind if I thought it was a student or something. Another 15 min goes by and the noise is much closer. I see someone sitting on a roller chair 2 rows behind me ‚Äúreading a book‚Äù. Another couple min passes and he scoots out of shelfs into the walk way of stacks and is sitting on that same chair with no books nothing. I was completely alone on this floor and terrified . He was 5 feet behind me with his legs wide open and everytime I turned around he was staring me down. I was one of the first people in the library there was no one in the collaborative area of the library other than the workers. So I was very scared that from all places in the library this person had to sit 5 ft behind me and not against a table or studying just sitting in the middle of a walkway . He didn‚Äôt look like a student but was young, was tall skinny with headphones splatter paint jeans but no back pack

TOP: 

Sig Chi - known as the classic ‚Äúnature guy‚Äù house. Cool guys overall, decent parties. House is unique, but in an inconvenient location. Solid sorority relations, but less active social calendar relative to other top houses.

Snu - overall best parties. Tends to have the biggest social budget (tied with SAE), so usually has a packed calendar. Lots of athletes and guys are all pretty cool. Hosts a lot of packed concerts, but can be tough to get in even as a girl because of how crowded they are. 

SAE - stereotypical ‚Äúfrat‚Äù dudes. Overall solid house, but tends to get in trouble a lot. Usually on and off social probation. Has a good amount of fun annual/quarterly events too. 

Upper mid: 

Sig Ep - used to be a lot better, still has a solid reputation and relationship with sororities, but lacking recently. House is an old apartment building so it‚Äôs not much an actual frat house. 

Lambda  - has been on the rise, guys are cool but some of the ones I‚Äôve met seem a little too full of themelves. Overall good(ish) parties and decent sorority relations.

Mid: 

Phi Psi - super sick house, nicest on the row for sure. Cool and unique guys, genuinely nice people. 

ZBT - overall pretty douchey, they just got a new house, not sure how it is. This is another house that used to be good but not as much anymore. 

Taxi - only house with a pool! Fun place to be in the summer. Don‚Äôt know much about them. 

Beta - hosts a bunch of concerts. Not a ton of guys in the frat, but overall solid social presence.

our entire apartment is infested with cockroaches which they tried to pest control but it didn't do shit. i am living in constant fight or flight mode. i don't even want to be in my own place anymore. termites chewed a big ass gap near the window in my bathroom and started falling into my tub. they said they would do this big operation to kill all of them and replace the entire wood frame in the area, but in the end all they did was take some drywall paste thing and fill the gap in. so yeah, i don't see them anymore, but the termites are definitely still there, chewing through the structure of the building. 

  
i know that some positive reviews praise the management of this place, but that is far from my experience having been a tenant for over a year. while the manager is a friendly guy most of the time, he has 1) blamed me for not picking up my package sooner when someone broke in and stole all the packages even though he forgot to lock the mailroom door and 2) repeatedly blame me for making loud noises above him (my unit is above his) late in the night when i am literally asleep and refuses to believe me even though i have sent photos proving i am in bed when he complained. don't even get me started on how my car was broken into in the middle of the night when it was parked safe and sound in the gated garage.",-0.93,Mental Health

1cnn0ub,ucla,"""If you care so much why don't you go to Gaza?!""","""Why are random protestors disturbing classes for a war across the sea?""

""If you really cared you'd be donating to Gaza not an encampment""

We've all probably have heard sentiments along these lines which basically boil down to ""Why on earth do people on our campus care so much for an issue that's not even related to UCLA/me? And why does my education have to be disrupted because of it?""

These are feelings and questions I get people having. While they're annoying to receive, I do think that the Palestinian Liberation Movement and/or SJP at UCLA haven't done a very good job of communicating why students should care.

Let's face it. Students at UCLA, like most people, do not care about something unless it directly affects them. That is a fact every social movement has had to contend with.

Let's start with the beginning:

**THE UCLA - ISRAELI - MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX**

On October 25th, 2023, the Department of Defense started a 27 million dollar initiative connecting seventeen different sites throughout Southern California to develop a microelectronics development hub called "" the California Defense Ready Electronics and Microdevices Superhub"" AKA ""California DREAMS"".

[https://microelectronicscommons.org/connect/california-defense-ready-electronics-and-microdevices-superhub-california-dreams/](https://microelectronicscommons.org/connect/california-defense-ready-electronics-and-microdevices-superhub-california-dreams/)

Goals are to develop microelectronics for the purposes of:

[Emphasis on Electromagnetic Warfare](https://preview.redd.it/d08lxj9j9bzc1.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0287879d4bf20911641b576c9bd9245a2d886d42)

Universities and Corporate Entities make up the different sites. The universities include:

Caltech

Morgan State University

UC Irvine

UCLA

UC Riverside

UC Santa Barbara

UC San Diego

USC

So essentially this initiative includes **every single UC school in Southern California and USC.** I hope the point is being driven home right now that the connection that our school has to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is in fact, very relevant to us and very close to home.

The development of California DREAMS is part of the United States' CHIPS Act which is arming Israel with weapons its using in the conflict (California DREAMS =&gt; CHIPS Act =&gt; Israel). The technology developed at UCLA and ALL the sites are being used to develop weapons via the corporate members of the Hub including: **BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.** Bear in mind this is information we do have - weapons sales and other data points are difficult to find.

[https://progressive.org/latest/bidens-chips-act-is-being-used-to-arm-israel-dilawar-240124/](https://progressive.org/latest/bidens-chips-act-is-being-used-to-arm-israel-dilawar-240124/)

Boeing also donated 5 million dollars to faculty at the Center for Quantum Science and Engineering.

[https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/boeing-5-million-quantum-science-technology](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/boeing-5-million-quantum-science-technology)

As mentioned in this UCLA news report, research and funds will be used to develop ""defense systems"" and boost ""national security"".

Keep in mind that prior to being called the Department of Defense, the department's name was the Department of War. This language change was necessary to stifle perception of America as an aggressor.

I want to emphasize here: **THIS IS THE INFORMATION WE DO HAVE REGARDING UCLA'S CONNECTIONS TO WEAPONS COMPANIES AND THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT.**

**While divestment is the most well-known demand of SJP, disclosure CANNOT be overlooked. If this is what we DO know, can you imagine what deals and information isn't publicly available?**

This next section I'll be focusing on how Israel's relationship with America contributes to much of our domestic issues. Since covering the impacts on the nation will break this subreddit due to the sheer amount of content, I'll just focus on how Israel's relations impact our city of Los Angeles.

**The Deadly Exchange** is a term coined by the Jewish Voice for Peace, the largest left-wing organization for anti-Zionist Jews. From their site, they define the Deadly Exchange as the coming together of ""...**police, ICE, border patrol, and FBI from the US with soldiers, police, border agents, etc. from Israel. In these programs, ‚Äúworst practices‚Äù are shared to promote and extend discriminatory and repressive policing practices that already exist in both countries, including racial profiling, massive spying and surveillance, deportation and detention, and attacks on human rights defenders.""**

[https://deadlyexchange.org/participant-profiles/](https://deadlyexchange.org/participant-profiles/)

Their site contains a massive and extensive report on relations between the LA Police Department and Israel. Officers from the LA Police Department participate in frequent exchanges between the US and Israel, receiving extensive training and even equipment. According to the report **"" The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles reported in 2014 on the reactions of LAPD officers who traveled to Israel and met with Israeli security companies, drone manufacturers, and Israeli police and military on a trip organized by i-HLS, the Israeli homeland-security news site. LAPD Deputy Chief Jose Perez spoke of the department‚Äôs technology ‚Äúwish list,‚Äù including a drone called the HoverMast, made by the Israeli company Spy Sapience, which can intercept wireless communications and is capable of facial recognition. Officials have acknowledged the civil liberties concerns with such technology. Horace Frank, commander of the LAPD Information Technology (IT) Bureau noted that the HoverMast ‚Äúhas its challenges: from a political standpoint, convincing our political leaders, and from a community standpoint, convincing the community that it‚Äôs not Big Brother watching over you.‚Äù**

Other ""inspirations"" provided by these exchanges with Israel include LAPD efforts to map the Muslim community in LA, implementing stop-and-frisks, and employing ""predictive policing"" protocols which has led to a massive rise in race-based profiling and over policing of black and brown communities **- in our city of Los Angeles**.

In sum - you absolutely cannot say that disclosure, divestment, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has nothing to do with UCLA or its students. If you don't give a damn about police brutality, the complicity of the school in war crimes, and other issues that the Palestinian Liberation movement fights against, by all means just say that.

Do not pretend that UCLA is not a battleground in the global fight for liberation. Do not pretend that this issue isn't intimately linked to the black and brown communities of LA. Do not pretend that the corruption and violence enacted by LAPD isn't rooted in our city's messed up relationship with the state of Israel.

Do not pretend you cannot do anything.",-0.83,Politics

See one of the main issues how loud it was because these girls had no sense of respect to keep their voices down when I was there. It was quite loud on the daily basis. And every time I spoke a lil loud one of them shush me. Why was it wrong for me to be a lil loud when they have been 
loud the whole year. They would also bring guests and they will stay until 12 am which is ridiculous because I would go to bed at that time. So I talked the RA to see if I could switch rooms and they deny me and said that we should hold a meeting to make rules. So that‚Äôs what we did but they started breaking them after awhile. Which is very frustrating and I can‚Äôt change rooms now because we are almost done with the quarter.

1cjfpzi,ucla,I made a bot to prevent brigading (pt. 2),"In the past few days I have seen some discussion of the events at UCLA that make it abundantly clear that the commenter has never stepped foot on our campus, and the stories they're telling are entirely made up. In order to sift through the brigaders, I made a bot that quickly summarizes a user‚Äôs activity history in r/UCLA to determine if they are a genuine UCLA community member, or simply here due to the protests. To use the bot, simply reply to any post or comment with ""!activitycheck"" and the bot will reply to you with a brief summary of the post/comment author's history in r/UCLA.

Some of you may have seen my earlier post regarding the bot I made. I deleted the post because I thought the bot was a lost cause, but I think the main issues are cleared up now.  The bot has limitations, so it may underestimate how active a user has been or underestimate how old their oldest activity in r/UCLA is, but for the most part it should provide a pretty clear indication of whether or not someone here began posting before or after the protests. Thanks to all the people on the previous post that pointed out the flaws in the bot, if anyone finds any other glaring issues please let me know. Due to Reddit API limitations, the data will never be 100% reliable for users who are extremely old or extremely active, but it should be reliable for most people.

EDIT: If you reply to this post with !activitycheck, you‚Äôll get information about my activity since I am the post author. If you want to know about your own activity, you must reply to your own comment or post with !activitycheck.  
EDIT 2: Looks like my account got mass reported or too many failed logins from attempted hackers or something, the bot was down for a little bit since Reddit forced me to reset my password, but all should be working now.",-0.14,Finance

1harjvy,ucla,Stop being proud of having 6 billion leftover swipes,"I was talking to this random and he was doing the zany face and sarcastically whining about having 70 extra swipes. I bluntly told my guy to donate them because I believe that the treats at the study are an absolute scam and the altruism found in donating would provide more value to his life. He clearly was a little pissed off. Yes, those are his swipes, so obviously he can do what he wants with them, but the concept of money that some people have is abysmal, yet they still complain about LA being ""expensive."" I am starting to wonder if complaining is just a tactic for people to seem relatable. 

The majority of kids here are from very wealthy backgrounds. There are plenty of middle class, and then few lower class, even though UCLA prides itself on its financial diversity. Now, this is a generalization, so take it with a grain of salt, but most of these kids are also probably getting their parents to pay for their education. If so, gloating about extra swipes is disgustingly disrespectful to your parents. What makes them any different from a friend who is helping you out? Too often we forget that they are people too and are doing extremely gracious acts of love for us. 70\*10 = 700 dollars! I couldn't even imagine wasting that much of my parents money and acting like its a silly gig.

All of us who are getting our education, housing, and food paid for should take a step back and realize how much a favor our parents (or scholarship, guardians, etc) are doing for us. Be grateful and understand that even though it might take more effort to plan out your meals for a quarter, it is taking a massive debt off your grave when you eventually feel guilty and glutinous in those somber moments of contemplation.

I'm totally cool with that and have supported her through it all. She definitely has the stats to get in so I'm proud of her, but its an insane obsession now. She's visited the school about 6 times and says how much she loves everything about the school and I mean EVERYTHING.
The campus, programs, people, architecture, history, traditions, colors, mascot, shape, smell?
She literally knows everything about the school and does UC Merced trivia with me when we're bored or asks me to help her write emails to professors she thinks she'll have next year to tell them how much she ""loves"" their research.
Last night we were doing it in bed, and everything was going smoothly. While she talked me through it I thought I heard her mumbling but couldn't really make out what she was saying.

1ct5vk6,ucmerced,College cost/spending (my experience),"I think I can provide a unique perspective on how much college costs, given that I kept track of every physical dollar I spent at UC Merced. 

Will list out roughly how much I spent in and around UC Merced per semester (not including tuition, Amazon, and housing)  as well as some details. I hope this will give incoming freshmen a good idea on possible budgeting and guestimates as to how much stuff costs: 


1st semester freshman year: $1520, I took the bus and biked to go outside for food and shopping at Raley‚Äôs/Target for groceries and essentials. Also got takeout once or twice a week.  I spent more this semester than my second semester because I opted to get school supplies and a couple of things to spruce up my dorm here and there. This was on top of the campus meal plan. You likely will get tired of eating the food on campus, so buying frozen food or food in town is definitely worth it. Also I think $200 of this might be from adding funds to my paypal, and that was used for mostly non-essentials. 

2nd semester freshman year: $940 Biked around town a lot more compared to taking the bus. Eats up a lot of time so I went out when I had time 1-3x a week. There‚Äôs a kitchen in some dorms, so buying ingredients once in a while to experiment college cooking is nice. I cheaped out to a certain extent, like I went out but I tried to stay away from meat when grocery shopping‚Ä¶ steak is good, but I didn‚Äôt wanna touch raw meat, freaks me out. Eating vegetarian saves a lot of money. Also got hooked on food truck food on campus, would get a $11 order nearly every tuesday from a Chinese food truck. Tastes better than the cafeteria food and had nice people. Meal plan comes with $80+ of CAT dollars, or campus money, you can use it in stores or food trucks on campus, which sorta negates food truck costs to a certain extent. 

3rd semester: sophomore $1760. I moved off campus into an apartment building called Merced Station. At the time, living there was cheaper than dorming on campus. Rent should still be comparable, but you can get an apartment easily 4x bigger than a dorm room with kitchen, fridge, and tv included for roughly the same cost. Had to go grocery shopping a lot more, but roommates who went to costco and split the costs of eggs and stuff helped keep things really cheap ($1760 seems like a lot, but this is without having to pay for a meal plan on campus $2000+ per year)

Merced Station kept pressuring him that rooms wont be available at the 729 rate but they were still available in August for 729.

1h6p357,ucmerced,Is it worth continuing if I end this semester with a 2.9 and no summer prospects?,"Hi. This is my third semester,  trying to get a degree in ess. Ive been having mental health issues and a mountain of personal failures, and because of that I think my cumulitive gpa this semester is going to be below a 3. I have no job, no extracurriculars, and no relationships with any professors(was too afraid to talk to them for a long time), which means that I won't be able to apply for any summer research or internships this December/January. I have no idea what to do. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get a job in my field if I can't get anything this year. I am trying to get into multiple labs on campus and I am not sure if I'll be allowed in if I have less than a 3.0. I can't even focus on doing okay on my finals cus I've been panicking so much. my degree will be expensive and worthless if I can't get a job or go to grad school or anything.

What would you do? Sorry for the rambly-ness and thank you for reading.

Edit: thank you all so much for giving me advice and reassurance, I am not sure exactly the steps I'm going to take but I feel calm enough to figure it out.",-0.83,Mental Health
1fv3uq8,ucmerced,UCM Accessibility Services,"Hi guys, ga_vindiesel here. Just wanted to talk about/promote the UC Merced Accessibility Services on campus located in ACS 140, Cubicle 128. We are the department to help accommodate you for all sorts of things, from academic accommodations, dining or housing accommodations. Our scope of accommodations are very broad for example we've accommodated a student with a broken leg to get a cart to transport them to classes and to academic accommodations if you have special permissions say for extra time on exams. Importantly if you have an ESA animal and live on campus make sure to register that animal through our department. Feel free to reach out to me and DM if you have any questions, there's all kinds of accommodations we provide. If you've gotten this far, thank you for reading all this and have a wonderful day.

We have seats left in all timeslots right now for Fall 24, but those will be going going gone with last-minute signups, so register ASAP.

Also, if you fulfilled ELWR and are able to take WRI 10, we do have a few spots left in our fall courses, including some at very desirable times of day.

1ckezug,ucmerced,How cooked am I? How should I prepare myself for EE?,"Incoming electrical engineering major here, I realize I need to get my act together.

I know engineering is rigorous. I love engineering regardless. I find electrical engineering utterly fascinating.

...but my study habits aren't all that great. I've suffered with ADHD my whole high school career, and was only recently diagnosed and am finally figuring out which medications work for me.

My mom said that when she went to college (she was an art major I believe at a local community college for reference) she took 9 credits per semester and was fine. She said that the people who took like 14+ credits were in over their heads.

This, has me worried. From my research it seems like engineering majors generally do 15/16+ credits per semester in order to graduate in 4 years.

I know that graduating in 4 years isn't everything, and I know that life happens. But like most people, I would like to graduate in 4 years.

The only AP credit I got in highschool was AP Biology, I wasn't one of the people that did every AP class. I just couldn't take the workload. Granted, I was struggling with ADHD at the time.

I'm currently doing alright in school, I could absolutely do better but I just haven't been able to get myself into high gear, senioritis is probably a big part of it.

If anyone was in my situation, how do I get my act together? How do I make sure I study properly and do it for 4 years? How's UCM in this regard?

I'm really excited for college but I've heard of many people making mistakes in their academic career as freshmen, and despite my desire to not make those same mistakes, I probably will regardless.

Any advice?",-0.27,Academics

I'm a second year poli-sci &amp; psych double major doing pre-law that got rejected from Cal and UCD my freshman year, so I chose to go to Merced. My roommates were more interested in getting transfer admissions, so I followed them (for a joke lowkey) despite not having any interest or motivation to actually transfer. By the time came, however, I was the only one among my roommates and friends who actually got into the schools we applied to (UCD, SB, SD and Irvine). I didn't want to transfer initially since I already did so much planning for my time here to get a double major that there would be no reason for me to transfer, alongside my comfortable life here as a student. The main reasons why I would transfer to Davis is its location closer to home, has more reputable programs, and due to the lack of things to do here at Merced (something that isn't a big deal to me, but still a factor). I'm trying to make a decision now since letters of reciprocity need to be made and more planning needs to be done, but I'd like to get other people's thoughts since I've now been given the opportunity.",-0.23,Academics

1frsm7e,ucmerced,"having trouble finding a path to UC merced after the air force.
","hello everyone. I am currently in the air force, 19 years old, i have a 4 year contract (Aug 2023-2027). I was born and raised in California but i joined the air force last year right after high school for college and am now stationed in Louisiana. Now my goal is to attend a UC after the air force to pursue and get a bachelors in Meteorology/atmospheric sciences but i would like to attend a CC first and then transfer to UC merced using the tag program, or SJSU, however, I realize that I'm encountering a lot of obstacles in my way. 



1. I can't be eligible for the tag program if i dont attend a cc in California, which is possible for me to apply to and do some classes online like math, english, etc, but not all classes are online because some science classes like chemistry have labs which require you to be physically there. 



2. If i do attend a cc in louisiana, which would be the easiest way to get my ccaf and knock out the requirements to transfer to a uc, i could do all the low div classes required to transfer including the classes that require  you to be there in person, but if i do that, the chance is high that i might not get accepted into a CSU or UC since california universities prefer students that attend cc in california. Or thats who they would rather pick first over me



3. this is not so much of a problem but a solution that i tried to come up on my own. My idea is that i will apply to a cc in California, maybe this upcoming Spring 2025, and i will do every required class i can online from here, and then when my contract with the af is done in mid 2027, i will go back home in California, apply to cc again and knock out the rest of the classes which would be most likely science in person. Hopefully this will take only a semester or 2 at most. After that i will apply to UCs using the tag program.



main goal of this is to knock out cc while im in the air force so i dont have to do 4 years of uni after the air force and i can reduce that to 2 years, since i will have done 2 years of college in the air force. Main goal is to do cc now and try and be eligible for the tag program so i can apply to uc in spring 2028 hypothetically. if UC doesnt work out, then i want to apply to SJSU main questions are is this plan possible to achieve? if this plan doesnt work for UC, will it work for CSUs like SJSU? , if you guys could give me tips and corrections i would apppreciate it VERY MUCH. I just need help. thanks for reading!",-0.43,Academics
1fcdemt,ucmerced,Is it worth me applying,"Hey everyone, I posted something similar like 50 days ago, but as I started my PIQs for fall 2025 applications, i was just curious where I stand, and my chances.

I know UC Merced is considered the lowest selective schools but because of the way I was messing around my freshman and sophomore year, I just want to know if it‚Äôs worth me applying or if i should just save the application fee.

As of now, I have a 3.23 UW 3.43 W gpa, but I plan to raise that up since I‚Äôm taking 6 dual enrollment courses and 1 AP class this year. I also have 42 community service hours, not a lot but just thought I‚Äôd throw that in there. Besides the 6 DE and 1 AP class i‚Äôm taking this year, i‚Äôve taken another AP class and 1 college level english class, and a digital art class which gave me articulated credit for community college.

My problem is, I haven‚Äôt really been involved with school events like clubs and things like that which I regret but there isn‚Äôt much I can do as a senior. Furthermore, 42 hours isn‚Äôt that many hours, but i still have time to increase that before I submit my application.

So with that, I am wondering if it‚Äôs worth even submitting an application to UCM for Fall 2025 or if i‚Äôm likely to get rejected and I should just do CC and transfer somewhere else.

1d67oci,ucmerced,Financial Aid/Grants,"Hi,

I was admitted to UCM this year and have already submitted my SIR. My award offer was just updated a few days ago, and it's showing me as having $0 in grants at all.

For context, my parents do make a reatively high amount of money, but what's not considered on FAFSA is that they have 3 other siblings to support aside from me - and even with their income cannot afford to pay $43,000 per year on my education out of pocket, meaning that I will have to take out loans to pay off my entire undergraduate education at UCM.

This wouldn't be surprising whatsoever at any other UC, but it's my understanding that UC Merced is typically regarded as being cheaper due to the financial aid available. I am simply wondering if there is anyone else in my current situation, and if there are any other pathways for cheaper tuition at UCM. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

**He's a fearful cat and very shy**, he **doesn't** smell, he doesn't bite or scratch unless you invade his privacy. He's a *very* good boy, just a bit talkative when hungry, and eats a LOT (he's chonky.)

My cat is up to date with all his vaccines and gets check ups annually, he also gets treated for ticks and flees monthly.

**I scoop the litter box every day at least once**, in the morning when i have time and 100% at night. he's a **very** clean boy. all i ask is **please PLEASE** **don't purposely scare him** or **touch him when i'm away/not in the same room**, and **keep our dorm room door closed when you leave** because he's scared of strangers and noises. I don't want him getting lost by accident. he is **microchipped**!

He will most likely hide when I'm gone, **please don't try to get him out**, he will come out when he feels comfortable/safe.

He has a automatic feeder, and water dispenser, he is very cute but don't give in to your temptation and his cute face and feed him, the vet says he is overweight and needs to go on a diet. he's a year into his diet journey!

I won't have people over and because my cat is a very fearful one so its **best** if you're also okay with not having people over as well.

I'm also fairly sensitive to loud noises so I hope we're able to keep the volume low, I use headphones for everything so you wont hear much noise coming from me, but I do sleep late.

**I stay up late**, studying, doing hw, etc. I sleep around **1-3 am**, I'm also a **light sleeper** so if you also stay up late, we can stay up late together and study.

1eb8lg7,ucmerced,Opportunities Fellowship Program: Calling coding enthusiasts (again) and everyone else!,"Hello, students of Merced!

My name is Vladimir, and you may recognize me from my [previous post calling for coding enthusiasts to apply for a student developer position on my team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/1dkpltz/calling_all_computer_science_and_coding/). In my previous post, all applicants needed to be able to work legally within the United States. However, this time around, this isn't an employment position but a fellowship with a stipend/award; i.e., it's technically a paid position.

I am a mentor for the Opportunities Fellowship Program (OFP) as my project was selected to be one of the many sponsored projects. This means, if you are interested in working with me but couldn't apply because you didn't meet the requirements, here's your opportunity to work with me! No work authorization needed and this opportunity is open to all undocumented and AB 540 students.

Do you qualify for OFP? From their website...

&gt; To be eligible to receive an OFP fellowship, UC Merced scholars must:
&gt;
&gt; - Be ineligible for federal financial aid.
&gt; - Have an ""AB 540"" exception and CA Dream Act on file.
&gt; - Have an EFC or student aid index equal to or less than the maximum to qualify for a Pell Grant ($6,000).
&gt; - Have sufficient financial need to receive the fellowship.

Source: https://ofp.ucmerced.edu/scholars

Not interested in coding? That's fine! The Office of Information Technology (OIT) alone has 8 other technical projects available to pick from. Not technical? There are [**67** projects total in this program](https://ofp.ucmerced.edu/sites/ofp.ucmerced.edu/files/page/documents/final_ofp_projects_list_ay_2024-25.pdf).

1g4j5yr,ucmerced,PSA: Insurance and out-of-network referrals,"This is a message to the UCM community regarding anyone seeking or requiring a referral to a provider that is out of the UCSHIP/Anthem Health network. I have had a long and arduous process dealing with insurance to get a referral to my ophthalmologist. Without the referral, I would be responsible for 100% of my bill. The steps, as told to me by insurance and health services, are as follows:

1. Get approval for a referral by either scheduling an appointment with a UCM physician or possibly by calling and getting a referral over the phone (2nd method has not been verified so YMMV).
2. Follow up to ensure the referral has been sent to Anthem by calling UCM Health Services. The referral DOES NOT appear in your health portal (I have been lied to saying that it will. It has not, to date, been reflected in my health portal). Be sure that the referral was sent before going to step 3.
3. Call your specific provider and inform them that they (the provider) needs to call Anthem and provide them 1) Your Anthem ID Number and 2) The referral code: 8780. Anthem should work with your provider to track down the referral. UCM Insurance and Health Services DOES NOT directly send referrals to your provider.
4. Wait anywhere from 0-35 days for the referral to be processed and any deductibles/co-pays to also be processed. Yes, 35 days is an accurate number due to billing cycles. Referrals are valid for about a year.

I very much want to go into research in particular, especially research on the topic of neurodivergence and the utilization of narratives as a means of creating assistive technologies--but I digress.

I have been told by said prior professor that UC Merced focuses greatly on the topic of narrative; however, I have seen little to nothing on UC Merced's website about narrative, narrative theory, or narratology almost at all, so I'm a bit unsure. For those of you who are already in the CogSci grad program, especially if any of you are there for a focus on narrative in particular, I would very much like to hear opinions about the program, general expectations I should have, etc. Is there truly any focus on narratives in the CogSci department, as my professor had suggested?

Kirk: ""You support public healthcare?""

Kirk: ""So we should pay for organ transplants?""

Student: **""Yeah!""**

Kirk: ""So we should pay for peoples' abortions?""

Student: **""Yeah!""**

Student: ""(hesitates)....yeah...""

Kirk: ""So we should pay for botox implants?""

Student: ""(hesitates)....yeah...""

(I leave to go home and rest my brain)

See here is the thing. Boobjobs, implants, and all that count as **cosmetic surgeries**, not a [medical operation](https://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cosmetic-surgery) and so are almost never covered by either healthcare or health insurance, unless you need it for like an injury, illness, or a disability. So your ""average taxpayer"" isn't going to pay for any of those things.

And this is why you see posts telling you to **STAY AWAY** from this whole chicanery. If you somehow knew that cosmetic surgeries aren't counted under healthcare, you could maybe poke a hole in his argument (Or he could edit it out on his video, wasting your time). But your average UCR student doesn't know that.

Now congrats, Charlie Kirk made you look like an idiot on Youtube and he's gonna be like: ""SeE?!? These LiBeRaL cOlLeGe sTuDenTs want you taxpayers to pay for their boobjobs!!! Checkmate Liberals!!!""

my final straw was when someone was asking about an announcement he made. like i said, he has an accent, so there were a few grammar mistakes but the announcement was easy to understand. however, this person (who turned out to be the mod of the server) made a rude comment about his grammar. i thought it was a little unnecessary so i just messaged back saying to be patient since english wasn‚Äôt his first language. a few people started agreeing with me and i thought that would be the end of it. a few hours later i notice the responded saying they didn‚Äôt mean it that way. whatever, i had no intention to respond, i just wanted to defend his language proficiency. but next thing i know the whole thread gets deleted and then i‚Äôm removed from the discord. so clearly they must‚Äôve felt called out lol. i reached out to the mod asking why i got removed and then i got blocked. then i tried to rejoin the server and they made it so no one else can join anymore. so now i have no access to notes if i‚Äôve missed a class.

First, I want to share a bit about my background: I completed my undergraduate studies at UC Riverside and am currently a PhD student at UCLA. I was actually admitted to UCLA for undergrad as well, but I chose UC Riverside due to the cost of living. Although my tuition was covered‚Äîsince I was raised in a low-income, single-parent household‚Äîliving expenses in Los Angeles were significantly higher than in Riverside, and that played a major role in my decision.

Now, as a PhD student at UCLA and a teaching assistant, I‚Äôve had the chance to work closely with students. One thing I‚Äôve observed is that, just like at UC Riverside, there are students here who are unmotivated or not particularly engaged. Of course, there are many incredibly bright and driven students at UCLA, but the idea that every student here is exceptional simply isn‚Äôt true. On average, I would say that students at UCLA tend to be more ambitious, but that doesn‚Äôt mean students at UC Riverside lack drive‚Äîit‚Äôs just a different overall environment.

I‚Äôve also served on admissions committees, where applications are typically reviewed by a mix of graduate students, retired counselors, and administrative staff‚Äîmany of whom hold bachelor‚Äôs or master‚Äôs degrees from lesser-known institutions. Surprisingly, professors are rarely involved in the initial review process, as they are often focused on research. When faculty are involved, it‚Äôs usually lecturers or adjuncts‚Äîpositions that unfortunately don‚Äôt carry the same weight or prestige as tenured roles. At times, I‚Äôve questioned whether some admissions decisions truly reflect a deep understanding of a student‚Äôs potential.

What I want to say is this: don‚Äôt be discouraged. Keep working hard. If you maintain strong grades and seek meaningful experiences, you‚Äôll find success‚Äîregardless of which UC campus you attend.

I just graduated from UCR, and I thought I‚Äôd feel proud, excited, or at least relieved‚Ä¶ but instead, I mostly feel sad, off, and kind of hollow.

Before the ceremony, I was laughing and chatting with people backstage‚Äîthose small, unexpected moments felt light and genuine. But once I walked out, stood in line, and crossed the stage, something in me just felt disconnected. It was like I was performing celebration instead of actually feeling it.

Afterward, once everything ended and the crowd faded, I just felt this strange heaviness in my chest. I started crying and didn‚Äôt really know why. I think I expected graduation to feel like this huge, joyful release, but instead it felt kind of surreal‚Ä¶ and quiet.

But honestly‚Ä¶ one thing made me smile and stick with me:
Someone showed up to graduation in flip-flops. ü©¥
In the middle of all the nerves and pageantry, that tiny act of casual realness made me genuinely happy. I don‚Äôt know your name, but you made my day feel lighter.

1n5ygm9,ucr,advice: don‚Äôt use AI to write an email request for letter of rec from faculty,"

I just got an email like this and thought students should get this advice. A grammatically flawed but authentic email is better than an AI written email. If you really want someone to agree to write for you, show up for office hours and ask in person. Makes a massive difference.

It might seem like AI is helping here, but it isn‚Äôt. 

[Appreciating the discussion. 

Letters of rec can make a huge difference in esp grad school admissions. My advice here is somewhat field specific, but colleagues in STEM complain about this too.

If folks need a model, feel free to cut and paste this: 

‚ÄúDear Professor [name], 

I was a student in [class/year]. I would love to talk with you about my applications to grad school/for XYZ job. I need [#] letters of rec, and am hoping you can write for me. I am happy to come to office hours, zoom, or correspond here on email. 

Sincerely,‚Äù

A request can be that simple.

If you are gonna use AI, at least make the email less than 100 words. LOL]

He said things like, ‚ÄúYou really want to live in Riverside?‚Äù and called it a downgrade. Then he went on about how UCR ‚Äúisn‚Äôt that big of a deal‚Äù because of the acceptance rate, and kept comparing it to other UC schools, saying how much better they are and despite the effort I put in highschool, I could‚Äôve slacked and still ended up at UCR. 

It honestly hurt because I was genuinely proud and happy, and it felt like he just wanted to tear it down. What made it more frustrating is that he‚Äôs planning to go to community college, which is completely fine, but he‚Äôs constantly talking about school prestige and even told me I shouldn‚Äôt visit home on weekends because I‚Äôd get too homesick and end up dropping out because I‚Äôll get too attached to my hometown and my parents since Riverside is ‚Äúghetto‚Äù.

1kiyo83,ucr,My Thoughts on CHARLIE KIRK  @ UCR,"I‚Äôm a libertarian student who values honest political dialogue, so I attend club events hosted by Republicans, Democrats, and libertarians. I will be attending the movie screening from SJP on Monday for example.  I bounce around clubs constantly exploring new ideas.  I was excited to hear Charlie Kirk speak and even had a hat signed, but I left the event disappointed.

Kirk‚Äôs team filtered audience questions in a way that felt intellectually dishonest. My question‚Äîwhether firing Jerome Powell would actually improve the economy and interest rates‚Äîwas rejected for supposedly not being ‚Äúdisagreeable enough.‚Äù(I think it's a terrible idea for the FED not to be independent). Other thoughtful questions were also screened out, while students with fringe or poorly framed arguments were ushered to the microphone, creating easy sound bites rather than genuine debate. Many of my friends had their questions shut down, who would do an excellent job debating.

There are so many students on this campus with amazing ideas and they are very intelligent, and his team intentionally portrayed us badly.  There are people in this subreddit who could ""beat"" him in certain areas of US politics, but his team protects him from you even getting the chance.

Political discourse only works when all sides can challenge each other in good faith. By hand-picking questions to produce viral clips, Kirk‚Äôs crew undermined that goal and short-changed the very students who showed up ready for an honest exchange of ideas.  His media in my opinion is republican porn not honest debate after seeing his event in real life.

Glad to have attended because it gave me real-life experience of American politics.

I also had a 3-hour O-Chem lab after that (you can imagine how down I was, lmao). The time frame HAD to be between 4-5 PM yesterday since the midterm was exactly an hour. So realistically, the dude had like a 10-30 minute head start. Also, it was a midterm, so the place must have been crowded, AND I had a metal U-lock, so I have ZERO clue how he did it so fast and without anyone noticing (maybe people just don‚Äôt care, lmao).

Long story short, I had an Apple AirTag hidden in the bike, and I saw that he was about 4 miles away when I got out of the midterm at 5 (at the Danco Scrap Dealer, lmao‚Äîis that where all stolen bikes get taken?).

I called UCPD and reported the location, along with my bike registration number and other details. Then the cop directly called me, and I had to give consent for them to prosecute (I didn‚Äôt know they needed my permission to arrest the guy‚Äîoops).

Three hours later, I finished the depressing lab and saw that my bike was now at UCPD. I got a text saying the guy had been CAUGHT and ARRESTED (God bless UCPD, bro). So I sprinted to UCPD and picked up my dirty and messed-up bike (idk what he did, but the whole thing was covered in dirt and sand, and he somehow snapped off my left pedal). It still worked since I had to ride it home, so it couldn‚Äôt have been that bad. Didn‚Äôt get my lock or helmet back either, but that just whatever lmao.

It‚Äôs just nice to see justice delivered once in a while. I know a lot of people here naturally hate thieves. I actually have experience with this because my old (fixie) bike got stolen during the summer while I was doing summer research. I had a flimsy cable lock with no tracker, so yeah, that one was lost forever (apparently, they found the wheel of my bike somewhere, lmao).

So yeah, moral of the story: if you have an expensive ride, make sure to do all the steps. Register it with the UCR bike registry, get a good lock (I‚Äôm getting TWO this time), and get a tracker of some sort. UCPD said it would‚Äôve been hard to find the bike without the tracker (duh), so get one‚Äîthey‚Äôre like $20.

1mcgiw6,ucr,"Under pressure, UC admits a record number of Californians; racial diversity remains strong","The University of California has admitted its largest-ever class of first-year California students for fall 2025, a more than 7% increase over last year.

The system-wide admission rate for California first-year students ‚Äî even taking in highly competitive campuses including Los Angeles and Berkeley ‚Äî increased to 77% from 70% last year. Overall, UC offered seats to 180,382 first-year and transfer students from California and other states and nations.

But admissions growth is happening as UC contends with hiring freezes, tough budgetary times and federal scrutiny over diversity programs. Questions continue to loom over billions in federal grants amid Trump administration claw-backs and multiple federal government investigations probing allegations regarding antisemitism, use of race in admissions and sources of foreign funding.

Read the full admissions breakdown at the link: [https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-28/uc-fall-2025-admissions-record-number-from-california-international-students-racial-diversity](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-28/uc-fall-2025-admissions-record-number-from-california-international-students-racial-diversity)¬†",-0.05,Politics

But luckily i made it back to my dorm cause as WE KNOW it can‚Äôt go in the dorm areas. 

If you do not know about the backstory of the midnight mule basically back in 1907 during the citrus experiments those damn scientists were experimenting with the tangerine trees and created a lethal variant of the fruit, and a pack of donkeys got into the orchard where they were located, with the entire pack perishing‚Ä¶ except one. This mare was filled with vengeance and maliciousness against all UCR. (Ie the Malicious Mare of the Midnight Mule) And long story short the mare procreated with one of those damn scientists creating a abomination with the mind of man and the body of a mule. And the mare imparted its desire for vengeance on the young colt. 

IF YOU DO ENCOUNTER THE MULE ON CAMPUS you can use the emergency blue lights on campus to repel it cause AS WE KNOW the light is able repel raccoons, coyotes,crazy people, and the like ya know. But as I said earlier, the MIDNIGHT MULE is able to speak and project HORRIFIC visions in your mind, which i cant DARE to repeat to ya‚Äôll for fear of your sanity. But BE WARNED IF IT CATCHES YOU IT CONSUMES YOUR BODY AND MIND, ABSORBING YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE IT AGAINST ITS NEXT VICTIMS!!!

1mfh5zq,ucr,Reflections from an alum. I love UCR but we really need to talk about the purpose of going to college.,"**TLDR:** I am very grateful for having gone to UCR. UCR gave me amazing research opportunities, community, and mentorship. That said, I wish someone had explained more clearly what college was actually preparing us for. I feel a little misled by all the career opportunities they promised.

**BACKGROUND**

I graduated in 2021 with a CMDB degree.

After undergrd, I got certified as a psych tech, then did a whole master's program. Now I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker.

I will always be grateful for my time at UCR. I was a commuter. UCR saved me a lot of money, taught me how to calculate freeway drives to avoid traffic, and taught me how to parallel park. UCR taught me street smarts, literally. I am a MUCH smarter driver thanks to what I learned commuting.

**I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THE COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE AT UCR**

I met people from so many different backgrounds. I learned about communities that were just 30 minutes away from where I'd grown up that I had never met anyone from before. I also met people from all around LA County, places I had never heard of, even though I had been to LA at least 200 times. I learned so much from other people. Oh my god I'm getting emotional and nostalgic just thinking about this.

**UCR HAD TONS OF RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES**

UCR had a lot of research opportunities, especially in CNAS. I felt like a real scientist and not like a toddler in a lab coat playing with pipettes. And there was a lot of mentorship with that.

**WHAT WAS UCR ACTUALLY PREPARING ME FOR?**

I mean this with love and reflection, I really wish someone had sat me down and explained what going to UCR was actually going to prepare me for.

Let me be clear. I am not dragging UCR. I will defend my alma mater against anyone who tries to make us feel bad about it. And believe me, I have shut people up over that. But I think we need to have an honest conversation about what college is supposed to prepare you for. It‚Äôs like asking people what love means. If you asked fifteen students what college is for and actually made them think before answering, you would get at least ten completely different answers.

I‚Äôm using UCR as my reference point here because that‚Äôs where I went, but I know the same goes for all the UCs and probably other schools too.

**COLLEGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR... (of course it's for multiple things)**

* College is supposed to be for helping you build skills that can help get you a job.

* College is supposed to help you find summer jobs and internships that look cute on a resume.

* College is where you learn about different careers and figure out what you actually want to do, which might be the complete opposite of what you wrote in your senior yearbook quote.

Oh my God I did not expect this post to make me so nostalgic. I'm going to be crying by the time I finish writing this. And yes, I'm crying now that I'm reviewing this before posting.

* College is for networking both in your field and in other fields.

* College is for GE classes that feel more stressful than your major.

* College is for major classes that always fill up before you have a chance to register, and the registrar's website crashes.

* College is where you learn about injustices in American history, realize a lot of those injustices are still happening today, and start to understand how history affects people today.

* College is for learning how to advocate for yourself and for others.

* College is for becoming someone your high school self might not recognize but would still be proud of. By the time you graduate, you are absolutely supposed to give your 18-year-old self a fist bump.

* **And yes, college is also for the school to make money off of you.**

Let us not pretend. Every time we bought parking passes, textbooks, or got scammed into an online access code, I could feel the school winking at me and saying ‚Äúthanks babe.‚Äù They are not subtle in how they try to make money off of students.

**I THINK IT WAS MISLEADING HOW THEY TOLD US WE'D HAVE A LOT OF CAREER OPTIONS**

During CNAS orientation, it really felt like we were being ushered into this golden buffet of career opportunities. They were honest that not all the pre-meds would make it into medical school, which was tough love that we needed. But they made it sound like we‚Äôd all just naturally fall into other glamorous careers if med school didn‚Äôt work out. I think that was a little misleading.

Then later on, in junior and senior years, I started hearing this talking point that UCs are for research and CSUs are for jobs. Maybe that‚Äôs true. Maybe it‚Äôs not. But no one from UCR told me that when I was a senior in high school contacting faculty thinking about which school to go to.

**SO HERE I AM NOW**

I'm still grateful and still proud of that girl who chose UCR because it was close, it was a great school, it was affordable, and I knew I would figure it out eventually. I think I did figure things out.

**IF YOU‚ÄôRE FIGURING THINGS OUT TOO, YOU WILL BE OKAY!!**

If you are reading this and trying to figure out your own path, just know that it is okay if it does not look like what you thought it would. Sometimes the detour becomes the destination. Either way, you are doing great. Also, if you're still reading this, sorry for how long this post is, holy shit!!

And if no one told you today, you are allowed to question the system and still love your alma mater. You are allowed to feel proud of your degree and also wonder how it benefits you. You are allowed to ask for more without being ungrateful.

Those are my two cents. I'm just posting it here because it might be interesting for some of you to read.",0.43,Academics

1k41be1,ucr,2024-25 asucr elections,"I attended the asucr candidate debate out of curiosity and for the free boba lol ... but I ended up staying for the entire event. I left the event surprised, disappointed, and unimpressed. I read these reddit posts about ksig members running for elections and I didn't know they were true until I saw several candidates who seemed to be connected to KSIG (though I can't confirm that for sure) with my own eyes. Let me just say that the entire debate felt more like a performance than a serious discussion about student needs.

During the marketing and promotions debate, one candidate simply repeated what asucr seems to be doing(?) He said one way he can think of to improve asucr or sum was to give out incentives in return for students needing to follow their Instagram. As someone who already got a sweater from their tabling, I didn‚Äôt see how that was supposed to create *new* engagement. It felt like recycled ideas with no real vision for improvement.

The finance debate was even more concerning. The guy candidate gave off an unprofessional and dismissive vibe. He was smacking his gum during the whole event and his speech, coughing during other non-ksig candidates' speeches, and making it painfully obvious he wasn‚Äôt taking the role seriously. It was such a joke. He really said, ‚Äúat the end of the day, I‚Äôm an accounting bro, not a finance bro.‚Äù He also suggested cutting funding from inactive clubs and raising the general fund to $1,500, but the whole thing sounded contradictory. It honestly felt like a popularity contest, where connections mattered more than qualifications.

As for the presidential debate, there was unrealistic promises like the whole talk of solving parking and bringing in a football team, without addressing the actual feasibility of those goals. Campaigning on the idea that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre UC rejects‚Äù only to try and compensate with empty gestures felt like a major red flag.

I'm new to this school, but this entire experience left me concerned. It‚Äôs frustrating to think that these dudes are running for student government like it's another rush event, but this time, the only qualification is knowing how to Venmo themselves our student fees.

1loocj3,ucr,No Job,"Well a month after graduation, I am still jobless. I participated in business clubs, networking events, career fairs, and tried to network through my professors during the two years I attended UCR. They have severely failed in setting students up with reliable and opportunistic companies. Im sure UCLA business students do not have this problem. I visited the career Center 4 times this last year for interviews with crappy companies that only off commission sales or cashiering positions. Handshake, the schools' ""exclusive"" Job board, is polluted with the most insulting trash companies trying to lowball students for positions that wont ammount to anything. How can the business school call themselves ""renowned"" when their alumni cant even get a job in the city they went to school in. I had many professors saying ""accepting a job that pays less than 70k brings down the prestige, image of the school"" well you show me an entry level job paying 70k that has less than 1k applicants. Professors either have worked only in academia, or gatekeep their networks of industry professionals/companies. It is such a shame, I did not grind for 5 associates and 2 BAs for this shit. On the last note, business is becoming, or already has become, a skills based economy. UCR professors do not teach or focus on real world application skills that will make their students more competitive. While they start with the basics, it never goes indepth enough/exampled in ways so students can see how these skills are being used in their respective industries.  

I have been to every resume workshop, gotten no less than Bs in all my courses. I track my applications in an excel sheet that logs responses automatically, use Ai to find the best way to tweak my resume and cover letter FOR EVERY APPLICATION (now im not having it write it for me, I personally recreate my resume everytime). My sheet says I've applied to 297 jobs with NOT ONE CALL OR INTERVIEW! I started applying at the beginning of this year thinking id have something lined up by the time I graduate. I am so utterly depressed, desperately cold calling hiring managers all around the IE and LA or any major city in the country.

To refresh your memory, in the second half of orientation they take us into a large room where we're asked to line up against the wall. Then invasive questions are projected onto the screens and we're asked to step forward if we resonate with them.

Some examples of the questions include:

Do you or someone in your family have a history of mental illness?

Are you or your parents immigrants?

Have you or someone in your family ever been incarcerated?

Do you feel safe when shopping alone?

Have you been honked at or whistled at in public?

Are your parents proud of you?

Were you raised by a single parent?

Are you a parent?

And the cherry on top was ""Do you feel accepted at UCR?""

At this point I barely know anything about the school except that a random person across the room is a queer parent who was in foster care and doesn't believe their parents are proud of them.

I'm tired of hearing yall talk and laugh so loud that we can't hear her. I can even tell it upsets her and she tries to speak over yall, but she can't. 

She's a really nice and understanding professor and yall treat her so horrible. If you guys don't want to learn, then don't come to class. Or if you want to talk to your friends, don't talk to them with your outside voice. You're capable of whispering, so whisper! 

You're the same people who complain that the professor doesn't teach us anything, but you guys don't even pay attention. You spend the entire 50 minutes talking, laughing, and being a damn nuisance. How can she teach us when we can't even hear her over you? 

Don't blame the professor for your inability to stay quiet and pay attention for 50 minutes. 50 damn minutes. 

The others in our class are also frustrated beyond belief. Like it's so annoying. Please be more mindful of the others in our class and especially our professor, who is trying her best. 

So yeah.

Sincerely, 

A fellow classmate trying to learn.",-0.83,Academics

I‚Äôd consider myself a bit of a gym rat, and I used to be proud of my physique‚Ä¶until I met him. He‚Äôs always walking around the house shirtless, which has made me feel a tad insecure, to say the least.

The other night, he brought his girlfriend over (who, frankly, might also be stronger than me). We were chatting, and they casually asked about my dating life. I was already feeling a bit jealous, so in a moment of panic, I blurted out that I had a girlfriend too. That was true at one point, but all my past relationships have ended thanks to my Warhammer 40k and League addiction.

Now, here‚Äôs where it gets tricky: his girlfriend suggested we should do a double date. Without thinking, I agreed, and now we‚Äôre set to go to Su‚Äôs Bowl on Thursday.

1ddm320,UCSantaBarbara,A few thoughts on the protests,"In case you missed it, the protestors already declared [victory](https://www.instagram.com/p/C78Df80JSAw/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) last week and danced around like they just negotiated a ceasefire or something. Congrats on the huge win, gang! A purely symbolic resolution for divestment from AS which doesn‚Äôt really seem to [invest](https://budget.as.ucsb.edu/files/2023/07/2023-2024_Budget.pdf) much anyway. What a feather in their cap! AS is an entirely separate nonprofit from UCSB and has literally no say in how the university spends or invests its money. But still, once word gets out, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Netanyahu unconditionally surrenders. 

This group could be protesting a mile down the road at Raytheon or in front of the State Department offices in LA - locations and workers that have far more relevance than ucsb - but they‚Äôd rather upend finals week (especially for the students taking their exams through the Disabled Students Program in Girvetz yesterday) and commencement to make it about them. Because it‚Äôs always about them. Look again at their post:  ‚ÄúWe made history!‚Äù and ‚Äúthank you to the generations of organizers that made this possible.‚Äù What precisely did they accomplish? AS passing a resolution in favor of divestment is purely symbolic and has no actual impact. It‚Äôs all in service of their self-aggrandizement. And I know what you‚Äôre thinking: why would a group that puts up empty tents to make it look like their encampment has way more dedicated support than it actually does ever feel the need to heavily exaggerate their accomplishments? 

The protestors are straight up lying to you when they say your tuition is funding the war and they know it. Just like when they say ‚ÄúYANG FUNDS GENOCIDE‚Äù or that stealing from (sorry, ‚Äúliberating‚Äù) the dining commons is to take money away from defense contractors. 

The whole call for divestment is absolute nonsense. Student tuition has never been a part of the system wide or ucsb endowment. System wide is composed of donor funds and the employee funded pension. The latter is entirely donor funds. All of these funds have a designated purpose like a scholarship or a chair; it is not just a pot of money for the university to use at any point as it sees fit. The office of the cio has a [fiduciary responsibility to manage the investment pool minimizing risk and maximizing return](https://dailybruin.com/2024/05/14/uc-regents-disclose-investments-in-weapons-manufacturers-amid-calls-to-divest), not based on the politics of a group that has no actual skin in the game. 

UCSB has no lucrative deals with Raytheon, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, or any other defense giant. The university receives a few grand in donations to support capstone projects, not weapons research. The protestors massively overstate UCSB‚Äôs support from these corporations. Look around campus, does anyone honestly think the university get millions of dollars regularly from any company, let alone hundreds of millions from Raytheon? If it did, you‚Äôd be taking econ or bio 1 in Raytheon Hall. 

So all that being said: what‚Äôs going on with everything this week? The protestors want to force the university to call the police. That‚Äôs the goal. They know once summer hits, they‚Äôll have no audience so there‚Äôs a ticking clock to force a reaction that will allow them to sustain enough momentum to carry through summer. Their antics will get more desperate throughout the week to provoke a heavy handed response from the administration and create outrage that gets media attention and builds support for their group. I wonder where they learned that strategy. 

The [destruction](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8DSX-nSsUb/?igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) yesterday, the threat to disrupt a final in Campbell today, and the inevitable havoc that this week will bring is their entire self-important ‚Äúmovement‚Äù in microcosm: pointless noise and performative bluster built on a foundation of misinformation that disrupts the lives and studies/work of people who have nothing to do with what‚Äôs happening in Gaza, turning a potentially sympathetic audience against the cause. It accomplishes nothing and is ultimately as immaterial to the outcome of the conflict in the Middle East as they are.",-0.93,Politics

All of you pledging Sig Pi will get fucked up terribly during the initiation at the end.

The pledging process is difficult but nothing too bad for the whole quarter bc they are manipulating and tricking you.

Endless amounts of milk, corn, and even water you will have to drink to the point that you will have to ‚Äúpull trig‚Äù to keep going and eating.

I have a friend who was heavily involved in their church for some time and he brought me to one of their Friday night worship services that was in the back of a house on DP, and they‚Äôd talk about the people of UCSB like they were evil and that hell is making its way into them because they go to parties. They‚Äôre so disconnected and uncultured.It‚Äôs such a dark way to view innocent kids hanging out with each other from class or after a sunset surf.

They have expanded into taking up like 10 houses around IV, full of older people who never went to UCSB but feel entitled to take housing from students to ‚Äúsave‚Äù them. 10 houses could house like 100 people. My lab partner and old housemate were living in their cars because there was nothing left. These people need to leave IV. They also refuse to speak to/hangout with UCSB students outside of their Friday burger night (where they stand on their platform and judge people walking by for partying and what they‚Äôre wearing), so they only hangout with each other when they say their only purpose is to be in the IV community. It is so toxic and disgusting, their hate for people that aren‚Äôt in their religion is disguised in selflessness. One of the church people who were living on the beach called themselves a missionary living in a slum. ?????. I also looked up their church on Instagram theyre opening a thrift store in downtown IV for the ‚Äúseculars to interact with the sacreds‚Äù which really puts me off. There‚Äôs also non-consented pictures of drunk people on their account. No one who‚Äôs not in their exclusive group would feel safe there. I didn‚Äôt.

Sopper was appointed as the head coach for UC Santa Barbara Gauchos' women's gymnastics team on August 31, 2001. UC Santa Barbara, just days earlier on August 10, had announced the immediate discontinuation of the program, but it was re-instated on August 13.  Despite a pay-cut of over 70%, a salary of $98,000 as a lawyer to her new $28,000 women's gymnastics salary, and UC Santa Barbara officials stating the program's termination in a year, Sopper agreed to take the job.

On September 11, 2001, Sopper was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 en route to Los Angeles International Airport to begin her new career; however, the plane was hijacked and deliberately crashed into The Pentagon.

update: they regraded my stuff and my random B went to an A!! thank God I knew what I was doing, lol

Dear Students from MATH 4A Spring 24,

We are writing to communicate with you the latest information regarding grade assignments for the course from last spring.  The Department of Mathematics is well aware of the numerous issues in the course regarding timely feedback and proper assessment of your work.  We have come to learn that with the exception of one homework assignment and the various discussion section assignments, almost none of your work was graded.  That includes 3 homework assignments, 2 midterm exams and the final exam.

The Department would like to acknowledge and apologize for the complete failure of the instructor to carry out his duties to assess your work and assign a grade that is properly based on that work.  We believe very strongly in the notion that all students have a right to the opportunity to learn demanding mathematics content.  And timely feedback on your progress in that learning is an essential part of your growth as a mathematician and a responsibility that all instructors in our department share.  Ignoring grade assignments for the moment, we have failed all students in the class in that regard.  And we deeply apologize for that.

The Department unfortunately cannot go back and make your experience in the class better.  But we certainly wanted to make sure that everyone has a grade that properly reflects their work in the class.  We have not quite yet completed the work of that, but we are very nearly finished.  We know you have been very patient up to this point, and we are asking you to be patient just a few more days.  At the same time, we wanted to make sure to communicate with you all to let you know what to expect when everything is done and we can share it with you.

Well after the completion of the course, the Math Department was able to access both Canvas and Gradescope.  We were also able to obtain the paper versions of the two midterm exams and the final exam that were taken in person.  The Department requested additional funds from the Office of Undergraduate Education in order to hire graduate students to complete the work of grading the exams.  That office granted the funding, but only authorized us to do this for students who received a B+ or below in the course because the funding is limited.

This means that if you received an A or A- grade in the course, and as we did not receive the resources to determine what that A- was based on, your grade will be an A. Later we will share the Canvas and Gradescope sites with the entire class.  When this happens, if you are in the A/A- category, you will probably be able to see your work, but it will not have been graded.  Because of this, you may see some zeroes for some assignments, and your course grade on the site will look poor as a result.  Rest assured that we will not be changing your official grade, except from A- to an A, with the Registrar‚Äôs Office.  See even if it says F on Canvas, you can safely ignore that.

For those of you who received a B+ or below in the spring, the Department hired graduate students to grade all of the work that we could find and access.  We want to let you know what we did.

Midterm 2 and Final Exam:  We were able to find the original paper exams of Midterm 2 and the Final Exam.  We scanned these and uploaded them to Gradescope.  We graded them and recorded those scores in Canvas.   If your exam is not in Gradescope or Canvas, it means that you either received an A/A- grade in the course already, or it means that we could not find your exam.

Midterm 1: The Department is aware of the severe irregularities that occurred in the first midterm of the course.  We were able to obtain the original paper exams from the in-person exam, although we are well aware that not all of you had the opportunity to take that exam.  The instructor granted students the opportunity to take a Makeup Midterm 1, which was offered remotely, and we found those uploaded already on Gradescope.  They had been graded. For most of you, your Midterm 1 score will be your score for Makeup Midterm 1.  If you did not take the Makeup Midterm 1 exam, then we attempted to find your paper exam from the collection of in-person exams, and if we found it, we graded it.   In that case, we used that exam score for Midterm 1.

Homework: For the homework, we simply did not have resources to go through and assess all of your homework problems.  For that reason, we gave you full credit if you turned in anything at all.  We did not go through and look at it.  If you did not turn in anything, you got a zero.  The syllabus says that at least one homework would be dropped, and we went ahead and dropped two.

Discussion Worksheets: It appeared that there were grades on Canvas for your discussion worksheets.  We will take those scores and add them into the total.  Again, the syllabus says to drop at least one, and we will drop two.

Again, we are not quite yet done.  There are still just a few loose ends we have to tie together.  If you go on either Gradescope or Canvas right now, assuming you can get access, please don‚Äôt read too much into anything you see there.  We are still organizing it all.  We will let you know when it is ready to be shared properly.

At the end of our work, those students who originally earned a B+ or below will see a new grade on Canvas.  If this new grade is better than the one you received last spring, then we will change that grade with the Registrar.  If the new grade is worse, the grade you have from the Registrar now will not change.  All of that is to say that your letter grade will only improve as a result of all this work.  It will not go down under any circumstance.

Finally, we have one last request of you all.  We hope you can find it in your heart to forgive Prof. Morrison for this failure.  He has been a trusted colleague and has done great service for this University and for the Department of Mathematics over the years.  He has been an amazing researcher and a great teacher in the past as well.  The degree of irresponsibility shown from him last spring is very unusual for him.  Rest assured that he has been sanctioned as a result of all this, but he is still a valued member of our Department and University.  You are right to be angry, but please don‚Äôt hold it against him too much. Remember that we all fail at times and then we too need forgiveness.

You will hear from the Department again very soon as we finish this process.  Thank you so much for your patience in all this, and Happy Holidays.

1d7neq9,UCSantaBarbara,Urgent Appeal to Reconsider Commencement Location and Ticketing Decision,"Dear UC Santa Barbara Administration,

I am writing to express my profound outrage and disappointment at the last-minute decision to relocate the Commencement ceremonies from the iconic lawn bordering the lagoon to the unattractive Recreation Center Fields, and the enforcement of an arbitrary six-ticket limit for guests. This announcement, coming a mere 12 days before Commencement, is not only irrational but also a blatant disregard for the students and families who have meticulously planned for this milestone for months. To offer ZERO explanation is not only extremely offensive but embarrassing, as UCSB cannot even take accountability for disrupting its students.

The lawn bordering the lagoon is not just a location; it is a symbol of the beauty and uniqueness of UC Santa Barbara. It has been the cherished venue for countless graduations, providing a breathtaking backdrop that reflects the essence of our university. Moving the ceremony to the drab and uninspiring Recreation Center Fields strips away the dignity and significance of this once-in-a-lifetime event.

Moreover, the six-ticket limit is an unprecedented imposition that shows a complete lack of empathy and foresight. Families have made extensive travel and accommodation arrangements well in advance, often at great financial cost due to Santa Barbara's exorbitant prices. This abrupt change leaves families in a lurch, unable to alter plans without incurring further financial loss and logistical nightmares.

The distress and chaos caused by this decision are palpable. Graduates are desperately scouring social media, begging for extra tickets, which is both humiliating and unjust. This scramble detracts from what should be a joyous celebration and tarnishes the reputation of UC Santa Barbara as an institution that values its students. It also creates an environment for students to be unfairly scammed, by people taking advantage of their desperation. 

If a change in location was truly necessary, why was the soccer stadium not considered? With 17,000 seats, this is a more than accessible option. Besides, it's about time the stadium sees some use. Such a move would have at least provided a venue that respects the significance of the occasion and accommodates the needs of the graduates and their families. The current choice of the Recreation Center Fields is not just disappointing; it is insulting.

I implore the administration to reconsider this decision immediately. The setup for the original location had already begun this past month, indicating that this change is unnecessary and unprecedented. This change, made without explanation, after years of tradition, undermines the significance of our Commencement. Show the Class of 2024 that UC Santa Barbara values and respects their hard-earned achievements and the sacrifices their families have made.

The Class of 2024 does not deserve this added burden after all we have endured. Many of us lost our high school graduation in 2020 due to the pandemic and have already been deprived of numerous traditional milestones. This Commencement was supposed to be our moment of redemption, a chance to finally celebrate our achievements properly. Instead, we are faced with unnecessary stress and frustration. This is not just about a location; it is about honoring tradition, showing respect, and demonstrating that UC Santa Barbara cares about its students. I urge you to reconsider this incomprehensible decision. 

Sincerely,

Class of 2024

The line for parents to get in to the commencement green at 12:30-1 wrapped past the SRB, past theater and dance, all the way to the library and then wrapped back around to the srb. They weren‚Äôt even checking tickets and were barely checking bags, like they didn‚Äôt have the staff to do it properly so they were just letting people in (and it still wasn‚Äôt moving quick enough). There were numerous odd gaps in the announcement of names and an inconsistency with when people stood and moved. The camera shot was angled so badly so that you got this weird side profile along with the people who had just walked obstructing the lower shot of the camera as they walked off to the side. No one actually walked on the stage either just this weird lower ramp. No degree projected on the screen, just a name. Also everyone left after they walked. At other schools I‚Äôve seen them project the school student image, the name and degree, and live announce the name as students walk. Then have all the students be re-seated and have the tassels/cap throw at the end. Other ceremonies have been much more organized it was just a hot mess.

I'm really nervous about applying to UCSB and I wanted to ask if I stand a chance. Please be honest, even if it‚Äôs bad news. Here's a little about me:

* **Academics:** I graduated high school at age 10 with a 6.0 GPA (on a 4.0 scale). I dual-majored in Quantum Philosophy and Astrophysical Arts in undergrad, finishing my Ph.D. in Nano-Hyperdimensional Time Travel by 16. Currently pursuing my second Ph.D. in Differential AI Ethics.
* **Test Scores:** I scored 2500 on the SAT because I found the hidden bonus questions. My ACT was a 72 because I took two exams at the same time and combined the scores.
* **Extracurriculars:**
   * President of the International Society for Speech and Debate.
   * Founded a nonprofit teaching underprivileged communities in Africa to code in Python.
   * Soloed Beethoven's *Symphony No. 9* on a harp made entirely of recycled toothbrushes and duct tape.
   * Built a rocket in my backyard that landed on the moon; now working on one to reach Pluto
   * Lead actor, director, and scriptwriter in my town's production of *Hamlet*
* **Community Service:**
   * Cured cancer.
   * Donated one of my kidneys to every hospital in the country (I regrow them using CRISPR).
   * Planted 5 billion trees last summer.
* **Awards:**
   * Nobel Prize (Physics, Literature, and Peace ‚Äî same year).
   * Time Magazine's *Person of the Year* (3 years in a row).
* **Essays:** I wrote my personal statement as a perfectly rhyming epic poem in iambic pentameter. Admissions officers reportedly wept when they read it.
* **Letters of Recommendation:** My recommenders include the Dalai Lama, Oprah, and Barack Obama.

1ch79wo,UCSantaBarbara,What you should know before coming to UCSB,"1. The housing crisis: housing at this school truly is a lottery. If you submit everything on time for freshman year, it is pretty much *guaranteed* that you will get housing but no one likes to use that word here. After your first year, housing is a scramble. On-campus housing is definitely not guaranteed so you need to apply for apartments at the same time if you want to live on campus (in case you aren‚Äôt offered it). Apartments are also difficult to get, so most people start looking and applying around November/December. 

2. You don‚Äôt need to bring your car. Unless you have a job somewhere farther off campus, it is super easy to get by without a car. Parking on campus can also cost $500-700 per year. Everything within Isla Vista is walkable/bikeable, and there are a lot of buses that go from campus to downtown SB and marketplaces. The bus is free for UCSB students. If you are worried about visiting/going home, there is an Amtrak train 10 minutes from campus that going south all the way to San Diego, and buses that go to SLO. The SB airport is also 6 minutes from campus. 

3. Lectures and discussion sections: if you are a new student, registration might sound confusing. For me, it was. Lectures are basically the allotted classes that you attend and take notes in (you cannot choose the time you want, unless there are multiple options). For Discussion sections, there are usually 5 or 6 different times you can choose from, depending on the size of the class. These are usually an hour long and once a week. Contrary to popular belief, they are NOT optional unless your TA says so. Attendance at lecture and discussions are usually pretty strict, and a lot of professors incorporate attendance into your grade for the class. 

4. Party scene: usually there are parties happening every weekend, but you don‚Äôt always have to go. If you feel like you want to go to UCSB but aren‚Äôt interested in the party scene, it is still very easy to make friends who don‚Äôt party and don‚Äôt pressure you to. If you do want to party, it would be helpful to have a friend in greek life who can get you into more parties, because most of them require wristbands. 

5. Your bike will get stolen. It is a right of passage for it to happen, and this problem is ever-increasing. People will cut your lock, take your wheels, take the basket, seat, etc. So if you rely on a bike, DO NOT take an expensive one. 

6. Food is expensive!!!

Maintaining perspective while in the throes of crisis can be challenging, but if you have a setback, try to keep you wits about you and problem solve.

One problem-solving option available to first-year frosh and first-year transfer students is the retroactive grading option change. If you took a class for a letter grade and wound up earning a C- or below, you have the ability to go into GOLD at any time during winter quarter and change that letter grade to an NP.

1h1hvhd,UCSantaBarbara,"Ranking Barbers for male Asian Hair in IV, Goleta, Santa Barbara","Hi all,

At UCSB, I struggled to find a barber/hairstylist who could cut male Asian hair and searched for a while during my 4 years at UCSB. I always get a lot of questions about where I cut my hair and I thought I would share my unsolicited opinion on all of the barbers I saw and maybe help some folks who are going through a similar journey as me. For reference, I have stubborn, straight, coarse, thick, Asian hair that has no texture at all. I am aiming for a two block haircut that sort of resembles a under cut. My hair currently looks something like this [https://pin.it/6r8SJoa5A](https://pin.it/6r8SJoa5A) (although my skin is not that good lol)

But I also had this done as well at some of the locations [https://pin.it/qWciLmaHk](https://pin.it/qWciLmaHk)

I scoured these past Reddit threads for inspiration along my journey

Just so you know, I would go to ANY of these barbers for a haircut before an interview. This is just how I would rank them though:

1. Amanda at SportsClips ($), is hands-down the best barber I have had ever. To be specific, she did great work layering my hair, thinning the back so it doesn't look weirdly proportioned, and knew how to cut my hair so it fell in these really nice curtains that I haven't been able to find anywhere else. It also grew out really nicely, and since then I have been hooked. I haven't seen her fade though since I grew out my hair, but I am sure it is good since she just cuts men's hair.
2. Katherine at IV Hair Co. ($$$$), damn she does a good job but expensive. I went here before some big interviews to make sure it would be 100% good for sure
3. Mina at Richie's ($$), she gets an honorable mention for short Asian hair as her fades are insanely good
4. Juli at The Color Room ($$), I love the free side trims between appointments. Everything was pretty good, I appreciate her razor work and getting rid of the ""mushroom head"" that a lot of Asian dudes get
5. Iris at Studio One ($), she is great at all types of Asian hair, not just my two block from seeing her other happy clients and also from what I heard
6. Shay's at Richie's ($$), don't think they are at Richie's anymore though

I went to many other barbers but they aren't worth mentioning (in my opinion). I have stuck with Amanda for a while now, and she is not only the most affordable I have worked with but also the most experienced due to her amazing story and incredible background in working with Asian hair in her home country. She sees a lot of Asian UCSB students as her clientele, and a lot of people know her as she does graduation photos too.

Here are the rest of the barbers on my list that I was going to try if I haven't met Amanda:

* Palms Barbershop ($$), heard a lot of great things from here from my friends
* Anastacio at Atelier ($$$), for some reason people keep getting a wolf cut here, not sure why but heard it is good
* Goleta Barbers ($)
* Arturo's Barbershop and Hair Salon ($$)
* Isaac at Hair by Issac ($$)

Anyways, hope this helps! Let me know if there are any barbers I should try or that I missed!",-0.27,Social

No matter where I go‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs strolling down the street, crossing an intersection, or trying to peacefully exist‚ÄîI am *always* confronted by at least one, if not multiple, cars flaunting Sex Wax canisters from their rearview mirrors like some kind of cult emblem. Even when I walk around campus with my head down so as to not draw attention, I get suddenly whiplashed by the sight of a sex wax canister dangling from some hottie's backpack as they head to class. Is this thing a secret badge of honor? A pheromone-enhanced insignia that screams, *‚ÄúI am the apex predator of the college dating pool?‚Äù* How many metric units of sex is this college doing to necessitate this enormous stock of wax canisters? Are these cans actually essential survival gear in some kind of unspoken IV Hunger Games of hookups?

I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I need to get my mind off all this Sex Wax stuff. I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to take up surfing to forget about all of it. Maybe once I‚Äôm out there paddling into the waves with my own board, I can drown out all of my self-doubt with the sounds of the waves and put this sex wax stuff behind me. Wish me luck.

I like taking picture of things that are beautiful like birds and occasional sunset + the moon. In this place where everything is new but also a little overwhelming one of my best forms of escaping is through photography. I love when people say they like my photos but I also don't really do it for any recognition I just have a urge to capture beauty when I see it.

1co8hmp,UCSantaBarbara,A Poem About John Fom Sierra Properties,"

Where the shadows creep‚Ä¶

Lurks John, the lord of neglect, where grievances steep.

With a grin sly and cunning, a visage of deceit,

&amp;#x200B;

He pockets the pennies from the children seeking knowledge, we cry in defeat 

&amp;#x200B;

His buildings, they crumble, his promises hollow,

Yet John counts his coins in the gloom of his office, where none dare follow.

The leaky pipes sing a chorus of tenant's despair,

&amp;#x200B;

While John simply does not care.

The walls, dressed in mold, breathe a spore-laden sigh,

A testament to neglect that money can't deny.

Each room tells a story of silent, broken cries,

&amp;#x200B;

Where mold blooms in corners, unchecked by John, it multiplies.

&amp;#x200B;

He‚Äôs a ghost at the council, a whisper in the halls,

Ignoring the urgent, countless calls.

‚ÄúRepair and care,‚Äù they plead, in the damp ridden rooms,

&amp;#x200B;

But John‚Äôs heart is a vault that sympathy ne‚Äôer blooms.

&amp;#x200B;

He hoards every dollar, each dime he can wring,

From the pockets of babes, under ceilings decaying.

O John of Sierra, what tales your walls could tell,

&amp;#x200B;

Of greed over comfort, a personal hell.

&amp;#x200B;

May the whispers grow louder, till they're cries you can't ignore,

Save us from John at Sierra, the evil landlord.",-0.83,Other

4) 8th floor - 
 the most exciting floor to discover. the back room? the VIEW!!!  but with that comes the fact that it's extremely crowded. and it's too quiet for my liking. wish they had more of those sofas near the elevator! 




3) 1st floor- 
  Very crowded and lively during the day. gorgeous bathrooms. the diversity?? fun chairs at the front, giant blue booths, tables, couches, everything I could ask for. obviously not the place to go during peak hours, but I love an early morning, weekend, and late night on the first floor. 


2) fourth floor 
I would argue this floor has the worst work ethic for me. the hogwarts esque bookshelves should be motivating, but it for some reason isn't. gorgeous study rooms that I adore (especially on random weekends when they stay empty). the most charming floor 

1) seventh floor 
the absolute best floor. the aura is off the charts. large windows with an enchanting view of the mountains. the people on the seventh floor work hard, but they look happy and being here fills me with spirit. the tables are always clean and I like the chairs. best floor

1. Bus picks up a lot of people from sierra madre -&gt; ft -&gt; colegio rd. the closer you are to the campus the less likely you are to get on a bus in time during peak hours. 
2. Busses usually come within minutes of one another, and the same number bus cycles roughly every 20-30mins. Ex) if you missed bus 28 you‚Äôd wait about 18 mins to see it again at the same stop.
3. The 27 bus goes through IV therefore takes longer to get to campus.
4. Rainy days have more people than usual.
5. Busses can arrive early or late, a map app is your best guide for the estimated time 

Given a scenario: you live in ft and your class starts at 9:30am. The best way to guarantee you get to class on time is be at the bus stop around 9:00, because both busses 28 and 11 had just left at 08:52, and you‚Äôre very likely to get on the 27 bus at 09:08, or the next 28 bus at 09:10, or the 24 bus at 09:12. if you‚Äôre shit out of luck, a walk from ft to north hall is 30mins.

1deckbk,UCSantaBarbara,Serious Question,"I'm pro-Palestinian. I think what the Israeli government has done for decades, and especially right now, is terrible. From what I've seen, a lot of people agree with me on this. 

However, recently in this sub there has been a surge in support for police raids to shut down the encampment and arrest protesters. And in the abstract, this seems like an easy idea to support. Maybe you think the protests have gotten out of hand now that they are obstructing finals, and maybe you find the encampment obnoxious. And maybe you've thought to yourself that campus would be improved if these people were lawfully arrested. Police coming to arrest people being disruptive? Seems like the easiest call in the world. Easy and done with.

The reality is that a police raid would not go quietly and orderly. This would be a huge escalation in violence. People would get hurt. These kinds of decisions should not be treated with the kind of flippant levity that feels all too common in this sub. Students may get seriously injured, or even die. And over some tents near the library, and some finals being disrupted. Is it worth it? Police intervention should be treated as a last resort. Are we really at that point?

Last night the UCPD and SBSO, as well as some police from the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, arrived at 1am equipped with guns, riot gear, K-9 units, and armored vehicles to conduct a ""large-scale police operation."" Why did they do this? Why was the excessive equipment necessary? We don't really know, because after they cleared Girvetz they just stood around and held a perimeter for two and a half hours. Luckily no one got seriously hurt, but things could have gone south very quickly if even a couple people lost their cool. I think the overall level-headedness demonstrated by the protesters, despite attempts at agitation from counter protesters, is commendable. But this whole event brings the hypothetical violence of a police raid one step closer to reality, and that should worry us.

This unnecessary and excessive deployment of police has fractured my trust with the UCSB administration.

1fasslx,UCSantaBarbara,What do you wish that your professor knew?,"I'm a relatively seasoned professor in general, but new to UCSB. I think there are things about UCSB that are quite different from my previous institutions, so I'm trying to get a handle on that and how to best meet my students where they are here. So I have a few questions that I was hoping I could invade this space to ask.

I'll be teaching undergraduate courses in PSTAT, but I will appreciate comments from anyone. Here are my questions:

1. If I ask my students to bring laptops to class, will everyone be able to do that, or is this going to be an equity issue where not everyone will have one? If it's going to be an issue, are there any ways that I can mitigate it (e.g. resources on campus that I can point students to)?
2. If I ask students to respond verbally to questions during lecture, will I get crickets or will students actually do it? My previous experience is at schools in which my class sizes were at most 30 and often even less, so in-class interaction was a given there. Here, I'll be teaching classes with enrollments around 100-125 so I know it's a different beast, but I'm trying to figure out in what ways and by how much.
3. Is there a message board platform that students are accustomed to using for routine course content questions here at UCSB? Should I use Canvas for that, or is there something different/better?
4. Subject line. If I were your professor, what would you wish that I knew? Feel free to take this question in any direction that makes sense to you. But for example, at my previous institution, one feedback from a student was that they wished I wouldn't give my quizzes on Thursdays because Wednesday was pint night. That's the kind of insider information that I probably can't get from colleagues. Give me whatever you got.",-0.27,Academics

1d3we8d,UCSantaBarbara,The protesting shouldn‚Äôt go the way it has at other UCs,"In the last week protestors at Davis have begun barging into classes, even during exams and protestors at Santa Cruz blocked the roads in and out of their campus, leading people to wait for over 5 hours to leave campus and blocking first responders from entering. SC TAs have also gone on strike AFAIK.

Due to these actions, the public opinion on the protestors seems to have changed. There are a lot of posts on their respective subreddits condemning the protestors that get a lot of support in the comments as well. I don‚Äôt think this is a good thing for anyone involved. The students are disrupted and even put in danger, and the protestors lose support for their cause. 

So far, the protestors here at SB haven‚Äôt gone to these lengths. The worst I can recall from the past weeks was the library entrance. I think this is for the best, the students who want to be a part of the cause can join the group without being demonized and the students who don‚Äôt aren‚Äôt negatively impacted. But even without blocking the roads or barging into classrooms, we all know what the protestors here want. I think that is effective protesting.

But if we look back to the beginning of the protests here, we were following the other UCs. The events at Davis and Santa Cruz should be the line where we  stop following. Finals are approaching fast and many students are under a lot of stress. The last thing people need is ending up targets of protestors trying to ‚Äúdisrupt‚Äù.

I spoke to a few of them once and most of them came from the Midwest or somewhere random to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the students of Isla Vista. I have a friend who was heavily involved in their church for some time and he brought me to one of their Friday night worship services that was in the back of a house on DP, and they‚Äôd talk about the people of UCSB like they were evil and that hell is making its way into them because they go to parties. They‚Äôre so disconnected and uncultured.It‚Äôs such a dark way to view innocent kids hanging out with each other from class or after a sunset surf.

My lab partner and old housemate were living in their cars because there was nothing left. These people need to leave IV. They also refuse to speak to/hangout with UCSB students outside of their Friday burger night (where they stand on their platform and judge people walking by for partying and what they‚Äôre wearing), so they only hangout with each other when they say their only purpose is to be in the IV community. It is so toxic and disgusting, their hate for people that aren‚Äôt in their religion is disguised in selflessness.

1gsrzhl,UCSantaBarbara,some thoughts on career path from a TA,"I'm a TA, and I've received several students that have asked me about career paths post-graduation. I figured I'd write down some thoughts on a few things I think are underrated when it comes to finding a career. This is a long post and may not be relevant for many. 

What should you do with your life? While I don‚Äôt have definitive answers, I can offer a few heuristics. These aren‚Äôt prescriptions but rather thoughts I‚Äôve found useful for figuring out what actually matters.

Firstly, I think it‚Äôs underrated to consider the people you‚Äôll work with every day. It's obvious, but if you work a 9-to-5 and spend 5-10 pm with your family, you‚Äôre spending more time with your coworkers than your family. Your coworkers' personalities, values, and habits will influence you, for better or worse.

Are these people (in this field, this area of work) ones you‚Äôd want as friends? Do you genuinely enjoy being around them? Do your coworkers share your curiosity about the world? Do they care about solving the same types of problems you do? Do they approach challenges with a mindset you admire? Sometimes‚Äîand this is really unfortunate, but the truth‚Äîcompatibility comes down to factors like whether you feel welcome and accepted, especially if you're an outsider demographic to this field. Compatibility doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be the same, but if, after a couple of years, you still feel like an outsider‚Äîstruggling to connect‚Äîit might be a sign something‚Äôs off, either with this particular job, or perhaps with this entire field. At that point, you have to choose whether you can be the flag-bearing outsider (which is admittedly a more courageous but challenging path), or whether you should switch paths. 

Talk to 10 people working in Seattle's big tech, 10 in Silicon Valley's startup scene, and 10 on New York‚Äôs Wall Street, and you‚Äôll notice how different are the way they communicate, the topic of their conversation, and the content of their daily thoughts. You will become more and more like your coworkers. If the way they comport themselves irritates you, avoid them. So that‚Äôs the first heuristics: follow people you could be friends with.

Another way to make decisions less overwhelming is to work backward from where you want to end up. Who are the people you envy, the ones whose lives make you think, ""I wish I could do that""? Maybe it‚Äôs a scientist, an entrepreneur, or someone in your extended family whose life feels like a quiet success. Maybe it's someone that just seems extremely happy and content with their life. Trace their path. What degrees did they pursue? What early jobs and experiences shaped their trajectory? Did they regret any of those steps? This isn‚Äôt a perfect strategy, of course‚Äîthe world changes, and paths that worked in the past may not work now. But we often ignore this simple approach. One example I‚Äôm always amazed by is how FDR rose to political prominence by mirroring the trajectory of his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Both began in New York politics, served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, became Governor of New York, and eventually president. So, once you‚Äôve decided on an end goal, doggedly pursue it by imitating people that have already achieved that goal. 

In imitating people, one of the best ways to learn about these paths is to talk to people. LinkedIn isn‚Äôt just for recruiters‚Äîit‚Äôs for you. Cold message someone whose career you admire and ask if they‚Äôd be willing to chat. Most people are generous when it comes to sharing their stories, especially if you approach them with genuine curiosity as a younger professional. Asking for a 15-minute conversation can shift your perspective.

Risk analysis is also an important method for thinking about your career. Charlie Munger had a morbid but useful saying: ""All I want to know is where I‚Äôm going to die so I‚Äôll never go there."" Applied to careers, this is incredibly practical. Figure out the most likely ways your career could go wrong, and then avoid those scenarios like the plague. If you‚Äôre prone to depression, moving to a dreary town with no sunlight could be terrible. If you‚Äôre prone to alcoholism, and your job requires regular dining and happy hours, that could be a problem. I'm not saying it has to be a problem, but you should at least be aware of the problem. You don‚Äôt need perfect foresight, but you should take time to write down potential pitfalls.

Besides looking out for pitfalls, you should consider the outcome distribution. Some careers offer predictable outcomes. Becoming an accountant comes with a fairly tight band of expected salaries and job stability. This can be great‚Äîor terrible! If you‚Äôre used to working hard and seeing rewards, it can be disconcerting when you‚Äôre not recognized for your work. Careers where there‚Äôs a clear link between your contribution and the end result often offer greater rewards for high achievers. Other careers are wildly different. They have ""right-tailed distributions,"" where a tiny fraction of people reap enormous rewards. Think about actors, musicians, or entrepreneurs. In these fields, the median outcome might be modest‚Äîor even dismal‚Äîbut top performers become household names.

How do you feel about chasing long odds? If you consistently outperform, maybe you should aim for a right-tailed field. But know the stakes: there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll land near the middle, and you have to be okay with that. Most baseball players never make it to the major leagues. Most academics don‚Äôt land tenure-track jobs at Harvard. Most musicians don‚Äôt get a million listens. But these paths aren‚Äôt failures. Many people in these fields live deeply fulfilling lives because they love the work, regardless of where they land. Some fields heavily reward exceptional talent, while others don‚Äôt differentiate much between the great and the good. Choose accordingly. Are you content with the process‚Äîthe grind, the craft, the relationships‚Äîand find it meaningful enough even if you don‚Äôt hit the jackpot?

You should try your best to work on big problems that excite you. It is generally the case that a stupid person with obsession can achieve greater things than an genius that doesn't obsess. Think of it like playing videogames. I guarantee you the most intelligent person on the planet, if forced to play a videogame that the least intelligent person on the planet has been playing for 20 years, would lose. In fact, they would lose repeatedly. It's like those studies that find that the best indicator for how good you are at chess is actually just the amount of time you've spent playing and studying chess. Same here--deliberate practice matters, but your skill at a certain field will depend on the amount of obsession and time you put into it. Obsession will lead to finding a group of like-minded people, which leads to more deliberate practice. Begin with trying to solve problems that you can obsess over. 

Luck plays an outsized role in many careers, but luck isn‚Äôt purely random. You can increase your odds by putting yourself in environments where opportunities are more likely to emerge. Surround yourself with ambitious, curious, and motivated people. If you‚Äôre around people who constantly tinker with new ideas or pursue interesting projects, some of that energy will rub off on you. Geography matters for luck. Certain cities or industries concentrate talent and ideas, accelerating serendipity. Breaking into film? LA is better than a random suburb. Want to work in tech? The Bay Area has its perks.

Finally, your personal life. The timing and trajectory of your income can shape family plans in ways you might overlook. Careers with delayed financial rewards, like medicine, might cause you to delay starting a family. Careers with steep early salaries like banking might offer more financial flexibility in your 20s but sacrifice work-life balance. Think about when you want certain milestones‚Äîkids, a house, financial independence‚Äîand how your career aligns with those goals. Money isn‚Äôt everything, but it determines when you can afford stability, and stability matters when building a life with others.

The heuristics I‚Äôve outlined are just tools to help you reflect. When in doubt, seek advice from those who‚Äôve walked the path before you, try the job out (get an internship or even just take the job and quit after one year!), and remain open to life‚Äôs serendipity.",-0.23,Career

1dpyeys,UCSantaBarbara,"Palestine Protestors, Who really were they?","Sitting in one of the campus buildings after the whole encampment was taken down, I noticed a person with quite eccentric clothing going about their business. I struck up a conversation with them. They talked about how their computer charger got thrown away during the clean-up. Out of curiosity, I asked, ""What graduate program are you in?"" They replied that they were a local activist who never attended UCSB.

This perplexed me. Their passion for the cause was very apparent. They were definitely not happy about the outcome of the University's actions. I mentioned how I heard that divestment occurred. They dodged the statement by stating their distaste for the English language and how they were not present during the negotiations. 

My only question is, who were these protestors? I know there were separate groups. I know a decent population of SJP (Undergrads, Grads, and potentially Professors). Good for them (I see nothing wrong with most of their actions). However, that is different for the rest of the population. How many of these protestors had no affiliation with the University besides proximity? That is my question. Who were the people sleeping in the encampments in protest? Were they students? If so, how many students, grad students, and other members affiliated with the University stayed out all night in protest, writing their message all over campus? In all honesty, how many of them were unaffiliated to the University? From what that person told me and from what I understood, a decent number of the present protestors never had any actual affiliation.",-0.33,Politics

1d7nvrl,UCSantaBarbara,(Rant lol) does anyone else feel like this?,"I've been wanting to post on this subreddit for a while and, in light of recent events, I feel that this is probably the best time to do so.

Just to preface this: I would like to say that this will be quite long and specific to my personal experience here at UCSB. I know some will not relate to this at all and I'm sure lots of people have had positive experiences (which is great! that's the experience I envy). To be honest, I'm not trying to shit on the school but I'm just really disappointed since I was expecting a lot more from such a prestigious college. Hopefully some of you will be able to relate so none of us will feel alone. Anyways, I'm basically saying just take my rant with a grain of salt. 

I attended UCSB for all 4 years and have recently graduated just last quarter (Winter 2024) with a BS in Actuarial Science. My first year was all online due to COVID so I've really only been in SB for 3 years.

The Actuarial Science major is under the Probability and Statistics (PSTAT) Department so 90% of my classes were PSTAT classes. I honestly feel that the PSTAT department is extremely lackluster and definitely not what I was expecting at all going to a UC. The turnover rate for professors in the department is absolutely insane, with lecturers both coming in and leaving nearly every year. Some only stay for a year or two, and it's always the good ones that leave. I struggled a lot in some of my classes because the material can get pretty difficult, which is understandable and to be expected. However, I was not expecting like 75% of the instructors to be awful lecturers and apathetic to the students in their class. It really didn't encourage me to want to go to office hours to interact with them and ask questions if they were just going to spit something condescending back at me.  
  
I don't know, I guess I just can't believe I was paying my tuition just to have someone read off of the textbook every single lecture, never provide practice problems or give non-textbook examples, and be barely responsive to emails (which one professor did for the 2 classes I took with him).  
  
My last quarter here was especially frustrating because one of the classes I was taking (that I needed to graduate) honestly felt like a joke. We had 3 quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 final exam, as well as 1 final project. Nothing was ever graded and I felt like all the work I was doing on the exams/quizzes/project was all for nothing. Was there a point in even trying if the professor was going to randomly assign As and Bs anyways? Not to mention that I didn't receive my final grade until nearly 2 weeks after the deadline for instructors to upload grades had passed. Overall, I just feel like I didn't really learn a lot, let alone have a good time while doing so. It also definitely made my imposter syndrome worse as I (still) feel like I don't really deserve my diploma.

In case you couldn't tell, I got really depressed during my junior year because of this and ended up turning to CAPs for therapy. On a much more positive note, I really liked my therapist and eventually broke out of my depressive/anxious state, so I do have UCSB to thank (?) for that. However, my sessions made me slowly realize how much UCSB was quite literally draining me. I felt a lot of guilt because my parents were paying my tuition just for me to not have a good time. 

Other positive things: UCSB did help me secure a full-time job and I met my s/o here, both of which I'm extremely grateful for. I guess just looking back at everything, I want to be able to say I had a good time because it's college (supposedly the best years of my life). However, I feel like there are so many negatives that I just can't ignore and pretend like they didn't affect me at all. I just wonder if anyone has had a similar experience as me.

I do find it funny that even after graduating, UCSB still continues to fuck me over. They couldn't even just let me have the commencement that I want :/ Changing things last minute less than 2 weeks before graduation is absolutely foul.

If you made it to the end, thanks for reading all of it lol I really appreciate it :\]

TLDR: PSTAT department really sucks lol. major imposter syndrome. overall, just really not the experience I was expecting. some positives but they don't really outweigh the negatives.",-0.73,Academics

1diybki,UCSantaBarbara,Commencement 2024,"I am making this post to hear the thoughts of other graduates and people who have gotten to see other UC and even non-UC commencement ceremonies.

I'm a transfer student who was only at UCSB for 2 years, but the entire experience was extremely expensive for me as I received almost no financial aid. Needless to say, I'm disappointed by how terrible lots of the commencement ceremonies went. Mine was the 9am letters of science, and I honestly regret going. 

Whoever's idea it was to use some generic AI voice instead of actually hiring someone to acknowledge students needs to be reevaluared. I feel so bad for the students who's name glitched out and didn't get read so they just did a walk of shame. I've been to several graduations at many different college systems and at 90% of the other schools, your actual degree and honor status are actually read out by someone. I've also never seen a ceremony with such bad flow. There was long periods of terribly awkward silence and the whole thing felt cheap and badly organized.

Maybe I was spoiled by my community College, but I very much expected the diploma cover and handshake format, and some sort of umbrellas or cover for the venue because I almost passed out of heatstroke. The worst part of the ceremony by far was the lack of water for graduates and the families standing out in a 2 mile line in the sun. 

There was so much more of a focus placed on the Chancellor and his Coleague that won an award in comparison to the students that it almost felt malicious. Also, I personally thought the student speaker was funny, but you could see the concern and disdain of the faculty in the background at his words and it was kind of unnerving. 

I also had a newborn sibling attend, and my parents informed me after the ceremony that they didn't get to sit next to eachother because of a lack of stroller and ramp access for guests. 

I am still awaiting the email regarding the photos, so I'm not sure when we are supposed to get those.

All in all, I thought it felt extremely transactional and instead of making me excited, it left a bad taste in my mouth. For as hard as we all worked, it felt like a final ""f you!"" From the university on our way out. I'm curious to see how others felt.",-0.83,Politics

1h51gvv,UCSantaBarbara,"Post Thanksgiving Blues, W's, and Retroactive NPs","For many students, the bluest time of the year is the stretch between the end of Thanksgiving and the start of winter break. It's a cold, dark, period riddled with academic potholes. Yuck. 

But you still gotta grind. 

For the uninitiated, however, there are some options UCSB has in place that can ease some students' worries. To wit:

\- Changing an optional-graded course to P/NP (Friday 12/6 is the deadline; you can make the change yourself in GOLD)

\- Dropping a course for academic reasons (12/6 is also the deadline for this, too). Not every student's case is the same, but if you're unsure if you can late-drop a course (which would result in a W), contact [L&amp;S advising](https://www.duels.ucsb.edu/advising/general-academic-advising) and explore your options.   

\- First year frosh and transfers also have the option to *retroactively* change from a C- and below to an NP for courses that are grading optional. For ex: you need that B- on your final to earn a C for the course but you got a bad case of the yips and tanked it, earning a D+ for the class. Go into GOLD ***before winter quarter ends (that's right--you have the whole next quarter to do so)*** and change it to an NP. Instant GPA boost! (and if you were a first-year student last spring and have been meaning to change that C- or below to NP...you have until 12/13/24 to do so)

\- Speaking of tanking finals: As a general matter I['m very much against](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GjDqr6yO9wtkucKRSMoZ6BfTkDicYb6mloJ2jaDenVs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z3k6r5wmzhdq) the ""deliberately failing an exam so I can have the pleasure of repeating the course next term."" I mean, I get it (thanks for nothing, Econ 10A), but that's some serious mental gymnastics right there. Try real hard not to do that if you can avoid it. 

Good luck all. Sometimes we have to remind ourselves: the only way out is through.

1cqkrqc,UCSantaBarbara,why is the intro bio series like this,"basically what the title says but i have had two professors now (finkelstein and thomasson) who are legitimately horrible teachers. this is not a ‚Äúi‚Äôm a bad student‚Äù or an ‚Äúi‚Äôm lazy and don‚Äôt want to study‚Äù complaint, but a genuine plea by a dedicated and passionate student to take these professors OUT of the intro bio series. i have had some actually fantastic professors in this series (latto, feinstein) and i know the school can supply more of them to make the intro bio series more inspiring than discouraging. my gripes with the two professors i‚Äôve mentioned is how painfully disorganized they are. for teaching classes of hundreds of students, they should be able to order a slide deck properly, actually know how to answer questions when asked, and provide thorough explanations. 

my experience with finkelstein was her getting her own test questions wrong and being unable to explain why, and giving us the most difficult final i have ever laid my eyes on. she would laugh at students questions to their face in front of a lecture hall and not explain her slides, and she fully killed any love i ever had for plants. she is clearly a smart woman, but i really question why she was tasked to teach INTRO bio. 

and i have thomasson now, so I can‚Äôt speak to her tests but so far we have been watching her on ZOOM. she is self-proclaimed ‚Äúnot a plant expert‚Äù (teaching us about plants) and it‚Äôs becoming clear with the comments she makes that she doesn‚Äôt write her own slides. she‚Äôs also disorganized, doesn‚Äôt use a pointer on her picture-heavy slides, and repeatedly says completely incorrect information that she contradicts later. 

this is a long rant but i am so frustrated, as a bio major i want to feel excited about my major like many of my professors have made me, not upset and discouraged. we are a uc and should be able to provide quality lecturers, and its apparent that student reviews at the end of the quarter and on rate my professor are completely ignored. 

edit: i would also like to add that i‚Äôve gotten A‚Äôs in all intro bio courses so i‚Äôm making it work and i‚Äôm not complaining about my grades, but i should feel like im struggling with the material NOT with how the professor is teaching it.",-0.83,Academics

Please take care to validate that anyone trying to sell tickets is a real UCSB student with real tickets to offer. Tips:

* From /u/jtp6172: ""Everyone, use PayPal goods and services. If they are reluctant to use this it's probably a scam. PayPal G&amp;S is the only way to send money with buyer protection.""
* Ask them to email you from their UCSB email address (this helps but is not a guarantee that they're real).
* Ask for proof that they have tickets to sell.
* Check their comment history to see if they've posted here before about normal things.
* Photos of ID cards aren't good enough. They can be stolen or faked.

1g5l9ye,UCSantaBarbara,Mean professor and TA. Advice needed,"(using a throwaway)

Hello I won‚Äôt be naming any names but I need some advice. Right now I am taking an American Politics class (won‚Äôt be naming the professor but to those who take Poli Sci this might be obv) and I am really struggling. To preface I‚Äôm an international student and this is my first time living in America and learning anything about American politics. Not using it as an excuse but I am still figuring out how the systems work here so I feel very  behind already in my class full of mostly American students who have taken APUSH or learnt about American history in high school. My professor had multiple bad reviews (1 * on ratemyprofessor)  but I still took the class because I need it to graduate on time. But now I truly regret it he is exactly what everyone said he was like, he is condescending and rude. And at first I was alright with it thinking things will be fine because my TA would be better. Wrong, my TA is not any better. He has started to target me in class as I don‚Äôt answer, which is fine because I know he wants me to engage but I am still learning the basics and he has grown to dislike me because I don‚Äôt know the answers to the questions he asks me. I try very hard and I never miss class but English is not my first language and it‚Äôs hard to keep up. A few days ago in section I was determined to participate in class so when my TA put up some questions I started to google what some words meant and put it in a translator so that I could hopefully answer. He picked on me to answer before I could translate what the question was specifically asking for and then yelled at me for being on my phone. I didn‚Äôt even have the chance to explain that I was just researching the question. I usually write down topics or words I don‚Äôt understand on my phone and go home and learn them but now I‚Äôm even too scared to do that. With my midterms coming up I feel defeated in performing well in this class. I‚Äôve never done bad in a class and need to do well to keep my GPA requirement. Does anyone know anything I can do or anyone I can talk to, to get help or maybe report this behavior. 



TLDR : Professor and TA are in-accommodating and I‚Äôm looking for someone I can go to for help with my class or to report this behavior.",-0.83,Mental Health

1gyml9v,UCSantaBarbara,Thoughts on UCSB Athletics,"As someone who's gone to every single men's and women's basketball game so far this season, and the last handful of men's and women's soccer games and the attendance is pretty low. Men's basketball usually has the best turn out, and I get people, in general, prefer to watch men's sports more since they think it's more competitive, but our sports teams are pretty damn good. I'm not even talking about the general public's attendance, because that is harder to control, but the student sections are always so empty. The men's soccer team only had high attendance numbers for the Cal Poly game, and the playoffs, same with the women's. The men's basketball team as I said has had consistent outings from the student section, but the women's team has hardly anyone showing out to games, even for their home opener. 

I feel like us not having a football team hurts the sports life at UCSB, but our sports teams are consistently a powerhouse in the Big West conference and are consistently good enough to make the NCAA tournament (Our men's and women's soccer teams just made it to the tournament, in fact, the men play today in the 2nd round).

Some may not even realize it--perhaps they've been dropped from fall classes unbeknownst to them, only to learn belatedly that they're over the proverbial barrel.

If you're jammed up, *there is no need to wait until the start of the school year* to address your scheduling problems. [Advisors in the College of Letters &amp; Science](https://duels.ucsb.edu/advising) can help. Our [qless line](https://queues.ucsb.edu/) opens today at 9:30. I can assure you the line will be much shorter this week and early next week than it will be on Sep 26.

There are limits to what we can do (we can't place you into over-subscribed classes or move you further up a class waitlist, for example), but we can certainly explore options and help you troubleshoot. You can also try contacting instructors by searching for them in the [UCSB directory](https://www.ucsb.edu/directory), though they may be busy putting finishing touches on syllabi, etc.

Department advisors are also great resources for students, too. If you don't know how to track them down, Googling ""UCSB ### Department advising"" usually does the trick (seems elementary, but I'm surprised at how often I have to show this ""hack"" to students). They can give you the skinny on add codes, department crash policies, etc.

1hdkcsi,UCSantaBarbara,How I got an A- in 10A,"So final grades just came out for Econ 10A and I passed with an A- so I wanted to give some tips to other students who plan on taking it later. As a heads up about me, I‚Äôm a third year transfer student so maybe my experience with the class might be different but nonetheless I think some advice could help. 

First off, the most important thing to keep in mind with this class is staying on top of the material that you learn from day 1 to the final lecture. This class in particular goes over an extensive amount of material in just 10 weeks so make sure everything is fresh in your mind especially when the final comes around. And this is not as bad as it sounds as most of the material builds off each other. Only around post midterm 2 does stuff get a little different. 

Secondly, the past exams are your best friend. People really aren‚Äôt lying when they say spam practice tests over and over again. People do say things like the smart work and problem sets aren‚Äôt that helpful and while I can somewhat agree with that, it‚Äôs still more practice which can never hurt when it comes to a class like this. 

Thirdly, I don‚Äôt care how confident you feel about the material, GO TO CLAS AND DROP INS. You‚Äôd be surprised how empty they are, so take advantage of that time do get more help. 

That‚Äôs about it, I could go more into detail but if you‚Äôre reading this, you already know you‚Äôll have to study a lot. With that being said, don‚Äôt feel discouraged especially after reading about bad experiences, it is a hard class but it‚Äôs not impossible, I can‚Äôt tell you how nervous I was over the entire summer for this class and it turned out fine for me and I‚Äôm not a Econ or math genius in any way.

The menu through their portal list my burger at a starting price of $21, 23.50 with the adds. Makes sense.

1ei17pa,UCSantaBarbara,Econ/Finance Internship Guide,"Hi everyone, I'm writing this because I'm bored and I wish I would have had it when I was a freshman since UCSB's career prep outside of accounting is terrible. Just a little background on me: 

I am a rising senior who has had finance internships all three summers of college. My most recent internship (still ongoing actually) is at one of the largest US banks. I am an economics major with an art minor and my GPA is above 3.5 but it's not anything crazy. I am the treasurer of two different clubs. I am not part of any business related club on campus either.

\*\*THIS IS NOT FOR ACCOUNTING! THIS IS A BIG 4 TARGET SCHOOL, SO NO DETAILED GUIDE NEEDED.

  
For incoming freshman:

* Do not stress too much, but do start drafting a resume using the Mergers and Inquisitions format (very standard).
* Go to a career fair just to get an idea of the types of companies that go directly to UCSB to recruit. There will usually be no banks, but always best to at least look at the lineup on Handshake.
* Start applying to some internships during Winter break if you have time, if not then use some free time during winter/spring quarter to apply.
   * WARNING: Most places do not want to hire freshman interns, but you only need one job offer to immediately get experience. EXPERIENCE IS KEY! It is not necessary that you have an internship during freshman summer, but it will be very useful in securing a more prestigious sophomore summer internship.
* Get a blazer and a nice shirt for interviews. Always better to be overdressed than underdressed. Almost all of my interviews have been on Zoom, so you don't need to buy slacks or anything yet. Also, I think the career center might let you borrow interview clothes? Don't quote me on that though.
* Always accept every interview (except Northwestern Mutual, that place is a scam), at least to practice your communication skills. Interviewing is a very important skill that is hard to build, so practice whenever you are given the opportunity.
* If you get an offer for freshman summer, great! If not, it's not a big deal at all. Just make sure you do something mildly productive during summer though, like working a part-time job or volunteering.

For incoming sophomores:

* Getting an internship this summer is very important for working up to a more prestigious internship the next summer. I recommend focusing on a specific industry within finance/business, and expanding outside of that once you have exhausted your options.
* LOOK AT FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS! Many large banks will have fellowship programs for specific groups of students, usually for people of color. If you can get your foot in the door this way, you have an expedited path to a great internship the next summer. I did not get one of these fellowships, however I think they are a great option if they apply to you.
* Still continue interviewing a lot. More companies will be willing to hire you now, therefore you will get more practice.
* Continue attended career fairs, you never know what opportunities may come from them. 
* Use LinkedIn and Handshake to apply to jobs. I primarily used LinkedIn for my internship applications, but Handshake is also great (it has limited options though). Also utilize specific company websites for larger banks.
   * NOTE: Larger banks start their application cycles much earlier than other firms, so be wary of due dates. Start looking in August/September.
* Make sure your GPA is above a 3.5. Many of your hardest classes will be this year, so take some easy GEs to balance out bad grades. If you have time, take a language every quarter to build that skill and also get a pretty easy, 5 unit A.
* Hopefully you are able to secure an internship for this summer. UCSB is a good school and you are likely a driven individual. No, you don't need an internship for sophomore summer, however I do think it is important to get some experience before your junior summer.

For incoming juniors:

* It is time to get serious. This internship has the opportunity to give you a full-time return offer for after graduation, setting your early adult life up for success. And who doesn't want to have a stress free senior year? Hopefully you have at least one internship's worth of experience to learn back on, but it still isn't the end of the world if not. You will likely have to apply to more jobs though.
* Really hone in on specific parts of finance/business that you are interested in. Be able to tell a story or give an explanation as to why you are interested in it during an interview. Bonus points if your last internship was in the same field.
* Focus your efforts on large banks first. They might start hiring as early as the before your sophomore summer internship, which is crazy. (If so, you are allowed to still put your upcoming internship on your resume with a basic job description and the dates you will be working.) These will be the most prestigious, competitive, and high-paying jobs. Even if you get one of these internships but don't get a return offer, you still get to have a powerful brand name on your resume.
* If you do not get an offer from a large bank, look at regional banks and other smaller firms. Often times you will get a more personalized, mentor-style experience at these jobs which can be more beneficial than being filtered through an automated system. These jobs are still amazing despite a less powerful name brand.
* I'm not gonna lie, it is pretty important that you get an internship this summer. Entry level jobs now still expect some level of experience, so having something on your resume is key. Still not the end of the world, but it will set you up for more success.
* If you are interviewing at multiple places, use the other interviews/offers as leverage. You might be able to speed up the interview process or offer process if you say you need to decide on a certain offer soon. It will also make you look like a more desirable candidate.

Interview Tips:

* EVERY JOB IS YOUR DREAM JOB! Even if you are interviewing for something you aren't that interested in, you better act like its the best job you could ever imagine. You are always better off leveraging more job offers than ending up with none.
* Write down the CEO and any key leaders of the company, along with being able to point out things on the job description that interest you.
* Interviews should flow more like a conversation than a Q&amp;A. This will allow you to show off more of your personality. People don't want to just hire a set of skills, they want a good human being as well.
* Read a recent finance article before your interviews and be able to touch on why you thought it was interesting. ""Tell me about something you read recently"" is a very common interview question, so be prepared and sound intelligent.
* Leverage past internships/jobs in the stories you tell. Highlight the skills you built in every question. Your internship experiences are a million times more important than what you did in school.
* Make sure you have good wifi, sound, video, a clean/blurred background, and a quiet space. Tell your roommates to go away or book a room in the lib. Professionalism is extremely important.
* Join the zoom at least 5 minutes before it starts.
* Avoid filler words (ex. um, like). They make you sound immature. This is a habit I'm still working on breaking since it's so prevalent with students.
* Always send a follow-up thank you email to the people who interviewed you. Also connect with them on LinkedIn. Also include the HR person if they were your point of contact.

General Internship Tips: 

* Be early and stay late all the time. Looks matter a lot, even if people say they don't.
* Be overdressed, unless specifically told not to do so. You will never look unprepared when you're overdressed.
* Set up weekly meetings with your manager as a way to check your progress and make sure you're on track for success. This is most applicable to the junior summer internship so you can see if you're on track for a return offer.
* Make friends with a lot of people in the office. There should be a lot of people who are willing to advocate for your personality, work quality, and work ethic.
* Even if you don't like someone, pretend you do. Pretending to like someone for 10 weeks is annoying, but not the end of the world.
* Don't cry at work. It makes you look immature. If you get bad feedback or are having trouble with something, just keep working at it. It will make you look better in the long run.
* Be known as a positive presence in the office. People love when interns come, so play into that. Old people love it.

Okay, hopefully this was helpful. I kind of just info dumped everything from my head. Feel free to ask questions if you want and I'll try to answer them. Also feel free to add any different perspectives or advice. I don't want to give specifics away for where I've worked, what clubs I'm in, or anything personal though for safety reasons. I know there's a lot here, but hopefully it will help people be more successful with their experience at UCSB.

Thanks!",-0.14,Finance
1e60hhw,UCSantaBarbara,Study spots on campus outside of the library,"I've compiled a list of my favorite study spots on campus in all my years in undergrad. Here it goes:

1. The lounges in SSMS: super comfortable chairs, outlets, quiet, and a nice view of storkie
2. Phelps 6300s: Great Goleta pier view, only one desk on highest floor and beware the balcony locks you out. Also elevator #2 is usually broken. The prof lounge is right next to it though, so it's not awesome being in the walkway sometimes.
3. 4th floor HSSB: Great view of depressions--you can see the ocean waves crash on the beach. There's one desk with two chairs and two outlets. Bathroom is private with a window too which is nice.
4. Bren Hall balcony: it's best outside in the evening when there's less direct sun, but there are sunshades. There's also outlets outside if you flip up the gray plastic covers by the plants. The bathroom is great too. There's outdoor whiteboards nearby as well
5. 6th floor Broida balcony: Goleta Pier view with an outlet outside and a chalk board. The right elevator going up is also super cool as it has physics trinkets inside. Beware though I caught a bug in my code and then a bug landed on my laptop

I'll be moving down to to start my PhD at UCSB this fall. 

I'm really excited about it on all fronts: the department is a great fit, my likely advisor is a really cool dude, and I'm going to get paid to do exactly what I most want to do with my time (read, write, and argue). I'm also pretty outdoorsy--or sporty, maybe?--and a Californian through and through, so the natural environment is a big plus. 

Importantly, however, I'm staunchly anti-car (or at least personal motorized vehicle ownership). I haven't owned one in almost 10 years now and don't want to get one. 

I've also made it work in some places that people take to be those where one ""needs"" a car. To the point, I lived in LA for 6 years without a car. 

Anyway, I'm looking for advice and thoughts about living without a car in Goleta, SB proper, etc. I'll be in grad student housing for at least the 1st year, so it won't be an issue there. After my first two years, I also won't need to be on-campus *that* much.

I'm an incoming freshman for UCSB as a pre-comm major in fall 2024. I loved the campus and the people when I went to the Open House but the fees are extremely expensive... I'm an international student and I need to pay Out-Of-State which is 78k plus the housing fees is more than 80k... I'm a child of a single mother and her annual income is not even close to 100k. When I submitted my FAFSA my school only gave me 14k which is not enough and that's why I'm opting applying to a lot of scholarships but I haven't heard any news about them. I don't know what to do, I really don't want to take a gap year or community college... The only option I have is going into a huge student debt and paying it while working and studying.



EDIT: I was born in California and moved to Mexico as soon as I was born. I applied to 9 universities in total, and all of them rejected me except for UCSB. I finished all my studies in Mexico, but I don't like the education here, which is why I only applied to US universities.",-0.73,Finance

1dim6d7,UCSantaBarbara,Alumni Crisis,"Hey guys,

I'm actually an alumni who graduated in 2020 with a major in Philosophy (Ethics/Public policy concentration) and earned my TMP certificate. As a first gen college student I had absolutely zero clue how to navigate the university system and effectively utilize my resources, nor did I have any idea what I wanted to do with my life. Unfortunately, I did not take my time at UCSB serious enough and struggled with substance abuse and depression and partied more than I should have. Consequently, I did end up graduating (somehow) but with an abysmal gpa of 2.4. 

Since graduating, I've been working government finance for the past 3 years, mostly in an administrative capacity. It's an OK gig but I'm getting bored and really want further my academic career. However, I feel like I have little to no chance of getting accepted to any master's program or law school with my gpa. 

  
I guess the point of my post is this: has anyone been in a similar situation as me, but overcame the gpa obstacle and went on to successfully get into a master's or JD program? Would it even be worth it to pursue an MA or JD or would it be better to go for professional certifications? Would love to hear from someone who has been through a similar experience.

Hopefully, this helps future students down the line, since I know questions about how to pass 10a often surface every quarter or so.

**1. Old Midterms:**  
Seriously, the most important thing you can do is work through as many old midterms as possible. Not just a few‚Äîaim for at least 15. Yes, it sounds like a lot, but you‚Äôll see patterns and even old questions pop up again. Prioritize recent ones, but don‚Äôt ignore older exams either. I saw questions from as far back as 2016 on my tests.

**2. CLAS Tutoring:**  
I didn‚Äôt try the drop-in hours, but I heard they‚Äôre good. I did attend the weekly scheduled tutoring sessions at the start of the quarter and found them really helpful. If you can make the time, go‚Äîespecially early on.

**3. What‚Äôs Useless:**  
Problem sets, sections, lectures, the textbook, SmartWork, and the official review sessions weren‚Äôt just unhelpful, they were misleading. Don‚Äôt rely on these to guide you toward what will show up on exams‚Äîthey never matched up for me.

In the end, just take notes of the lecture slides on your own, try your best to understand them, and grind out as many previous exams as you possibly can, if not all of them... multiple times. Good Luck.",-0.33,Academics

I know that most people would just tell me its normal to have doubts like this as a first year and that I just need to adjust and give it time but in my gut I just know that its not right. I don't see myself living here for the next 3 years and I *know* I would be more happy back home at community or a csu like I initially planned. 



I was admitted off the waitlist and with my financial aid it was a ridiculous opportunity to turn down, and now I feel like the decision was somewhat impulsive. the school in itself is great--the academics are fine, the beach is pretty--but I still just don't feel right here, and I don't think I could ever call iv or sb home for that matter.

it also sucks that with the credits I came in with i'm on track to graduate in 3 years, and that's with two minors planned out too. so I feel like transferring would be a loss of the progress I have here and if I wait any longer there would be no point. if I do transfer im adding back the usual 4th year regardless because of the need to take ges or major requirements that are different at other universities.

Also if there's like any questions or things like that I'm more than happy to answer or give advice!

Some general tips:
I cannot stress this enough - MAKE SURE YOUR FOUNDATIONS ARE GOOD!!!! Undergrad was low-key a breeze JUST BECAUSE I spent extra time at the beginnings and made sure I didn't have any unanswered questions. You will thank yourself 100x over and be cracked if you take your time and leave nothing unsure.


I'd recommend buying a cheap laptop and instead buying a PC tower if you want something for gaming or stuff, otherwise just a light laptop with good battery is all you need.


Don't just latch onto the first friend group you find, take each class as an opportunity to meet new people. Your friends are never the ones you really expect I find, so keep an open mind. For making friends it's this easy:
1. Hey, my name's ----! Are you down to be study buddies?
2. Do you wanna exchange numbers / discord 
3. Work together and suffer and trauma bond


Make use of your office hours! Sometimes professors can be scary but TAs love to help out people who want to learn.

While it's still a *very* competitive path, I would also argue it also has the lowest barrier to entry--and one of the speediest ROI--in the health professions. 

Last month, [I contacted a number of Gaucho alumni](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GjDqr6yO9wtkucKRSMoZ6BfTkDicYb6mloJ2jaDenVs/edit?usp=sharing) who are at different stages in their nursing profession journeys and asked if they'd be willing to share their insights.

He will be greatly missed, which is probably all any of us could hope for in the short amount of time we have to mark our lives. 

If you had one of his classes it is likely that he was one of your favorite professors. The extra effort he put in, making sure that everyone had a chance to thrive, had to touch your heart. 

He liked to teach by telling stories. Cleverly slipping in the information you would need to accomplish your assignments. This didn‚Äôt necessarily make the subject easy, but at least it was pleasant. 

He was also a fan of the arts, regularly attending the student concerts. He was himself a musician having played in his school‚Äôs orchestra. He often had comments about the shows that illustrated deep understanding of the performance. 

UC will be greatly diminished now that he is gone. Maybe the school can do something to honor the massive positive impact he had on this place. He probably would have enjoyed the recital hall named after him. It would after all be a great way to celebrate his contribution to our community, and let the music that was his life play on.",-0.03,Mental Health

1fgt0gg,UCSC,Be safe y‚Äôall: Short message about drugs,"Hey! Old fart alumnus here. A new school year is starting, I see posts here from lots of new students starting their first year at UCSC.

I don't know how much info is circulated to you guys and gals and non-binary pals, but I wanted to post a brief message.

Short version: Fentanyl is increasingly found in all kinds of gray and black market drugs. Even if it's not supposed to be an opiate type drug. So like, even in MDMA/ecstasy, or knock-off copies of ADHD type meds.

I am not condoning the use of illegal drugs, but I know that realistically they are a part of many people's college experience. I know from my past experience that even people who never thought they'd try any, may find themselves trying them at some point through friends etc.

So here are a couple resources for harm reduction that you may not be aware of:
Dance Safe provides testing kits (usually for free) to make sure that whatever you may take doesn't contain fentanyl and is what you think it is.
https://dancesafe.org/

Also, here is a local resource for Naloxone kits. Naloxone is an overdose reversal drug for opiate type drugs like fentanyl. I don't know if your residence halls have it on hand, but they should and if anyone is comfortable having that discussion with their RA or whoever you might suggest they get a kit for the floor or building.

Here is a local organization that supplies Naloxone kits:

‚Ä¢ if there is a loop and a metro and you are not going off campus then please take the loop.

‚Ä¢ avoid hopping on the back of Metros (loops you can) the drivers count each person that gets on the bus, this allows them to see how frequently used the buses are which gives them the information to keep or remove certain bus routes. 

‚Ä¢busses get crowded, move to the back of the bus to make room for those coming in. If you are scared of sitting by a stranger give someone else the spot.

1ctxie2,UCSC,This is why protesting graduation is a bad idea:,"people who would protest this graduation think that it will effect the school as an institution rather than the actual students who have dedicated the last four years of their lives to getting a degree. 

Some of these students are first generation graduates whose parents only wanted them to get through college and risk their lives so that they could see their kids walk across this stage. Some of these students have put themselves through college themselves working themselves to de*th everyday while doing school full time so they can receive their diploma. Some of them are doing this to help their family. Not everyone who is walking across this stage is some privileged individual getting paid by Daddy‚Äôs money. 

These students lost their highschool graduation in covid. I know it sounds superficial to complain about in the grand scheme of the atrocities happening in the world right now. But another persons pain shouldnt diminish another‚Äôs. 

I know it sounds bad but also i would like to say i support the protest, but i think that protesting at graduation is only going to harm the students, not the institution, which is WHAT THUS PROTEST SHOULD BE DOING. The students aren‚Äôt the problem, the UC system is. It is selfish and careless to protest a graduation, there are better methods. Don‚Äôt do it like this.

1d5r4c9,UCSC,I just needed to share my complicated feelings on the whole thing.,"I would like to preface my thoughts my stating that I do not support the Israeli government's treatment of the people of Palestine over their country's history. The people of Palestine I believe have been grossly oppressed and subject to unfathomable and generational tragedies and to describe any current events as anything less than a genocide is both false and misleading. The bombing of innocent men, women, and children in designated safe zones is among the worst acts against humanity that will likely ever have occur in my lifetime. I do not agree with any educational institutions, businesses,  or governments that choose to turn a blind eye as they may in any way support the attempted erasure of people of any culture. I believe if the UC is actively engaging in any practices that directly fund and support Israel's attacks on Gaza, they should withdraw and use those funds to support the student body ands university faculty that currently struggle with rising housing costs, food insecurity, and any additional hardships that come along with working and being a student in one of the most expensive counties in the state. 

With that being said,  recent protests on our campus have affected the daily lives of much of us living and employed by the UC. Initially,  I was generally supportive of many of the actions taken my protesters and am still supportive to some degree of the several protesters whom I personally know. I genuinely believe a majority of protesters are just trying to do the right thing and for that I applaud you. However, as these demonstration, which began at the beginning of May, have progressed I have found myself uncomfortable with being able to publicly support or align myself with those organizing the protests. After digging a little deeper on SJP and attempting to educate myself on the entire tragedy occurring in Gaza (an education that is still in progress today), I feel like this is an even MORE complex and harrowing world event then SJP and the media are letting on. I view this situation as the result of two governments waging war on each other at the expense of their people, with Palestinians being dealt immense suffering as a result of the action of both governments. 

I can not actively support an organization that publicly commends the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel that killed and held hostage many innocent citizens including children. While I understand and agree that the Israeli government was directly responsible due to their actions leading up to October 7 as well as for their humanitarian crimes against Gaza in the many decades prior, I do not believe in justifying immense violence with more immense violence.  That day was a tragedy for many families and, while admittedly the legacy and impact of that day is still ongoing, I do not believe any acts of extreme violence are to be celebrated as is admittedly common in the West. This kind of violence is always a tragedy be it in victory or defeat.

This event, however, in no way excuses the sins of the Israeli government against the Palestinian people both since and before October 7, 2023. As a matter of fact, the atrocities committed by Israel are once again among the most abhorrent in this world's history and the generational and global trauma of these actions will never cease to exist. What we are witnessing is in fact a genocide. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Anyone who interprets my views on October 7 and Hamas as being supportive of Netanyahu and the response by Israel is gravely mistaken. Once again,  immense violence does not justify more immense violence. Prayers for Gaza do not suffice, world leaders must take action to stop these atrocities,  but unfortunately they do not seem interested in doing so and more people will suffer in the days and months and potentially years to come. 

I wanted to ensure I summarized my thoughts clearly on the matter before discussing my views on the protest because right now our community is more divided then ever. I do not want my views to be misconstrued as Anti-Palestine and Anti-protest when the very opposite true. The first ammendment is a beautiful thing and should be protected and practiced at all costs and I do believe that the deep in the heart of this protest is something very pure and good. Unfortunately, there's enough around that that makes me feel uncomfortable in a way that is unintentional. I do not agree with the demand to end or disband Jewish communities or organizations in our community. While I support the protesters exercising their first amendment right,  I do NOT agree with attempting to infringe on the first ammendment right of others in our community, with hateful speech and rhetoric being the only exception to the rule. While some Jewish members of our community are possibly supportive of Israel,  I do not believe our disagreements should come at the cost of their right to community and they have as much a right to their beliefs as we do to ours as long as those beliefs don't lead to hatefulness and bigotry. I believe cutting off our Jewish organizations will simply cause more strife and division and set a dire precedent for the future of our community both during and after our time here. During this time of contention, I believe we should be talking and listening to each other in order to come up with as a clear a possible picture on the effects that these world events had had on the entirety of our community not just ourselves, though I will admit that feels unrealistic and given current times it is foolish of me to expect people to set aside their differences in an attempt to understand one another's beliefs.

On the demonstrations by protesters themselves,  I have been disappointed by the reactions of both sides. Many have used the protests as an excuse to be grossly Islamophobic and threaten/encourage violence against members of our community who are protesting, for which those people should be ashamed of themselves. Others have used the protest to promote antisemitic beliefs and self aggrandize themselves while incidentally making the cause less about the suffering in Gaza and more about standing up to the authority. Shame on you as well. I will not discuss the blocking of roads and the incidents that may have occurred during that as I admittedly don't know the full story,  but it is a bad look for everybody when people are talking about ramming other members of our community with their vehicles and others were posting video of themselves antagonizing police and the Vice Chancellor. Once again,  immense violence does not justify immense violence. 

As a member of this community I've been greatly saddened by what has transpired. That being said,  I'm looking forward to listening and learning from my community. I want to understand the situation more and my views,  though complicated as they are,  are still incomplete and I look forward to actively participating in the discussing so I can be better informed. Maybe that way this post one day will be deemed irrelevant or maybe they'll just be proven even more. Who knows. I just would like to better understand everyone in my community. Thank you to those who took the time to read or respond I appreciate it.

Yes we need to protest the injustices of the world but how does coming into the Physical Sciences building during an event encourage anyone to divest from Israel? 

A few years back when Kerr was occupied, protesters forced the employees working in their offices out by shouting at them, banging on walls and desks. That resulted in many employees being afraid to come back to the building (and I think part of the building was kept locked 24/7). The occupation was otherwise handled really well, but the ‚Äúhostile takeover‚Äù of staff areas was unjustified, and was not a deciding factor in the outcome of the protest - it was done without necessity.

and what makes it SO MUCH WORSE is that when i get on the bus, everyone in the ADA seating looks at me. then looks at my (very obvious) mobility aids. then averts their eyes in hopes they won't have to give me their seat.

look i get it. you want to sit down. but i and other disabled people need those seats. there's a reason the seats at the front of the bus say ""reserved for elderly and people with disabilities"" (because the row seats aren't ADA accessible, just the side-facing front ones).

i can't stand for very long without extreme pain. i can't hold myself up when the bus is in motion. i can't hold onto any of the overhead rails. disabled people are the reason those seats are there, so PLEASE try to respect that.

I never thought I'd be posting something like this, but here I am. I've been living at the UCSC Trailer Park for two years now, but lately, I‚Äôve been having some unexplainable and unnerving encounters.

It all started around mid winter quarter when I began noticing small muddy footprints around my trailer early in the mornings, almost like they were left by tiny shoes. I brushed it off at first, thinking it was just the raccoon that I see once a week or my imagination. But then, things got weirder.

One night, I woke up to the sound of high-pitched giggling and rustling outside my camper. When I peeked out the window, I swear I saw small, shadowy figures darting around the trees. They were just the right size and shape to be gnomes, I‚Äôm dead serious.

I‚Äôve also found little trinkets ‚Äì buttons, tiny tools, and what looks like miniature clothing ‚Äì scattered around my trailer space. Sometimes, I feel like I'm being watched, especially when I‚Äôm outside after dark. A few of my neighbors have mentioned hearing strange noises and seeing odd lights in the woods, too.

I know this all sounds crazy, but it's been genuinely frightening. I've considered setting up some cameras to catch whatever (or whoever) is behind this, but I'm also worried about what I might find. Has anyone else at UCSC Trailer Park experienced anything similar? Any advice on how to deal with this?

Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have.

Stay safe, only two more weeks.


EDIT:  Thank you all for the comments, no I am not on drugs haha.

Dear UC Santa Cruz Community,

I write this  morning to share with you that after repeated unanswered calls to have  the unlawful encampment voluntarily disband and remove the dangerous  blockade from the campus entrance, we made the decision to request law  enforcement to remove the blockade and encampment. Law enforcement  removed the barricade and the encampment; however, some demonstrators  remain at the main entrance of campus. We continue to ask the campus and  the community to avoid that area.

We understand  there is much grief, anger, and frustration about the events that  continue to unfold in Gaza and Israel, and the immense suffering of  innocent people. I believe that many who have engaged in these protests  over these many weeks are well-intentioned and attempting to make change  through their spheres of influence. Unfortunately, the disruptions we  experienced these weeks were harmful to others in our community. This  decision was not made because individuals demonstrated; it was because  they have chosen to do so through unlawful actions.

The road blockades,  with fortified and chained barricades made of pallets and other  materials, and other unlawful actions disrupted campus operations and  threatened safety, including delaying access of emergency vehicles. We  have attempted to avoid conflict or the involvement of law enforcement  to address the encampment disruptions over the past month. We have  consistently communicated to encampment organizers that campus safety  and security are our highest priorities. In one particularly worrisome  incident Tuesday, an emergency medical vehicle was prevented from  entering a facility in which a toddler was in distress. Minutes and  seconds can be the difference between life and death in an emergency.  Actions such as this demonstrate a  continued lack of regard for our campus community.

Since the  encampment began, first at the Quarry Plaza and then at the main  entrance, participants have been given repeated, clear directions to  address safety issues, cease camping and cease blocking access to  numerous campus resources and to the campus itself. Early this morning,  they were also given multiple warnings by law enforcement to leave the  area and disband to avoid arrest. Unfortunately, many refused to follow  this directive and a number of individuals were arrested.

Having law  enforcement remove the unlawful encampment from campus is not an action  we wanted to take or have taken lightly. For the past month, we have  sought to de-escalate campus disruptions and road blockades, and  encouraged the voluntary disbanding of the unlawful encampments. The  individuals at the encampments have been repeatedly informed about the  policies that their actions violated. They continued to ignore  university directives, including those related to safety, and have  sought conflict, actively escalating tensions within our campus  community, harming those who are simply trying to learn, teach, and do  their jobs in support of our educational mission.

Despite  negotiating in good faith over the course of a full week when the  encampment first began at the Quarry Plaza in an effort to reach its  voluntary removal, we were unable to come to an agreement that was  within our authority and aligned with the values of UC Santa Cruz. As  the chancellor for the entire university, I must be firm when the  demands of one group undermine the rights of others. In this case, the  demonstrators demanded that we end relationships with organizations that  support our Jewish students and funders that support important student  success work and happen to be Jewish organizations. They demanded that  UC Santa Cruz divest from and boycott companies affiliated with Israel, a  demand that the  [UC Office of the President has already addressed and deemed unacceptable](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-divestment).  Most worryingly, they demanded that we curtail the foundational right  of academic freedom by condemning the use of funding from select federal  agencies. Functionally, the encampment wanted to prevent our  researchers from pursuing research related to topics with which they  disagree. This is a dangerous precedent and to give in to it would  undermine academic freedom and make our academic community vulnerable to  the values of whatever political force seeks to prevent free inquiry.

As we have shared  in previous messages, we continue to be ardent supporters of free  speech. While some actions by individuals fall within First Amendment  protection, many other activities over the past weeks did not, and  should be called what they were: unlawful disruptions, vandalism, and  intentional harming of our community. Because of this morning‚Äôs events,  the campus community will continue to notice a higher presence of law  enforcement on campus.

We know there will  be disagreement about this decision and the steps taken to support  campus safety. However, our ultimate responsibility is for the safety  and well-being of this campus. It was a necessary decision at a critical  time.

Sincerely,  
 	Cindy

1gzr16r,UCSC,Disturbing encounter at Baskin Engineering,"PSA: do not let anyone into the building.
Last night I was sitting on the table in front of the far exit by the second floor balcony, reading a children's book to quell my insomnia. A man walks past, gives me a thumbs up (?), and returns a minute later carrying a metal bowl (?) asking to be let in. He looks like a student but is late 20s with a tanned wrinkly smile. He's says ""thank you, my friend"" and goes inside. Everything is normal.
Then he returns and sits on the table to ""see the vantage point I have"" of the balcony railing. He talks exuberantly extroverted so I just grey rock till he leaves again. His demeanor is very giddy and innocent, ""didn't mean to scare you"", yada yada so I felt I would have to reassure him or justify myself if I said anything negative.
Then he returns again, bringing a cup of water, ""in case I'm thirsty"" and is strangely insistent about my drinking it. I'm weirded out but insomnia causes me to blank so I just let him chatter and he goes away again. I just assume some people have good intentions in spite of lacking self awareness.
Then he returns again, dragging a couch! If anyone sees an orange couch by the exit, that's how it got there. Now I'm horrified by his exertion and realize that he's wearing shades indoors so pepper spray might not be effective. I book it as soon as he leaves. I just felt cornered and isolated late at night in a space I thought was cozy.
Now I'm fuming. It's not technically harassment because I never said no, but I want others to be aware that there's a weird man, not sure if it would violate any rules if I were to describe him but he lurks in Baskin Engineering late at night, and there's a reason we're told not to let anyone in.

After working with the school, I built a tool call Slugtistics that shares UCSC grade data to all students! Slugtistics is an application designed to provide students with valuable insights into grade distributions. Students can use this tool to better gauge the difficulty of their classes before deciding their quarter's workload.

1d3cqmh,UCSC,The point of civil disobedience is supposed to be to get arrested. It's used to challenge unjust laws afterwards in court. Blocking roads for hours isn't civil disobedience; it's just good ol' law breaking.,"To me the most bizarre aspect of the road closures yesterday is the fact that the involvement of police was somehow seen as authoritarian overreach. When you break laws on purpose as a form of protest, you can't be shocked‚Äî SHOCKED!‚Äî when police are called and you are arrested. 

The question is, once you're arrested, are you able to show that the law was unjust? Lunch counter segregations were unjust, so civil rights protestors disobeyed and won. Bus segregation and ""separate but equal"" in schools were additional examples. 

So by any reasonable metric, the only possible rationale for closing downs roads on campus is, you feel the existence of those roads is unjust. Maybe you feel that cars should be illegal? And you want to have your day in court to make your case that campus entrances shouldn't be passable. That's fine‚Äî if that's your goal then road closures as a form of protest make sense. 

But violating laws is *not* just a louder form of free speech. It's not something you have the right to do with first amendment protection. Unless you can show that traffic laws are unjust, then violating them is just violating them. There are lots of other laws you could violate to make a louder noise too‚Äî you could rob banks or blow things up. But neither of those is protected speech either. 

When you break laws that you don't actually consider unjust and don't intend to challenge in court, and especially when you expect to do so without consequences, it's your expectation of privilege that is showing. Everyone is subject to the same laws‚Äî the fact that you're a student at an elite educational institution does not exempt you. In the act of violating laws, not to change them, but just to call attention to yourselves, you're just common criminals.",-0.73,Politics

We have Pro-Israel supporters claiming that virtually any criticisms or lack of support for their party warrants the label of ‚Äúantisemitism‚Äù, which is an absolutely heinous label and completely unwarranted (the same could be said for Pro-Palestine supporters tossing around the label ‚Äúanti muslim‚Äù). This is such an incredibly complex and nuanced topic, but I just feel like everywhere I look there‚Äôs another black and white viewpoint. It‚Äôs so draining to be surrounded by this topic everywhere I look, having everyone speak on it, but all most of us are doing is running around in circles playing the blame game. Constantly berating each other, shouting out unreasonable demands/ ideologies and expecting everyone to just be complacent and all falling victim to the concept that to be in support and uplift one group means taking something away from another. I guess that‚Äôs all I really have to say for my rant, anything else would just be redundant at this point, but I am really curious to hear how others are feeling.

The victim stated he witnessed an unknown male suspect batter another male subject. The suspect was with 4-5 other unidentified suspects. The suspect then turned his attention towards the victim and battered and robbed him, taking the victims‚Äô cell phone.  
Later the same evening, the victim located¬†the suspects near parking lot 167 (at the ILC). The¬†victim attempted to retrieve his property back from the suspect. The suspect then battered and extorted the student's password from him and subsequently stole an unknown amount of money. At this time one of the 4-5 subjects with the suspect assisted in the assault.

&gt;The suspects may have driven from lot 167 in an unknown vehicle.¬†

&gt;The suspect is described as a Hispanic male in his early 20's, approximately 5'3 to 5'4"", having short, black bowl cut style hair, and a tattoo on the left side of his eye, possibly a Roman numeral. The suspect¬†was last seen wearing a black hoodie, black pants, and possibly white shoes.

Going to parties off-campus in the forest is your own choice but bad shit always happens usually. These parties are public and often posted to public instagram accounts. I've gone to some and have seen many people who don't look like they're students that are upwards of 30+ years old looking to prey on people. I know people who've been or seen people drugged and robbed at parties and never reported it.

This is a university which also means it's a target. A lot of people already come here to steal bikes. It's never the victim's fault. But you should always prioritize staying away from vulnerable situations over getting your shoes dirty over a boring forest party where you stand around and do nothing.

Clearly your care doesn‚Äôt even extend to people on (or coming to) campus and I see no reason why we should care about your cause. You won‚Äôt even care about our need to get stuff done and get home to families, animals, or even just to get home for ourselves. You know, basic level of care for someone else. 

I honestly doubt you guys would have even moved for an ambulance, fire truck, or someone in need of police.

1gek1sw,UCSC,Anyone else dealing with roommates being super inconsiderate?,"I swear to god, I cannot be the only one dealing with this shit. When I applied for housing, I specifically put down I wanted roommates who were clean and went to bed by 12. I don‚Äôt even fall asleep then, but I‚Äôll chill in the dark til I do bc sometimes I do need to go to sleep that early and I don‚Äôt wanna be kept up. Then I ended up with a roommate who plays games on their computer until like 1 and leaves their lamp on, shining basically directly in my face when I‚Äôm in bed. After they‚Äôve decided they‚Äôre good and done, they‚Äôll shut off their computer and start fumbling around with their desk and closet very loudly for a few minutes before going to take a shower and practically doing everything in their power to not close the door softly. As soon as they leave, I always have to shut their lamp off so I can try to sleep. Then when they finish their shower, they‚Äôll do the exact same thing with the door and turn on ANOTHER LAMP!!! They don‚Äôt even use it for anything, they just like having the light on until they sleep and it floods the entire room. And only when they decide they‚Äôve had enough of fun little light time (which is at about 2am if I‚Äôm lucky), will they shut it off and do whatever they do at night, since they‚Äôre asleep practically any time they‚Äôre not in class, too! I am genuinely so exhausted during the days when I have early morning classes and can‚Äôt make up the lost sleep by staying in bed til like 11am. I‚Äôve tried an eye mask, but I can‚Äôt stand the feeling and the earplugs I‚Äôm forced to use every night only go so far to block out noise from someone who doesn‚Äôt even try to care at all. And my makeshift blanket curtain can only block so much light without making my bed a whole sauna.

And on top of all this, my other roommate has decided they are now going for the Guinness world record of most Amazon boxes in a fucking dorm. They leave them all over and always say they‚Äôll deal with them ‚Äútomorrow.‚Äù Spoiler alert! Tomorrow has been the past 3 whole weeks! Yayyy! Both of them also just adore leaving shoes in the center of the room or thrown around so people can trip over them easier, which is real kind of them!

Yea I know it coulda been a whole lot worse, which is absolutely fucking insane to have to say, but this is getting ridiculous. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm in the wrong on this shit for being pissed. Did literally everyone put the same roommate preferences to get good roommates so they could all be inconsiderate and unaccommodating?

1hhpizi,UCSC,Urgent - CA Declares State of Emergency Due to Bird Flu,"Folks, Bird Flu became a concern in the beginning of the year, but it was limited to a few instances and there wasn't much reaction to it except in a few places. Namingly, one of them was California which demanded that cattle be tested in order to avoid (and now seemingly, prepare for another) global epidemic.

**This specific strain, as of now, does not transmit from person to person, but scientists say it has the potential to mutate very quickly and become contagious.**

**And here is the kicker, unlike COVID, which has a mortality rate of 2%, the H5N1 Bird Flu has a mortality rate of 60% percent.**

Currently, the patient zero is hospitalized in the state of Louisiana.

And closer to UCSC, a child was infected with it in Alameda County in November this year.

Please take the following precautions:  

* If you work with birds, cattle, and, or in diary farms, you're at a great risk of being infected. Please get tested and follow the basic guidelines to avoid the contamination of your home, workplace, and other dwelling areas.  


* Avoid walking on areas with bird droppings. The child in Alameda County was not in contact with any animal, so, presumably, they likely got infected through secondary contact with birds.  


* Do not drink raw and unpasteurized milk or products made from unpasteurized milk.  


* Avoid getting near dead birds or cattle. Make sure to take off your shoes before entering your house to ensure you don't contaminate your dwelling place through secondary contact.  


* As of now, pasteurized milks sold in stores are safe, but the same cannot be said for poultry. Make sure to cook poultry products, including eggs, thoroughly.  


* Keep track of what you touch throughout the day. Doorknobs, chairs, desks, gas station pump handles, and other such places are a great hotspot for microbes. If you touch any of them, do not touch your face (especially mouth, nose, and eyes) until you have thoroughly washed your hands with soap. And similarly, keep your phones as clean as you would your face since they're almost always with you and could become a portable hub for viruses.  


* The H5N1 Bird Flu infection has similar symptoms to common cold, but it distinctly also causes conjunctivitis (Pink Eye) which may or may not include discharge from your eyes as well.  



Stay safe folks!

UCSC is at the bottom of all the UCs currently. When you look at USNWR they place Merced and Riverside above SC. Additionally, when people outside of California hear UCSC they think of it as the lesser known satellite campus to the peer schools UC Berkeley and UCLA. The reputation of the school is mainly regional, not national.

The school has increased admissions to over 63% for Fall 2024 admits. This means that our yield rate is lower than before. A few years ago I remember UCSC's acceptance rate being around 40-48%.

1dl94jl,UCSC,GOODBYE TAPS: The thing I am happiest to leave behind after graduation,"(This is copied and pasted from a comment I made in response to someone saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just like the rest of us‚Äù)

They are NOT all ‚Äújust like the rest of us.‚Äù I waited in the TAPS office line for an hour to buy a temp R permit on commencement day 1 (Friday; they made all yearly R permits expire on a Thursday) only for the employee who had been overly touchy (touching people‚Äôs elbows and lower backs while scooting through the line) and passive aggressive all morning to smile in my face and tell me ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt just give an R permit to anybody :) You must have a valid housing extension email if you want to park in the West Remote today.‚Äù No ‚Äúsorry,‚Äù no other options provided.

I would be fine with hearing that if she hadn‚Äôt been so overstimulating and inappropriate all morning AND if she literally had any compassion and didn‚Äôt kick me out of the line immediately without any say.

I didn‚Äôt have an extended housing contract because I was sleeping over with my friend who lives in a single for the night AND I already stated that I‚Äôm a student who‚Äôs had an R permit all year and just needed the temp one for ONE DAY at the West Remote (WHICH turned out to be half empty the entire day of in retrospect).

So I went to pick up my friend who I was staying with that had extended housing (mind you this whole process started at SEVEN AM and it‚Äôs 9 by now) and felt bad because I had to wake them up on our commencement day (we both relied on my vehicle for accessibility that day).

We hauled our asses back into the TAPS office line (also large headache due to there not being any available parking with half a mile) and stood there for 30 minutes. This time, we got lucky and were placed with another TAPS worker.

Here‚Äôs the fucking kicker: she informed us that my friend did not need to be there and since I was a student with a preexisting R permit that I could just simply buy it myself. WHAT I HAD BEEN TRYING TO DO WITH THE LADY AN HOUR AGO BEFORE.

I went ahead and purchased it, feeling terrible that my friend had to wake up earlier on his commencement day and even angrier at the other unqualifiedly rude and now knowingly misinformed TAPS worker.

I decided to ask the competent worker in front of me if she could relay what she told me to the other workers primarily so that the rest of them (especially the one I dealt with) had the proper information but also secondarily so that especially the worker I dealt with could maybe not be so fucking smug.

The lady who I thought was competent misunderstood me and told me she had no way to testify for what other workers said and that she only knew what she knew.

Huh??? I get you‚Äôre stressed right now, but I‚Äôm not asking you to incriminate your coworker‚ÄîI‚Äôm simply asking you to make sure your team is handing out the right information and not making people wait two hours for a simple permit. I tried to repeat this once more to no avail, so I just said thank you and *got the fuck out of that lousy TAPS office for the last time.*

I have NEVER had a pleasant customer service experience with them, and their sassiness is definitely not deserved because they can‚Äôt do their jobs half the time. The two or three times I had to call them throughout my college career they have ALWAYS answered snippily or passive aggressively or with a sigh to start off the call before I‚Äôd even get to say anything.

The one thing that got me through that entire 3 hour debacle was the knowledge that I never had to deal with ANY of those disrespectful workers EVER again after that day. Some of them are nice and mind their business (like some loop drivers and other staff), but WAY TOO MANY OF THEM DON‚ÄôT.

(EDIT: Also I just thought of many instances where this one old black-haired lady with sunglasses and a perpetual stink face was rude AF when driving the loop around too and realized she was also a TAPS worker, so she gets criticism too. She always opened her door and without any time to breathe would immediately start yelling at the people outside to hurry up and that ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt have all day‚Äù EVERY TIME I SAW HER. I once asked her if she was going to the West Remote and she acted like I made the most confusing question ever and then later yelled at me saying, ‚ÄúI hope y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt expecting me to go to the base of campus.‚Äù üòí)

**TL;DR: I waited for an hour to get a temporary R permit on commencement day, only to be told by a rude TAPS employee that I needed a housing extension email, despite being a student with a valid permit all year. After waking my friend with an extended housing contract and returning to the TAPS office, another worker informed me I could have bought the permit without my friend. Frustrated, I asked the competent worker to ensure the team had the right information, but she misunderstood. This experience reinforced my negative view of TAPS' unhelpful and often rude customer service.**",-0.85,Mental Health

I am wondering what the proper methods for resolving this situation should be.

1daokgw,UCSC,UC‚Äôs Temporary Restraining Order Granted,"Source text:
  

June 7 Media Contact: media@ucop.edu 
  
A Superior Court judge today granted a temporary restraining order to the University of California, temporarily halting the illegal systemwide strike by UAW-represented employees across campuses.
  
The action comes after UC filed a lawsuit and requested injunctive relief Tuesday against UAW for breach of contract. UC and UAW have collective bargaining agreements that each have no-strike clauses. UAW-represented UC employees began striking on May 20 at UC Santa Cruz and the strike has expanded to six of the 10 systemwide campuses.
  
‚ÄúWe are extremely grateful for a pause in this strike so our students can complete their academic studies. The strike would have caused irreversible setbacks to students‚Äô academic achievements and may have stalled critical research projects in the final quarter,‚Äù said Melissa Matella, associate vice president for Systemwide Labor Relations.
  
‚ÄúFrom the beginning, we have stated this strike was illegal and a violation of our contracts‚Äô mutually agreed upon no-strike clauses,‚Äù Matella added. ‚ÄúWe respect the advocacy and progressive action towards issues that matter to our community and our community‚Äôs right to engage in lawful free speech activities ‚Äî activities that continue to occur across the system. However, UAW‚Äôs strike is unrelated to employment terms, violates the parties‚Äô agreements, and runs contrary to established labor principles.‚Äù While this is an important victory critical to support student success, the University will continue to pursue its legal claims in state court and PERB to protect labor peace across the system.",-0.27,Politics

Saturday, Nov. 30, is officially Small Business Saturday, and around the country, many small businesses are struggling. Many have found it hard to regain their footing post-pandemic as more consumers turn to online shopping.

One such company is Comicopolis, which has been selling comic books, games, puzzles and more for 27 years out of its downtown Santa Cruz shop. Last week, the store‚Äôs owners, Johnnie Arnold and Troy Geddes, posted a plea on Facebook, noting that they might have to close soon.

**‚ÄúWith everything the way it is, our little store has taken a beating this year. At this stage, we‚Äôre doing everything we possibly can to stay open but to be honest, it‚Äôs not looking great,‚Äù the post read.**

Comicopolis, located at 829 Front St. in Santa Cruz, is one of two comics stores downtown. Atlantis Fantasyworld is over at 1020 Cedar St.

Stay tuned for my story later this week about what‚Äôs led Comicopolis to call upon the community and how it, like many other small retailers, are feeling the pinch this year.

Since I started going here I've made friends but not a single one wants to hang out and whenever I reach out I get some kind of excuse. The most social interaction I've had is a one night stand with a girl that burned bright, was wonderful, and then burnt out quickly in two days when she basically said she didn't want to even interact any more.

I feel so isolated. I'm not really around anyone in my college demographic. All the clubs I'm in happen during class. I feel like I'm going fucking insane. I don't know where to go to meet people who are like me, I'm so far away from everything I should be a part of. I go on insta and I see all these people talking about their wonderful college experiences and I can't help but feel bitter because I'm waking up and going to sleep stressed and struggling to even interact normally because I just don't have the energy to put myself out there, because it hasn't amounted to anything.

What the fuck do I do? Therapy isn't helping. I'm running behind in classes. I've made 3 calls to 988 this month and I don't want one to be my last.",-0.83,Mental Health

Idgaf abt the dining hall takeovers. Nobody got hurt or nothing. The university didn‚Äôt even lose any money bc ppl with meal plans already paid for their food at the beginning of the quarter. It doesn‚Äôt fucking matter and I‚Äôm tired of the university acting like they lost sooooo much money from the very few free days the dining halls had. Those signs are annoying af too.",-0.83,Social

After not seeing copies of Unnatural History for years, I spoke to the author about having it reprinted, and with his go-ahead, I contacted Baytree Bookstore, where it was printed originally. I was then informed that they have 1000 copies in stock still, which came as a shock to me, the author, and probably everyone else who has been trying to hunt one down for years. I physically checked the bookstore today and there is definitely a whole stack, although they're not listed online.

,UCSC,,"Hey y'all! I made a list of tips and tricks for people living in the Kresge Residential Halls this year. I lived in them last year so I figured that people might want to know what it was like. Here's some tips! I probably forgot a lot, soo... Oops! A lot of this is specified at Kresge people, but I've been told that there is also stuff that general UCSC frosh should know.

I did all of this in a google document first which is probably going to be much easier to read since there is a bunch of pictures and whatnot in there THAT DID NOT CARRY OVER TO REDDIT. I suggest you take a look at that version. Also, if and when I do updates to the doccument, I will NOT carry them over to the post (since thats work and im lazy).

The version you should look at with pictures: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit?usp=sharing)

EDIT: Big edit for a couple of things:

Apps, Keycards, and other major details were added to the main doccument. Minor things like ""Clothes hamper"" were added. Also, I made a checklist of essentials for you to bring and look at. Please take a look at it!

EDIT: Last edit on here. I know that the UCSC reddit page archives posts after a while, so just so y'all have some input still, I set up an email that I occasionally check up on for suggestions and stuff. Please let me know anything! Thanks!

Hey y‚Äôall! I lived in the new Kresge res halls the first year that they were open for students (2023-2024 school year) and I figured I‚Äôd give a couple of pictures (and tips) about what the living there will be like for the new freshmen:

Feel free to suggest anything that you think will be helpful to other people and I'll put it in!

# Dorm Rooms - Intro

Firstly, you will be living with roommates. There are plenty of resources out there for you to look at if you want some advice, but with two roommates, you will be pretty cramped in a room that looks like this:

(Note that there are two wardrobes to the sides of the walls that are not visible in the picture)

It will be pretty cramped, but that is now your space for the next year. Make it yours! (And by that, I mean move the hell out of that furniture)

# Over-analyzed Layout

So the following is kind of an over analysis of the room set-up and how it can be organized. These are all generalized measurements, but they are a pretty reasonable average for what you‚Äôll see in the dorm room since some are bigger and some are smaller. (The dorm rooms tend to be around 14ft x 9ft x 9ft)

The (approximate) dimensions of the model are

|**Dimensions**|**Furniture item**|
|:-|:-|
|3 inches x 1.5 inches|Beds|
|1 inch x .25 inch|Closets|
|1.75 inches x 1.25 inches|Desks|
|1 inch x 11/16 inch|Fridge|
|7/8 inch x .5 inch|Trash &amp; Recycle|
|4 3/16 inch x 7 3/16 inch|Room/Box|

Note that the loft is to the side to show that there is stuff under it

Here is the original layout of the dorm room that you will probably arrive at:

Fun! Joyous! Cramped as all get out. There isn‚Äôt much that you can really do to the furniture but rotate it and move it slightly, but it makes all the difference! Check this out:

To me, the above version is WAYYY better since the person behind the door has a (decently) private changing area, the desks toward the back of the room have a lot more privacy, and the person under the loft has their own private space! WOO!¬†

‚ö† (Also, as a general tip, the person on top of the bunk should get the wardrobe behind the door unless they have a [great bed area](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit#heading=h.xrp8c5dzhoik) (covered later) so that they can put their crap on it)¬†

# Making your space yours (comfy :D )

# Command strips

Command strips were my best friend. I used them all the time. Hanging towels, backpacks, wall closets, trinkets, chotchkies, thingamabobs, everything. They are great and should feel great. Get a bunch with different kinds of hooks - the towel ones were my favorite, but ironically, not great for towels. You need to spread them out, so you‚Äôll need to use two if you want to actually dry your towel.

‚ö†‚ö†‚ö† **WARNING** ‚ö†‚ö†‚ö†

Make sure that the pull off tab for your strip is VISIBLE. If not, they will rip the wall like a bikini wax. I didn‚Äôt get charged by UCSC when my wall got its ‚Äúnew look‚Äù, but watch out for that when you put yours up.

# Great Bed Area

Having a great bed area is wayy necessary since that‚Äôs where you get your recharge (if you aren‚Äôt passed out in the woods). From me to you, you need to make it a good place for you to spend your time in. Here is some photos and some tips that I have (with things in the photo):

|| || |Item to bring|Notes (about said thing)| |Bedding|Have good bedding. A fitted sheet, a sheet, and a blanket/LIGHT comforter should be all you really need. Bring a second, heavier blanket if you think that you‚Äôll need it and whatever else you think you‚Äôll need, but bring at LEAST that.| |Pillows|I am a pillow guy. I like my pillows. Bring a couple but no more than 3 because there is nowhere to put them.¬†| |Boxes|Weird, I know, but extremely necessary. I lived in the bed above the trash cans and my pillow once FELL INTO THE TRASH. I‚Äôll spare you the details of what was in the can, but from experience, trust me, you want some kind of barrier keeping your stuff from going into the ether. My go-to was [these free boxes from USPS](https://store.usps.com/store/product/priority-mail-flat-rate-large-box-P_LARGE_FRB) that worked for this and so much more. \*\*If there is one thing off of this list I‚Äôd suggest, it‚Äôs this.\*\*| |Tissues (optional)|I am stuffed up literally all the time - tissues were a must for me, especially when flu season was around.| |Bedside Wall Mount¬† (AKA Wall closet)|I loved this because it helped out with holding all of the crap I had in my bed. Headphones, Fan, phone (for a while, see below), chapstick, cords. It did the job! I convinced my roommate to get one and he loved it too. [This was mine](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YDK5HMV/?coliid=IM9I8E7FZ45ET&amp;colid=J3DANLCZH467&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=list_c_wl_gv_cv_lig_pi_dp), but there are a bunch of similar designs out there.| |Phone holder (optional)|When the wall closet wasn‚Äôt enough, I got a wall phone holder. It was nice to just know where my phone was. I got [something like this](https://www.amazon.com/Adhesive-Receiving-Charging-Compatible-Android/dp/B08JCV99W5) off of temu for 3 cents, but look around!| |Water Bottle Caddy (Optional)|I like to drink water right before I go to bed, so this was nice to have so I didn‚Äôt have to get up every time I wanted a sip| |Sleep Mask (optional)|My roommates often went to bed later than I did. They would be fine with turning the lights off, but the glare of their computers was a lot at 2 am.| |Earplugs (optional)|I didn‚Äôt use these, but my roommate did, and it was the make or break for his sleep a lot of the time. (Definitely unrelated, make sure that you get them in the trash once you are done with them. Accidentally stepping on these barefoot is nasty)| |Fan (optional)¬†|I lived in a cooler climate than California before moving to UCSC, and since there is no AC in the dorms, this was necessary for me. The light isn‚Äôt really necessary to have since you kids have your phones and newfangled devices. Also, I have definitely flashbanged the room before trying to turn the fan on, so there‚Äôs a bit of caution. I had something like this one, but it‚Äôs not the exact model.¬† Note that you‚Äôll have to bring an extra long cord to keep it charged| |Cords|I loved my cords. I had two cords leading up to my bed, one was USB C and one was microUSB. I suggest you get 10 ft cords regardless of if you live in a top or bottom bed, but especially to those living in the loft or top bunk. You‚Äôll also need something to keep them up there, so keep that in mind. I used my wall closet organizer thingy, but you can use velcro command strips and sandwich it in there, or any number of other things.| |Pajamas|This one isn‚Äôt in the picture, but you will probably want some PJ‚Äôs to have since you are sleeping with two strangers. It makes things a hell of a lot easier when there is a 3am fire alarm too.|

# Great living area

I had the loft, and lived under that loft. It was great and had the best private space in the room. It may not have the relaxation that the bottom bunk has, but it was dang great.¬†

|| || |Item|Notes (about said thing)| |Lockbox|You don‚Äôt know your roomates, so recommended if you have some valuables (like emergency money or something). Maybe get a small one that looks like a book instead of a chest.| |Curtains|This is very specifically for the people who claimed the desk under the loft, AND for the people who claimed the bottom bunk bed. You can make it into an amazing personal space cut off from everything else in the room if you get some blackout curtains. They did wonders for me, and hopefully you too.| |Boxes|Use it to store stuff, as a trash can, as a cold-shielder, etc. Get creative!¬† [These are free boxes from USPS ](https://store.usps.com/store/product/priority-mail-flat-rate-large-box-P_LARGE_FRB)so use them how you want!| |Slippers|Great if you don‚Äôt want to get shoes on and aren‚Äôt going that far| |Extension cord|In these images, you can see it under the towel. I suggest you get one that has USB ports so you can do whatever you want with it.| |Kettle (optional) (for ramen, tea, etc.)|The following isn‚Äôt about the kettle, I just want to rave about some tea that I have been loving for years. The [egyptian licorice tea from Yogi](https://www.amazon.com/Yogi-Egyptian-Licorice-Count-Packaging/dp/B010NBHIDC/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3KD2CKKUQYMNG&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1mH7h58dontPSp76ltKaha7s9gCZ_jio0mRYUcTIiFGr24ktcF0n-Jj8o_tRdkqvBrMqvb3_a0DMI8EYl319pwY06fPOLFuP0DoMpQJAP_4vuxLgrNm1-9W09R_nvHt7LyAK0BtDfWZZmGY3J3FwFYex_wCCk7gxjDUot8BNNBMGyvqzLTh7AY0M9mp4bEc4wvPBSsXTylITdSUB70XGYPnfaZ9piSlKQvZojfwhh1gg_9AlUR7AKvKqFePI3LHa.CZqqNLZT0OspP-lTr4fiJ-5xN7EO-EHE-NqylUph-JQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=yogi+licorice+tea&amp;qid=1725604660&amp;sprefix=yogi+lic%2Caps%2C311&amp;sr=8-6) has converted licorice haters into okayers, and it is AMAZING.¬†| |Command hooks|Use it for anything (towels are the main thing). Pretty cool.¬†| |Lamp|Hidden in the back of one of the pictures you can see my lamp. It had a flexible neck so I could point it to wherever it needed to be. I got [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095X5LYL6/?coliid=I13IDM7QQT1PN2&amp;colid=J3DANLCZH467&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=list_c_wl_gv_cv_lig_pi_dp) since it also had a pen caddy. Great for nights that your roommates go to bed early and you need to finish that work you forgot to turn in a week ago.| |Spacer for shelf (See Note)|This is very situational - I set my desk in this orientation, and the shelf on top of the desk is very liable to go off the desk when pushed from the outside. Putting spacers here (shoes in my case) will save you a lot of headaches and cleanups.| |Dishware|Up to you to bring what you want - just know the hassles: Bring You decide Don‚Äôt bring Tupperware Spoons, Forks, Knives - If you are okay with plundering, you can take a set or two from the dining hall and return them at the end of the year Cups - I suggest it because cups are great to have, but if you want, a pack of red solo cups does the job in most cases (not for instant mac and cheese tho, mugs are way better than plastic cups and paper bowls). Plates - Hassle to wash and you can get paper plates at the markets Bowls - Same thing with plates Any cookware - No kitchen|

# Great Bath Routine

So this is a bit of a stretch to the whole ‚Äúyour space‚Äù thing, but I argue that a good bathroom routine makes for a happy person. Same thing as above: Here‚Äôs a picture and some things to bring/have that relate.

Also, if you don‚Äôt have anyone who needs it on your floor, opt to use the handicap toilet and shower - it‚Äôs so much more space and there is another shower head if you need something

|| || |Item to bring|Notes (about said thing)| |Robe (or other before/after shower garments)|Cool to have. I like not having to grasp a towel while punching in a pin to get back into my room as well as my other stuff.¬†| |Towel|duh| |Shower caddy|To take all of your stuffs I like the hanging version since there are big horizontal poles that the shower curtains are supposed to be on. They aren‚Äôt there since there are floor to ceiling doors, so using that to hang your stuff on is great. Also, you can [hang it on your bed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit#heading=h.ut5qwlynhj7v) when you get back to your room I [got this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PR7V9M7/?coliid=I3D6IDEHJ4MY48&amp;colid=J3DANLCZH467&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=list_c_wl_gv_cv_lig_pi_dp)| |Shower Shoes|I didn‚Äôt get a foot fungus when I was in the res-halls. Do you want to? If not, bring these. I [got these](https://www.amazon.com/XUANHSU-Bathroom-Slippers-Sandals-Swimming/dp/B07CK1M9MN/ref=is_sr_dp_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QRrIb1BNybna_SLp5dB71WPYFUkgLOApYbwHPzTFJIuH7fPqx5ASFgVlygze0XPJvCdrKp0Y_4bb1FYxJQl0YKCPXxAzRpulNHf4kjWMn3SsNypLEDjN2LtnGCsL9R94mWtLfJ_2JKPEjvu4BsyZI5duCsV8ye4XxTmkTdm01QVGp0L2DBqITRG1UbkLhmJVJnDsYpebj2Ke7mOr9_dzDVaXFSmmUM6b6G68fJiyNVzsDQ9Z91ZGsuu8kHCM4yJR92bBHDESdITnMa2wwpAcsM9DhOmsGtNvjxtZKuBiF_8.C6tDECRsUYBs_ifeFXt7JSamruW92gfVbsKU0XyPRu4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=shower+shoes&amp;qid=1725603418&amp;sr=8-6) and they were cool but there are tons of other models that work fine.¬†| |Toilet paper|Different kind of bathroom routine. You *CAN* use the UCSC provided stuff, but save that for napkins when you steal a roll. Really, you are going to want something better. I say get the Charmin Ultra Soft (since I treat myself), but anything is better than the 1/5th ply they give us.| |Rapid fire stuff:| |Shampoo|Toothpaste| |Conditioner|Razor¬†| |Body Wash|Brush| |Toothbrush|Gold bond powder (if you need it)| |Flossers (or string floss if you‚Äôre crazy)|‚Ä¶whatever else I can‚Äôt remember!| |Deodorant|

# Lights

There is a cool dual **light switch** in this room which allows you to light the overhead light for each side of the room. You can also dim the light so that it is super low, which is really nice.¬†

There is also a **roll-up blackout blind** which is a very nice touch. It does let light in, and can be noisy when rolling though

I don‚Äôt have a good pic, soooo here:

And this is how dark it gets at night (note that my phone camera is decent and let some light in the lens):

¬†Although it is dark, there are some lights that flash without anything in the room. The fire alarm and a smoke detector flash all the time, so you‚Äôll have to get used to it or a sleep mask

# Temperature

Okay, prepare yourself‚Ä¶ There is no AC. I know, I know. I‚Äôm sorry, there isn‚Äôt anything I can do. There is a heater with a radiator right next to the window, but that‚Äôs about all the control you‚Äôll have over temperature.

Radiator:

Also, you can control the heating in your dorm. This thermostat doesn‚Äôt give a whole lot of freedom, but enough so you can schedule the days and nights (you can do this in the bathroom and lounges but I didn‚Äôt tell you that). Just take the cover off and boom! No screwdriver needed. I didn‚Äôt go that far into finding the manual for this thing since you need to have an actual need for it and email some people and whatnot, but the bottom line is that you have this thermostat, and it‚Äôs pretty decent.

Note: Your heater will not work if the window is open. (See the ‚Äúhold‚Äù in the first pic vs the second) Same with the bathrooms and lounges.

# Fridge/Microwave

This combo that College Collegiate rents out is pretty neat. Make sure to return it at the end of the year though!

# Other Notes about the room

* The walls stain super easily. Rubbing your fingernail on there easy. Pretty much all of it comes off with a wet cloth or sponge, so you should be fine though
* The walls rip super easily. Just a reminder to be careful with [command strips ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit#heading=h.jycfzfx45u9v)and tape
* Chances are, your windows are going to be open 24/7. Make sure to close them during fire season though.
* The ceilings are wood. Pretty cool.
* Make sure you use [CruzFix ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit#heading=h.nf77x3lt39sz)anytime you have something broken. They might not fix it for a long time, so do it ASAP
* There are generally no random room searches (at least from my year). There were quarterly searches though, and it was just face-value. No drawer-opening or anything like that.¬†
* I don‚Äôt do drugs, but some other people on our floor did and set off the fire alarm. They got found out quick because of that. If you end up smoking something, do it in the woods literally 5 feet away. It's better than getting kicked out of UCSC.
* The fire alarms will trigger if you burn popcorn. DONT. BURN. POPCORN.
* There are wifi routers all over and speed is decent
   * These things
* Headphones are nice to have
* An ice tray is nice to have for the fall quarter
* Set ground rules with your roommates IMMEDIATELY and don‚Äôt be afraid to enforce them. Make them VERY strict. You probably won‚Äôt enforce them unless something really bugs you.
* There was construction last year (2024) that went from 8am to 6pm. It was LOUD.¬† Keep that in mind when you keep a window open.

# Outside Your Dorm

# Pinboard

Great for expressing your identity! At the beginning of the year my roommate had daily polls with pins that our floor LOVED.¬†

When you get to UCSC, this is how you will identify your room - there will be a paper with your name on it pinned to the pinboard. It‚Äôs a cool addition, so use it!

Building B‚Äôs room 304. Move out had happened by the time that this picture was taken.

# Hallway

It‚Äôs a hallway!¬†

Take a look at this video if you want to see what one is like: [https://youtu.be/VVWO-Xs5Bkg](https://youtu.be/VVWO-Xs5Bkg)¬†

# Bathrooms

One of the most important things - the bathroom. You will feel kind of awkward sharing a bathroom with 30 strangers at first, but it is cool after a while. You get used to the sounds‚Ä¶ Anyway, here are some tips:

Quick tips:

* Toilets
   * The toilets now have hangers for you to put your stuff on.¬†
   * Flush. Please.
* Showers
   * On different floors, the drains are different. Floors 4, 5, and 6 have these cool looking line drains that slant toward the wall. Floor 3 has the standard circle drains which is lame because hair clogs the drain really easily.¬†
* Within the first week, someone is going to tape the door to the bathroom open. Unless you live on an all girls floor, this is fine. Who wants to get their wallet out to swipe their key while they‚Äôre prairie doggin‚Äô it? Nobody. Tape that bitch. (Same goes for the lounge)
   * Side note - Some RAs don‚Äôt like this. Don‚Äôt get caught.
   * I hesitate to say this is cool on an all girls floor bc‚Ä¶ privacy and stuff. Idk, live your best life :D
* Handicap Stalls - If you don‚Äôt have anyone who needs it on your floor, opt to use the handicap toilet and shower - it‚Äôs so much more space and there is another shower head if you need something
   * Handicapped people need this shit more than you. If you have someone on your floor that is handicapped in any way (mentally or physically) just use another bathroom or shower, or go to another floor‚Äôs handicap stall.
* Yellow jackets get in in the fall quarter. Close the windows then, but winter and spring quarters are pretty safe.¬†

# Pictures of the bathroom:

* Take a look at this video for a walkthrough of the bathroom: [https://youtu.be/308UYSBDogc](https://youtu.be/308UYSBDogc)¬†

# Elevators

Not a jungle gym. The minute the elevator in your building goes out, you are going to be pissed at whoever made it go that way. Climbing 4 flights of stairs is good cardio, but after a long day‚Ä¶ Trust me, don‚Äôt take the elevators for granted. Also, the best way to get to the [BCycle ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit#heading=h.fs2drsh399t)dock at the halls is through the elevator.¬†

# Floor Lounges

Great for lounging in! So great in fact that it‚Äôll probably be nasty from all the parties in there.¬†

Quick tips about the floor lounge:

* This is where you will clean your dishes. Most of the time it looks like the image below, but there is a decent standard deviation. Bring your own soap, sponge, and dishrags.¬†
   * It is also a water bottle filler, but if you live in A or B building, just use the elkay one on the 2nd floor. People do weird stuff with this and sometimes it tasted weird‚Ä¶
   * I liked the dishrags from trader joes since they are a nice size and great to set stuff on to drain once you are done washing, but for drying fully, you‚Äôll probably want a dishtowel.
   * Image of the sink:
* This is where a floor vacuum will be stored. If you have the money, bring a small handheld vacuum so you can suck random junk without needing that whole thing.
* People will leave SO MANY VALUABLES in there. Shocking, but just leave it. Their stuff is cool to them, don‚Äôt take it. Certainly don‚Äôt trust their food &amp; more specifically, their drinks.
* There is a trash can in here that is taken out by the janitor, but other than that, nothing else is cleaned by the janitor. Everything is done by the residents and oftentimes the RA. Don‚Äôt be an ass
* There is furniture including but not limited to:
   * A large table
   * A small table
   * A coffee table
   * 8 chairs
   * A couch
   * 5 large half-capsule chairs
   * 2 small half-capsule chairs
   * 2 circular drink tables/foot tables
* On floor 3 of buildings A, B, and C, there is a balcony. It is locked forever since some people left furniture out in the rain one day. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
* Note that there is NO
   * Tv
   * Toaster
   * Microwave
   * Fridge
* Other pictures of the lounge: \*

# Floor Themes

Every Residential Hallway has a theme. It is meant to be a commonality so that you can join with people around you and to make new friends.¬†

Mine was ‚Äúgaming‚Äù, but there are themes like ‚Äúwriting‚Äù, and ‚Äúocean‚Äù. It isn‚Äôt any work, it is just meant to act as a commonality between new people.

[https://housing.ucsc.edu/themes/](https://housing.ucsc.edu/themes/)¬†

# Internet

There is pretty fast wifi in the dorms, but some devices (like a watch or a nintendo switch) may not work. There is more info here: [https://its.ucsc.edu/wireless/reswifi.html](https://its.ucsc.edu/wireless/reswifi.html)¬†

# Fire escape

This is what it looks like. Idk why you would need it tho. Just flee the building and go to the Acad or something.

# Laundry Room

The laundry room uses a company called CSCgo. Universally hated by UCSC students. When machines don‚Äôt work, you can submit a ticket to CSC and pray to the lord that it gets fixed in this lifetime (don‚Äôt submit a ticket to [CruzFix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/133zOGfx5sIsW1hx4PFjxD-TKMUGBWTCpgpbWgbgvvqY/edit#heading=h.nf77x3lt39sz), they can‚Äôt do squat since CSC is a contractor). The commercial washers and dryers are the best since they do the most clothes per dollar spent.¬†

There is a sink in the laundry room where you can wash off tye-dyed shirts

There is a table and chairs for you to jam at

There is a standing table for you to fold clothing at - wash it off first. It feels kind of weird folding clothes in a public area, but by the end of the year, who cares?¬†¬†

Take a look at this for a video of the laundry room: [https://youtu.be/bWJZpjLCd5Q](https://youtu.be/bWJZpjLCd5Q)¬†

# Trash Room / Dumpster

The trash room was here for a while until UCSC realized that it was a pain to roll out the trash cans every week. They opted for a dumpster. There is a dumpster for recycling and trash which often overflows.¬†

A pic of the long lost trash room:

# Building Lounges (Buildings A and B only)

Awesome and clean lounges that people often hang in. There are also private bathrooms down the hall. There are tables, couches, etc for people to jam at. Also, in building B there is a ping-pong table, so that‚Äôs cool.

These are only in buildings A and B, but all buildings can access them.

Take a look at this video (that shows a bit more than what is in the pic): [https://youtu.be/Ii24Z-jgF\_w](https://youtu.be/Ii24Z-jgF_w)¬†

# Other Suggestions about the area

* Explore! There‚Äôs cool nooks around and during that first quarter, not many people go to them which makes it perfect for studying. The I lounge? The Kresge garden? Super cool stuff
* Yellow jackets are rampant during the fall quarter, so watch out. They die down in winter and spring.
* Some of the walkways are dumb and the walkways should feel bad about themselves. There are plenty of shortcuts which allow for a quicker route.
   * Eg. In front of C building, from the front of B building to the dumpsters opposite of the staircase, behind A building over the gas pipe.¬†
* There is a ton of construction going on that probably won't be done until 2027, so just be wary. Don‚Äôt go into the site. There are wayy to many cameras.¬†
* A lot of people go on top of the Acad building. I‚Äôve never done it, but if you do, I‚Äôd suggest doing it during a power outage when the lights are off and wearing hoodies. Protecting your identity is key.
* Look at this video about the hallway between the building B lounge and the laundry room. Also, read the description! [https://youtu.be/573YI1CE5pg](https://youtu.be/573YI1CE5pg)¬†

# CruzFix - [https://ches.ucsc.edu/cruzfix/](https://ches.ucsc.edu/cruzfix/)¬†

CruzFix is the maintenance portal for the UCSC campus and can help with anything from windows to pipes to closets to doors. Make sure to submit whatever you need to do quick because there may be a line

# Example submission:

During my time in the dorms, the clothes hanger broke in my closet and I couldn‚Äôt find the screw to fix it. I took the following picture and filled out the following form:

1. Firstly, you have to find your property (Mine was ‚ÄúKresge College Residential Hall B‚Äù)
2. Choose the floor and room number (New addition to the form from last year)
   1. You also have to choose your ‚ÄúSub-space‚Äù which idk what that is. I‚Äôm guessing the orange slip you get with your Student ID in it at the beginning of the year has that on it
3. Choose the type of thing you needed fixing (Mine was ‚ÄúHousing - Closet‚Äù)
4. Choose the sub-type aka what needs fixing in the furniture (Mine was ‚ÄúHanger bar fell / Is loose‚Äù)
5. In the ‚Äúdescribe your request‚Äù box, my building and room number, then I put that the closet is the one under the loft. Give them as much information as they need to fix your stuff.
6. Add your contact information
7. After you submit, you can attach a photo, which is where I attached the above.
8. Wait for them to fix your stuff. For this particular job, they did it while I was gone, so it was kind of weird having that done.

# BCycle

There are BCycle stations all over campus and are pretty competitive. So is the license for it, so I suggest you get on it ASAP (or at least after I get mine). The school subsidizes it, so it comes out to $16/yr versus the $200/yr you would otherwise pay.¬†

Or you could ride the bus.

# Meals

# What meal plan should I get?

Unless you plan to eat 3 meals a day every day, DON'T get the Banana slug point plan. By the end of my first quarter I had 550 extra points I needed to spend by the end of the quarter since you lose it at the end. Porter market was ransacked that day, and there was nothing left but a long-ass receipt. Take it from me - get the blue or gold. You can supplement with [Banana bucks (since they are great for the dining halls)](https://dining.ucsc.edu/res-hall-meal-plans/index.html#:~:text=Yes%2C%20if%20your%20Slug,quarter%20(June%2016%2C%202025).) and they will act as slug points if you eat through your points.¬†

1g9zzrz,UCSC,east remote and the parking situation,"this has gotten so fucking ridiculous at this point. let‚Äôs start with that on literally a monday morning at 3:30am, every single spot in west remote is filled. i lived in oakes for 2 years and never in my LIFE has it been like that. it was crazy. even on weekdays past five you could park in there no problem, and now there‚Äôs absolutely nothing. i used to stroll in last year over there at 11am on a monday and there was multiple open spots.

now let‚Äôs move onto fucking east remote parking. how is it what WEEK 4 and there was still not a single fucking spot at 10:45am. there was like 15-20 other cars circling the whole lot and i don‚Äôt think many of them even found parking. i ended up driving around there between there and west remote for a whole hour, before i decided to just leave at 11:40- which was when my class started. while there is the ‚Äúextra‚Äù parking down at the farm at the base of campus, every single bus coming to campus is either extremely late or full, and there was 40+ people standing at the base of campus stop. that was just at that stop the rest of the stops and the east remote stops were so much worse. at that point it was 11:40 and there was no bus in sight and it felt stupid to stand there for 40 minutes take the bus for 20 minutes onto campus, walk 5 to my class and then go back. it was only an hour and a half class anyways. how fucking stupid is ucsc.??? how does this benefit anyone‚Äôs education?? you‚Äôre actively prohibiting students to be able to show up to classes because they can‚Äôt park just anywhere and if they do then they get a ticket but can‚Äôt park anywhere off campus that‚Äôs a ticket too but you could take the bus, even if you live 5 minutes away it will probably take an hour üòãüòã LIKE HELLO??? mind you i live 20-25 mins away w traffic, so for a bus that‚Äôs like an hour and a half, you have to switch busses and then when you get near campus oh my god shit show. 

i pay for a parking pass and everytime i have been on campus to go to class i haven‚Äôt been to find parking. i work before class, and i even left work earlier today so i could try to get a spot. it makes me so genuinely mad because i was so excited for my classes this quarter and it‚Äôs just been harder and harder for me to be able to even go to fucking class at this point. why the fuck am i paying this fuck ass ridiculous school thousands of dollars for an education i‚Äôm not even getting. like what can we do as students even do??",-0.93,Finance

I've always thought about telling the artist how much their work meant to me, but I never remembered to write down their name, and their signature is completely illegible to me.

1dcualz,UCSC,Frustrated about the strikes,"I started at this school in fall 2018. Meaning in 2020, I saw the campus shut down by the COLA strikes in the months preceding COVID. This quarter was my first back since taking a LOA after spring 2022. I live in SF now and commute down half the week for class via public transportation. It takes a long time. 

You can imagine my frustration by being inconvenienced by the strikes. With campus shut down, there‚Äôs no reason for me to go to SC, and I feel very disconnected from my education and unmotivated as my working and social life resumes in SF. 

However, my frustration in this regard is minimal when compared with my disgust and outrage against the thousands of children being shot, bulldozed, and burnt to crisps in perhaps the most-publicized (in America) ethnic cleansing of the modern day, all by a nation with the full and unmitigated financial and military support of the United States, all to take out some hundreds of freedom fighters. Furthermore, I am angry at the UC regents and the boards at the individual colleges for refusing to divest their own financial support towards the economy of said genocidal nation. Historically, this to me is comparable to having investment holdings in apartheid South Africa ‚Äî despicable. Yet the regents choose to paint those who would call for divestment as the problem, prolonging this conflict with staff and students to drive them to more and more extreme means of protest in order to further demonize them. They refuse to acknowledge that they have the power to end the protests at any time simply by divesting from a genocide. 

I am, more than the protests inconveniencing me personally, frustrated at how the greater UCSC community seems all too eager to villainize and throw their fellow students under the bus instead of applying that same pressure to the boards and regents, who alone have the power to meet the protestors‚Äô very simple demands. 

The UC Regents have never had the best interests of you ‚Äî the student, TA, or teacher ‚Äî in mind. They operate on a profit motive and to actualize their vision of a liberal academic institution, one that clearly holds space for the mass slaughter of thousands of innocents under circumstances that they passively and actively deem acceptable by refusing the calls for divestment. They have never, and will never, act in your interests without a public display like what we‚Äôve seen this quarter. Are protestors supposed to ask nicely for the Lord Regents in their far off towers, the ‚Äúfaces‚Äù of the institutions that WE embody and carry with us in our daily lives, to make a stance against genocide, both through public decree and financial practice, and just smile and say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay!‚Äù when they refuse? No worries if not? Fuck that. They don‚Äôt bend unless you apply pressure. They refused at every opportunity and instead spent thousands if not a million dollars on police presence (if the numbers are similar to Winter 2020) to DOUBLE DOWN on their stance. 

We should all hold emotional space for our own frustrations, inconveniences, complaints, losses. No matter how trivial, they are a part of us and deserve to be felt in their fullest. However, in this case, they pale in comparison to the grief, the death, the hunger and pain being inflicted on the Palestinian people by forces armed by our government, eating food and buying phones or whatever the fuck from companies invested in by OUR school! And there are no means of forcing divestment except for ongoing public displays of resistance and pressure on the institution itself. 

I know your tuition is valuable. I know your education is taking a hit. I know the some of the protestors disrupting class and shouting holier-than-thou rhetoric at you for simply trying to succeed in your classes is frustrating. Your mental health, sense of stability, all that, and I feel it too. It fucking sucks. But I still believe that enduring this frustration may, in some small way, lead to the easing of the frustration and suffering of those who are getting wiped from the face of the Earth right now. It the UC divests from Israeli businesses the economic impact may be little, but as one of the world‚Äôs leading public education systems, and a defining force in liberal academia, the echoes of this refusal of support WILL ripple throughout the world and help to spur on the fight for justice. We can only pray that it comes before it is too late.",-0.85,Politics
1d38rht,UCSC,A Message From Graduate Students Speaking Out About the Protests,"Myself and graduate students from UCSC and other UCs have been troubled by the recent protests and decided to draft this letter on our thoughts:

We express understanding that honest convictions in social matters can properly be pursued through pressuring the UC administration but urge that decisions of administration should in the meantime be peacefully obeyed.

Responsible students have undertaken to work on various social problems which cause friction and unrest at UCSC and other campuses. At UCSC, recent public events have given indication that we all have opportunity for a new constructive and realistic approach to these social problems.

However, we are now confronted by a series of demonstrations by some of our students, directed and led in part by outsiders. We recognize the natural impatience of people who feel that their hopes are slow in being realized. But we are convinced that these demonstrations are unwise and untimely.

We agree with certain local student groups which have called for honest and open negotiation of social issues in our university. And we believe this kind of facing of issues can best be accomplished by students and members of the administration meeting with their knowledge and experience of the situation. All of us need to face that responsibility and find proper channels for its accomplishment.

We point out that hatred and violence have no sanction in our educational traditions and we also point out that such actions as incite to hatred and violence, however technically peaceful those actions may be, have not contributed to the resolution of our local problems. We do not believe that these extreme measures are justified at UCSC.

We commend the community as a whole, and the local news media and law enforcement officials in particular, on the calm manner in which these demonstrations have been handled. We urge students to continue to show restraint should the demonstrations continue, and the law enforcement officials to remain calm and continue to protect our University from violence.

We further strongly urge our own student community to withdraw support from these demonstrations, and to unite locally in working peacefully for a better UCSC.¬† When rights are consistently denied, a cause should be pressed through discussions with UC administration, and not in the streets. We appeal to students of all political backgrounds to observe the principles of law and order and common sense.

We would also like to point out that we aren't alone in our options, as over 60% of the American public believes these protests do more harm than good.

Thank you.

This Monday, May 20th, UC Santa Cruz will STAND UP!

On Monday, all Santa Cruz UAW 4811 academic workers should stop all teaching and wind down research work. This is essential to showing UC that academic workers are united in our commitment to stopping the University‚Äôs serious unfair labor practices, which have included:

Actively risking the health and safety of UAW 4811 members and members of the university community by allowing violent attacks by agitators and police on peaceful protesters who bravely chose to speak up as employee members of the University‚Äôs Academic community and by creating an unsafe work environment;

Making unilateral changes to working conditions that have impacted our teaching, our work obligations, our safety and our academic freedom;

Summoning the police to forcibly eject and arrest UAW 4811 members in retaliation for engaging in peaceful protest activity demanding workplace-related changes; causing a chilling effect on future concerted actions by our union and its members, and more. They‚Äôve also threatened our members with discipline and loss of employee benefits.

If you are a UC Santa Cruz worker, see you on the picket line! And for everyone else across the state, stand by and prepare to Stand Up when your campus is called!

May 16, 2024
Dear Campus Community,

Our campus has a long history of effectively balancing our mission of teaching, learning, and conducting research with the rights of free expression as seen through rallies, marches, and other demonstrations. All these activities can and do occur regularly at UC Santa Cruz.

We share in the profound grief and concern for the individuals and families who are being impacted by the staggering loss of life in Gaza and by the fate of the hostages still being held by Hamas. There is immense suffering by children, families, and other civilians. We continue to express our grief for the victims of violence and displacement. We also understand that many in our community feel a deep need to do all that they can, in their own spheres of influence, to halt that violence. We respect that intention. We are, however, a large and diverse community, and we have obligations to our fellow community members and the responsibility to support the rights of everyone in our community to access all aspects of their work and education.

On May 1, a group of students created an unlawful tent encampment in Quarry Plaza. Our response has been to prioritize and support the safety of the students in the encampment and everyone else in our campus community. The campus fire marshal inspects the encampment area daily, and we have appreciated that the student demonstrators have acted to address some of the safety concerns, such as keeping staircases unobstructed.

Still, the existence of the encampment is a violation of law and university policy, has ongoing safety hazards, and has impacted our community in various ways. Our campus store has been forced to close as well as several campus food options, our resource centers are providing services from alternate locations, and a number of events have been postponed or canceled, much to the disappointment of both organizers and those planning to attend. A number of employees and others who work on campus have had their work schedules disrupted. Last week, we also experienced three dining hall disruptions. Disrupting dining halls prevents students who rely on meal plans from accessing food, an outcome that is the opposite of the action's stated goals, but the actual outcome nonetheless. These disruptions reflect a lack of respect, even if unintentional, for many in the community who are trying to do their job and simply trying to serve the campus community.

Campus leaders met with students from the encampment throughout last week to see if we could reach a mutually agreeable resolution that would include the voluntary disbanding of the encampment. We were largely quiet during that time, mostly posting safety updates on the status website to respect the intentionality and earnestness of those discussions. We remained optimistic throughout those discussions. Unfortunately, student representatives rejected the proposal that campus leadership put forward Friday, then posted on social media that our discussions were over. We remain ready to resume our dialogue with student representatives, and the ideas that we put forth remain on the table. We have communicated that with the student representatives. We believe the student representatives saw in our discussions last week that our approach was both earnest and in good faith.

Yesterday, our campus community faced additional disruption. Students blocked Hagar Drive throughout the afternoon and evening, while another group disrupted several classes. These actions are not protected speech and violate the student code of conduct. This escalation of disruption was unprompted by any action by campus administration. The continued presence of the unlawful encampment itself is causing unease for many in our community, because of the loss of access to campus resources and the messaging that has been displayed or chanted at the Quarry Plaza encampment.

We continue to call for the unlawful encampment to voluntarily disband.

We are ardent defenders of free speech and of the right of our community members to express themselves within the rights and protections of the First Amendment. As an academic institution, we encourage and depend on the robust exchange of ideas. We also strive to maintain a campus environment that is welcoming, open, civil, and mutually respectful of everyone and their views. This means speaking out against speech that deeply harms our community. This balance‚Äìand responsibility‚Äìis something all of us must take seriously. Over the past two weeks, we have seen appalling antisemitic and anti-Israeli messages and graffiti at or near the encampment. These expressions of hate, like all expressions of hate, are despicable, damaging, and have no place in our community. Our campus has a webpage with support and reporting resources for students and employees.

Our campus is special because of the remarkable students, faculty, and staff who make up our community. It is a place of learning and robust discussion. As a publicly funded university, it is also a place of laws, rules, and policies that govern the education that our students receive and the work we do. We expect everyone to uphold their responsibilities as members of this community.

Sincerely,

Cindy and Lori

The response was really positive and enough for me to move forward with plans!! If you have any specific items you could envision yourself taking a bat or sledgehammer to, please drop comments below! I have put together an idea of how I will tier price packages but have yet to come up with prices themselves. I‚Äôm interested in coming up with plans/packages for participants to see how their confidence levels/depression/overall self esteem shift over time but also want to offer one time ragers an opportunity to get out frustrations as well. To see growth in confidence levels, research has availed to me a timeline of 150 days is a good amount of time to compare from a starting point. With that being said:

‚Ä¢ 1X - single-time ragers (would be the most exp compared to the plans below) 

‚Ä¢ 1X a month for 5 months or 2 quarters

‚Ä¢ 2X a month for 5 months or 2 quarters

‚Ä¢ 3X a month for 5 months or 2 quarters 

‚Ä¢ 1X/week for 5 months or 2 quarters (best price per rage session)

If support remains positive, I will start to reach out to restaurants and stores to purchase produce at a discount that they plan on throwing away so you all can get smashing!

I took AM3 with Jackson this fall. I had a 94 point something in the class and I thought I wasn't doing too bad. A lot of people probably had a lower grade than me at this point. I knew I would have to study like a dog for the final, and hey maybe I didn't study enough. but I TRIED at least. It's the day of the final (yesterday). It was a 3 hour long test and I knew i was fucked. But I thought maybe I would get like a 60 or high 50 at worst. 

The grades got put in the same day. I check my final grade and it went from a 94% to a 79%. What the fuck bruh. Check my final grade. OH

The class average was 36% on that fucking final. 36 points out of 100. The highest score anyone got was an 84%. I got 30/100. 

It sounds ridiculous. I literally took precalc in high school and it wasn't my best subject ever but I got a steady B+ in the class. 

I know it's a GE/prerequisite class and everything (which is why I'm taking it, for my psych major), but 36% average in precalculus is absolutely ridiculous.

What do I do at this point? I am very opposed to the idea of getting a C in this class. The professor has to curve it right? This has probably put many people at risk of failing the class.

1fn8hcz,UCSC,UCSC Bus Guide,"&gt;**SUMMER 2025 Updates**  
(Metro has scaled back their operations due to bus degradation since Winter 2025, and it's unclear when full service will return. Someone tell them to bring back 90X...)  
\- Metro hasn't announced their Fall 2025 schedule yet. I'll update this guide when that happens.  
\- Many bus routes have lower frequencies, especially after 9 pm  
\- TAPS is trying out a new bus tracking system. They had it in the Flexigo app in the Spring, but they may be moving it elsewhere (hopefully to transit apps people actually use?)

Google Maps (and/or the Transit app) can get you to pretty much anywhere you want to go. They both pull from the same data source, so you probably don't need one if you already have the other - however, I find Google Maps has more accurate ETAs, since they do their own predictions. There is also [https://rt.scmetro.org/](https://rt.scmetro.org/), which is run by Santa Cruz Metro, so you can trust it has real buses (see the end of this post for more about ""Scheduled"" buses).

# Current Bus Lines

These can change on a quarterly basis, so if it's Fall 2025 or later, this may be out of date. For example, last summer the 3A/3B to UCSC got replaced with 11, and some stops were moved around.

* **UCSC BUSES** \- be courteous to off-campus commuters and use these when travelling around campus! Free for everyone, including non-students. Gets very crowded during peak school hours. Only Night Upper Campus runs on weekends, so use Metro buses when they're not available. [More detailed schedules here](https://taps.ucsc.edu/buses-shuttles/campus-shuttles.html)
   * LOOP \[7a-9p M-F\] - makes a loop around campus
   * UPPER CAMPUS \[7a-9p M-F\] - goes from west remote to east remote; essentially the same route but doesn't go all the way around
   * NIGHT UPPER CAMPUS \[8p-12a M-Th, 6p-12a F, 4:30p-12a Sa/Su\] - same as upper campus, but at night and weekend afternoons
   * SCIENCE HILL LIMITED (SHL, possibly called Upper Campus Limited now?) - Runs at fixed times throughout the day, from the remote parking lots to Science Hill, bypassing many stops. Check the Flexigo app for more information.
* **SANTA CRUZ METRO** \- free when you show your Student ID to the driver. **""West Gate""** routes enter by Oakes and goes üîÅ **clockwise** , while **""Main Gate""** routes enter at the base of campus and goes üîÑÔ∏è **counterclockwise**.
   * **11 (West Gate - High)** \- Goes straight down High Street, across Hwy 1 and straight to downtown. It's the fastest way to get downtown, except during rush hour (mid-afternoon) where it gets *unbearably slow*. Check your transit app if you're unsure.
   * **19 (West Gate - Bay)** \- Goes down Bay St, to the Wharf, and then back up to Downtown.
   * **18 (Main Gate - Mission)** \- The most popular and most frequently run bus route. Goes down Western Drive to Mission St, then to Downtown.
   * **20 (Main Gate - Delaware)** \- Goes down Western Dr like the 18, but then keeps going down to the Coastal Campus. Then, backtracks to Delaware Ave, passes by the Wharf, and then goes back up to Downtown.

# How do I get to...?

From campus. Trip times may vary from where you start at, and may be longer during peak times.

* **Trader Joes / Downtown**: Take any Metro bus line. It doesn't matter. You'll be dropped off in the Trader Joes shopping center - just walk through the parking lot, since the entrance is on the other side. The trip takes about 30 minutes.
* **Safeway**: Take the 18, and get off at *Mission &amp; Miramar Dr (Almar Shopping Ctr)*. The trip takes about 15 minutes.
* **Target**: Take any bus to the Metro Center and then take the 2 or 3A/3B. The 2 is faster. The trip takes about an hour.
* **The Boardwalk / Wharf**: Take the 19 and get off at *Pacific Ave &amp; Front (Wharf)*. Then, just walk down the beach to the boardwalk. The trip takes about 30 minutes.
* **Coastal Campus**: Take the 20. The trip takes about 20 minutes.
* **Costco**: Get someone with a car. If you're going to Costco, I doubt you'll be getting things you can just carry with you on a bus. There is a route involving the 4 bus, but it only runs hourly and is almost never worth it (Google almost always suggests *walking 30 minutes from the 11 bus stop over transferring*). Though, admittedly the bike path along Hwy 1 is very nice!
* **San Jose Diridon Station**: Take any bus to the Metro Center and then take the Highway 17 Express ($7). The trip takes about 1h 30m.
* **Salinas**: Take any bus to the Metro Center and then take the 90X (or 1 or 2). You do not have to pay an additional fee to use the 90X, even though it is an ""express"" route. Then, ask for a transfer to the 28/29 and take whichever comes first. They both go to Salinas - from there, you can go to Monterey or take the Coast Starlight down to LA. The trip takes about 2h 30m.

# Transit Center

The Metro center is going through renovations, so the new ""Riverfront Transit Center"" stops around the Trader Joes shopping center. This makes things very confusing for transfers - refer to [this map](https://scmtd.com/en/riders-guide/transit-centers):

https://preview.redd.it/p7guu0mq8gqd1.png?width=5333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7409912205c94f7e9274d2bb75008cab7e5d4119

This probably does not help much. Basically, **all UCSC buses drop off at the west side (3) and pick up on the east side (1).** The Highway 17 express stop moved from last year and now picks up north (4) of the UCSC bus drop off - by Woodstock's Pizza.

# Highway 17 Express

The **Highway 17 Express** departs from the Metro Center and goes to San Jose Diridon station. Tickets are $7 one way, and you can buy them in the Santa Cruz Metro app or pay with cash. You can also buy a day pass for $14, which allows unlimited rides. The bus ride is about 1 hour each way.

# Bus etiquette

* Have your student ID ready before boarding. Wait to the side to let everyone off before you board.
* **If you're standing, move to the back of the bus when you get on or when others get off** to let more people get on. (The bus driver will probably yell this at you if you don't.)
* As of 2025, you are allowed to board the bus using the front *or* the back bus doors **on campus only**.
* Offer seats at the front of the bus to people who may need them - elderly / handicap / etc. (This may seem obvious, but a lot of people don't do it :( )
* If you have a big backpack and it's crowded, take it off and put it between your legs so that more people can fit into the bus.
* Say thank you to the driver when you exit!

# Some other tips

* Pay attention - some colleges only have bus stops in one direction. For example, Crown only has a Main Gate bus stop (counterclockwise).
* If you're getting around campus, consider using the [BCycle ](https://taps.ucsc.edu/bike-programs/bike-share.html)e-bike share - or just walk there! It's usually faster than waiting for a bus, and you get to admire the pretty campus :\^)
   * If you live off campus and are trying to get out, it's also usually easier to walk to the last Metro stop on campus (e.g. Porter or Bookstore) and take the bus from there. Since a lot of people use the Metro buses to get around campus, you'll save yourself from being packed into a crowded bus - or just being passed by altogether.
* If you're transferring to another bus system (VTA buses in San Jose or MST buses in Watsonville), ask the driver for a transfer when you exit! They'll give you a card that lets you ride your transfer bus for free.
* **Don't rely on ""Scheduled"" buses. They're almost always wrong.**
   * This problem has mostly been fixed, but if a bus says ""Scheduled"" in Google Maps or it doesn't have a blinking icon next to the time in Transit, it's not being tracked, and is most likely inaccurate (sometimes by 5 minutes, sometimes by 45!). Don't get frustrated by a bus that doesn't exist!
   * Buses on the map of [https://rt.scmetro.org/](https://rt.scmetro.org/) are being tracked in real time, and you can trust the arrival time estimates it gives when you click on a stop. If all else fails, try this.
   * UCSC buses (Loop, Upper Campus, etc) are never tracked. They're working on it, though - a solution may be out by fall quarter.

1fgcqq3,UCSC,My parents are stealing my financial aid,"I‚Äôm a a returning off campus student here at UCSC and i receive a financial aid refund from the school. It covers tuition then i get an amount to help cover my rent, utilities, and any other costs. For context, my parents are extremely traditional, they don‚Äôt believe in the concept of ‚Äúhaving your own money‚Äù in a family. I‚Äôve never been allowed to have a job for this idiotic reason. It is honestly just a way for them to keep me dependent on them and limits my independence even though i‚Äôm over 18. My financial aid refund is linked to their bank account through direct deposit. This is usually fine with me because they would use it to pay my rent because my aid covers it. However recently, my computer has been broken. I haven‚Äôt had a new one in many years and I use it for school. My parents recently told me that they forbid me from using my financial aid to help pay for my new computer. They believe that me using the money is selfish and that I would only use it to fool around and play games or whatever. Clearly a deluded excuse in order for me to not be able to use it. The problem is that after the financial aid is deposited in their bank account, i never see it again. They use it to pay for my rent but the remaining amount i never see again and they spend it on god knows what. This is frustrating for me because firstly they are acting like it is their money when in reality, it is rightfully MY financial aid money that was given to me. Secondly, who are they to ‚Äúforbid‚Äù me from not only buying a computer, but also telling me what i can or cannot buy with my OWN financial aid money?

1d88v1m,UCSC,Math 16A/B... sign up please :),"Dear UCSC students, especially entering frosh,

I rarely post here on Reddit, but I wanted to reach people about new math classes.  These classes are Math 16A/B, and they are meant as alternatives to traditional calculus (11A/B and 19A/B) built from the ground up for Biology Majors.  This means that yes... you can take Math 16A/B instead of Math 11A/B if you're majoring in EEB, MCDB, etc.  Talk to the advisors for specifics, but I worked very hard with my science colleagues to make sure that the classes satisfy the requirements across our biology majors.

  
I'm very excited to teach the class this summer and fall.  Specifically, I'm teaching Math 16A during the second summer session in August, and then teaching Math 16A again in Fall.  Then I'll teach Math 16B in Winter to finish the sequence.  My math department colleagues will pick up Math 16A again in winter, etc. too.  The prereqs for Math 16A are the same as Math 11A -- you just have to sign up for the class that fits best for you.

What makes Math 16A exciting (to me)?

1.  I really like the life sciences and have worked closely with biologists, so I'm excited to build a course with biology at the center.

2.  I think that mathematical modeling -- the art of describing the natural world with numbers and variables -- is extremely valuable, and often lost in a haze of math rules and symbol juggling.  I'm excited to teach a course primarily on the modeling aspects of math.

3.  The motivation for this class came from an extraordinary class taught at UCLA, [called LS30A/B](https://www.lscore.ucla.edu/ls-20-30a-30b-40-faqs/).  Not only is this taught to thousands of students, but [the students do very well in follow-up courses in chemistry and physics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8840928/), they get into med schools, etc.  The success at UCLA has inspired at least a dozen other universities to design classes like LS30 and our new Math 16A -- [we are all meeting with each other in a national effort](https://www.math.harvard.edu/event/2024-master-class-in-teaching-math-modeling-for-life-sciences/), and I'm excited to be part of that effort.  

4.  I like the energy of teaching students who are just arriving at UCSC.

tl;dr:  If you're pursuing a bio-related major, please sign up for my Math 16A courses in Summer Session 2 or Fall 2024.  Help get the word out.  

Any questions?  Ask here or send me an email at weissman AT ucsc DOT edu.

1fympmn,UCSC,Rant and possible opinion,"So I'm going to try to keep this anonymous as much as possible because I'm genuinely afraid of this person. So for the rest of this story I'm going to name them Ellie. 

Where to start, so I met Ellie way back then (again can't say dates cuz I'm scared) in high-school. She was my first girlfriend and at first I was stoked because she was basically my first everything but it didn't take long to go sour. Firstly we kinda broke up because I was ""too nice"" and then came back together which then she cheated on me emotionally. It was disturbed for a bit but we made it through and I thought well we made it through this far so we're solid. But the thing was her cheating on me made her very insecure. Because any friend I had she thought I was cheating as a way to get back at her. So eventually I lost many of my friends cuz of that. And that just persisted for month where Ellie was the only person I talked to. But then one day I remember I was coming from work and I just wanted to talk about how tired I was because I was lugging around boxes for 8 hours. And the only thing she said was ""you shouldn't be complaining you're a man, women go through much worse"". Not wanting to argue I just shut my phone off and went to bed. The next day though she picked right up and it started a really bad argument where she used the fact that I myself am a victim of r*** and doubled down saying ""you should understand what women go through everyday because of what happened to you"". 

That moment broke me, I never ever felt anger like that. Using something so sensitive to win an argument that I didn't even spark. I choked on my words because what I wanted to say was so full of rage that it took everything I had not to blow up.  At that point I broke up with her but something about her breaking down and sobbing just struck me because I genuinely did care so I just said give me space. 

At that time I came to ucsc, and I felt free because I was away from home to deal with this. But it didn't stop for months she'd guilt trip me to the point where she'd say if we didn't make amends or if I stopped talking to her she'd kill herself. So even away I felt trapped. And I don't know if it was her but I got death threats from spam ig accounts where police were involved.

And then there was some back and forth, some toxic friends with benefits. I really blame myself for entertaining that. And then at some point she started to move on with someone older so I was like ok so I guess this is it, for what it's worth, I'm sorry for my part in the mess we had because I also take some blame for it. But it didn't stop there, instead of letting go she held on and said that even though she was talking to someone else she'd end herself if I left. Then comes the next year where she bashed me everyday saying that the other person was better and even when I said ok lemme go then she'd say she'd end herself. 

For months that continued until she finally let me go not before bragging about hooking up with the new guy. So then I was like ok it's over I can heal. But it wasn't she ousted to my friends that I was an example of toxic masculinity just for the sole fact that I use the gym to vent. And all my friends just ditched me. And then her, her family, and even her new bf started stalking me. Playing whack-a-mole where the moment I spot them on ig they'd block me so it was like they could stalk me whenever they wanted to. 

This is the kicker and the main deal. She followed me all the way to ucsc. So now it was like I didn't feel safe at home or in santa cruz. Sometimes I'd see her on my way to anywhere on campus and I'd have to take detours because I'd genuinely freeze and begin to freak out. And when I started therapy I realized the reason that is, is because she also ass***lted me in the back of an Uber once and because of my prior trauma I just blocked that out and my therapist told me that because of everything she has done I'm classified as a victim of DV and can take this to provost.

Now this this the opinion part. What should I do? It's been a long time since I spoke to her so should I even bother bringing this up? And at the same time I feel immense blame towards myself. Because I just think why the fuck did I stay for so long? And I feel ashamed that not only was I a victim once but twice. So any reassurance or advice would sincerely help. I just need to vent on the down low because not only am I afraid of her retaliating but I'm scared of the people in my life judging me for letting someone do all this to me.",-0.83,Mental Health

1g15g98,UCSC,Threat of Deportation,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice on a really distressing situation that I was involved in recently. I'm keeping all names anonymous for privacy reasons.

On Monday, September 30th, between 7:00 and 8:00 pm, I witnessed a hate event at an off-campus UCR housing. I was staying at my girlfriend's place after returning from a conference in Canada. The housemate I'm talking about is a UCR undergrad with a Silicon Valley (rich) dad. I am a UCSC student and happened to be there during my trip back from Canada.

I came downstairs after hearing a heated argument between my girlfriend and her housemate. The housemate, who had previously made derogatory comments about international students, was aggressively demanding his deposit back. He threatened my girlfriend multiple times, saying he would do 'bad things' if she didn't comply. **He specifically mentioned calling the police and having her deported, knowing full well that she is on an F1 visa. He even threatened to damage her online reputation, which would make it difficult for her to find future tenants.**

He escalated things by throwing some of her houseplants into the sink, claiming he had the right to do so as a housemate. He then demanded that I leave immediately, saying he didn't want any guests in the house. **When I tried to step in, he turned on me, making derogatory remarks about international graduate students being ""poor"" and not deserving to cause him trouble.**

After he left, we realized he had locked both restrooms from the inside and thrown away some of her posters from the common areas. This made both of us feel extremely unsafe, and I decided to stay for two more days out of concern for her safety.

The next day, while my girlfriend was at UCR, the housemate came back and threatened me again, demanding that I leave and threatening to call the police. I tried to avoid engaging with him, but it only made him more aggressive. He ended up vandalizing the Wi-Fi connection, the TV, and even spilled juice all over the kitchen. This continuous aggressive behavior has caused a lot of mental distress to my girlfriend and myself. Yesterday, he actually brought in the police in the middle of the night. His father has also started sending texts from multiple numbers, threatening deportation.

I really need some advice on how to deal with this situation, especially since the housemate is using his father's influence and seems to think he's untouchable. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading.

I already have a therapist (no thanks to their referral), but she's experiencing something personal and important, so I just needed to talk to someone. I scheduled an appointment with CAPS and basically, they didn't do anything. It seems like her entire job was to make sure I wasn't going to kill myself, then make me go away if she didn't have to call the cops. 

I'm dealing with a lot of grief right now and just a ton of stress, so I thought I could talk to someone about it. It was basically worse than not scheduling at all. Even if it was a ""consult,"" I did 30 minutes of paperwork for her to just say ""that sucks"" basically and itemize my issues without letting me talk about them, before she just told me to call my therapist and ended the appointment. (To her credit, she gave me a time next week in case my therapist didn't respond, but like... I had to talk to someone *now*.)

I was just wondering if this was a normal experience. They were always not great when I was a student a couple years ago, but now it's like they literally don't even do counseling? That was one of my ""6 free"" appointments this year I think, and she was less responsive than even a regular, non-doctor stranger would be. It kind of made me feel like a checklist because I had literally already done a checklist and all she did was check a box to not 5150 me. Egh.

Second person I asked for proof, but they declined since scammers like to ask for proof then send the proof to someone else. I instead asked questions about when commencement takes place. They replied 10am. Scammers detected. 
The third person sent a screenshot of the commencement email, blocking out their email and cropping out the time. That was sus so I asked questions about when and where commencement was taking place. They answered correctly and got upset that I was accusing them of scamming me. I ended up sending the money, but never got the tickets.

Scammers are getting more and more convincing and I'm not sure where else to try to get extra tickets. All I want is just for my entire family to be able to watch me walk across the stage. Any tips on how to verify if people actually have tickets to offer?

1fnd5pm,UCSC,"LONG RANT: what's up with half of the ""offices"" on campus having such irregular schedules?","TL,DR: I get UCSC has understaffing issues but why the hell are work hours for such important points on campus like 2 hours a day? the mailroom, cowell health center, registrar, TAPS... these places are literally the most mundane and dead jobs on earth you literally HAVE TO DO NOTHING to get paid lol, no qualifications whatsoever, why is it then that these places also have such inconsistent or short work hours? the lady at TAPS was literally watching The Mentalist LOL(I love patrick jane but come on)

this post is a bit delayed but i had a big issue with my parking permit purchase for fall(remote lot permit) and after scouring the TAPS and ucsc websites i had to go in person before they told me that i had to finish paying the previous permit first. it sounded obvious but I couldn't find any information on it on the website at least, no big deal I decided I would just try to pay it off now.

i didn't do it immediately since UCSC's billing system is ass and they once they add a charge/invoice they can't remove it for some reason and they had previously INCORRECTLY charged me out of state tuition and I was waiting for them to fix it(i didn't think it was a good idea to just pay off out of state tuition out of pocket even if they said i would get it back within the week since it was emergency)

1) The TAPS office tells me I can't pay them directly and I have to go to the registrar. I run to the registrar and they tell me the TAPS office filed the charges late(after tuition) so with the way the ebill system works I had to pay off the earlier charges FIRST before I could pay the parking fee. WTF??? 

2) I then run back to TAPS and tell them this and yep, they tell me I can't do that because they filed it late because of some ""error""(why the hell didn't they tell me this before lol), but they then tell me the REGISTRAR can directly accept payment regardless and update the ebill. again, WTF?? 

3) i run BACK to the damn registrar and suddenly they are closed... at 2 in the fucking afternoon lol WHAT???? i wait for a bit and i finally see someone come out and explain my situation, and they tell me its cash only. just my bad luck i had 24 bucks on me instead of $346.21. 

4) I end up just sucking it up and going home. I ended up paying the fees at once from my savings and also a quick 0% interest loan from my friend(since my aid doesn't cover the out of state portion), they said they would wire the incorrect charges back to me by the next week.

that stopped me from going home for a week after since i needed to replace 2 brake pads that cost me $150+ each and my account was fucking empty.

The filing also notes that UAW members, or at least individuals operating under apparent authorization from UAW ‚Äî have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activities under the guise of a st1k3. For example, individuals claiming to represent UAW hit a police officer over the head with a UAW sign, occupied an important academic building at UCLA, attempted to barricade its entrances, and left graffiti inside the building when they were finally dispersed. A few days later, individuals carrying UAW picket signs at UCLA unlawfully blocked roadways, forcing drivers to weave through people to escape the blockage.¬† The same conduct has occurred at UC Santa Cruz, with UAW picketers and protesters blocking both entrances to UC Santa Cruz‚Äôs campus.¬†

On May 23, the PERB issued a complaint against Union for illegal str$k3. The issuance of the complaint means that PERB investigated the charge and found enough evidence to suggest that a violation may have occurred, and further examination is warranted.

1grf09n,UCSC,AFSCME Strike Email,"Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor
November 14, 2024 
Dear Campus Community,
 
The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Union (AFSCME)‚Äîwhich represents University of California employees who work in patient care, dining, custodial, transportation and other service areas‚Äîhas announced it will hold a systemwide labor strike Nov. 20-21 at all UC campuses and medical centers.

The strike will include both the Patient Care Technical Unit (EX) and the Service Unit (SX). Additionally, University Professional and Technical Employees (UPTE) has announced it will hold a strike at UCSF during the same time period. 

We anticipate the strike will have noticeable impacts to the services provided by campus dining, transit, and health services. Up-to-date information for the campus community will be published on the UC Santa Cruz website at ucsc.edu/status.  

We will be focusing our efforts on instructional and operational continuity, to fulfill our mission of teaching, research, and public service. In preparation for the upcoming labor strike, I want to share some important information and resources that I hope will be helpful. 

Highlights
Focusing on instructional and operational continuity
UCSC supports protected free speech activities
Blocking access roads harms members of the campus community
Focusing on instructional and operational continuity
The Academic Senate provided guidance on instructional flexibility, given the anticipated impacts to campus services, including transportation and dining. Students are encouraged to watch for any updates from their instructors. 

Though we do not know precisely how these strike activities might impact the operation of the residential campus, we are working to do everything we can to ensure continued operations. The campus community should anticipate the following:  
Transportation and Parking: 
Transportation delays should be expected because our Campus Transit drivers are represented by AFSCME. Our limited number of management personnel will be providing Campus Transit services to the extent possible. 
During strike activity, METRO buses may choose not to access the residential campus. We anticipate buses will drop riders off at the Barn Theater, where riders may be able to board shuttles nearby, bike, or walk to access the campus core. We highly recommend that everyone carefully plan their trips onto and off campus and give themselves plenty of time to reach their destinations.
Transportation &amp; Parking Services (TAPS) Transit Operations will give highest priority to providing Disability Van Service (DVS) clients transport between on-campus locations while suspending the Bike Shuttle, Westside Connector, Silicon Valley Connector as well as most campus circulator services.
Parking permit requirements will remain in place during strike activities. Reduced transportation options may result in an increased demand for parking on the residential campus. Parkmobile is available for on-demand parking permits via the app at designated locations at UCSC. Please refer to the parking map for locations around campus. Additionally, eligible affiliates may purchase Daily A Permits via our virtual permitting portal.
Dining: Dining Services will open locations based on staff and resource availability. Please check for live dining updates posted via the campus status page, the Dining Services Instagram account @ucscdining, and on the Dining website.
Health services:  
The Student Health Center will continue to operate, although there may be a reduced number of appointments during the strike period. Students are encouraged to contact or visit the health center for urgent concerns. All cases will be promptly assessed and triaged. If same-day appointments are unavailable, students may be referred to nearby urgent care facilities to receive timely assistance. For support, students can call the 24/7 free nurse advice line at (831) 459-2591. For more details about off-campus healthcare resources, please visit the after-hours healthcare webpage.
CAPS will continue to offer counseling services, including daytime and after-hours crisis services. For assistance, including after hours and weekend crisis services, please call 831-459-2628. Help is available 24 hours a day. The Campus Mobile Crisis Team will continue normal operations and can be reached at 831-502-9988. For additional urgent mental health resources, please visit UC Santa Cruz‚Äôs crisis assistance webpage . Off-campus healthcare resources can be found on the after-hours healthcare webpage.  
UCSC supports protected free speech activities
UC Santa Cruz is committed to ensuring that all people may exercise their constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. The ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints is at the core of this commitment. The right to free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly, nondisruptive demonstrations which include non-obstructive picketing.
 
The campus‚Äôs interim Conduct Regulations protect the right to free speech and expressive activities at UC Santa Cruz while preserving the right to access to education, residences, and campus facilities free from obstruction. The campus‚Äôs Free Speech website provides additional information.
 
No employee is ever obligated to engage in collective labor activities, such as striking, picketing, or protesting. Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Academic and staff employees should remain in contact with their supervisors, managers, and chairs to discuss their schedules and work locations when warranted.

For questions, staff may call their Employee &amp; Labor Relations analyst in Staff HR or email elrinfo@ucsc.edu. Academic employees may reach out to their divisional Academic HR office.

If you feel you are being threatened, harassed, or intimidated about crossing the picket line, or are prevented from working by picketers or striking employees, please immediately notify your supervisor and your campus employee and labor relations office. In cases of emergency, please dial 9-1-1.
 
Blocking access roads harms members of the campus community
Preventing vehicles or individuals from entering or leaving campus, either by blocking roadways and intersections or by remaining in a crosswalk after the light has turned red, violates the law and campus policy, while also imposing burdens on those who already must overcome obstacles in their day. Students, staff, and faculty face additional difficulty getting to their classes, offices, and homes because buses are unable to cross onto campus. Parents face uncertainty or delays taking their children to school or childcare. Students, staff, faculty and their families living on campus experience delays and stress about getting to off-campus jobs or appointments on time.  Blocking or reducing access to campus entrances can result in discipline for both students and employees.

I encourage everyone to be patient and understanding during this time and to stay informed by visiting ucsc.edu/status. 
 
Sincerely,
Lori

1. Casinos are cash cows. UCSD could generate enough revenue to lower tuition, and allow the price center and the Wong Avery library to run 24 hours. 

2. Immediately solves the Geisel funding crisis. Geisel relies on university dollars in order to operate. The casino would practically pay for itself. 

3. It would also add tons of jobs for students. The casino would need dealers, slot attendants, surveillance officers, cashiers, hospitality staff, servers, bartenders, security, chefs, maintenance, etc.

UCSD is literally known for how long and hard we study. Did we get the nickname socially dead because everyone was going to parties at night? No, it's because everyone was at Geisel to study for their midterms/finals instead. I am hard-pressed to find someone who hasn't studied at Geisel after 10. 

Especially for younger undergrads, who might not be able to study in their tiny, triple converted room, Geisel served as a necessary resource for a safe and effective environment to learn. For graduate students, the library offered them a quiet spot after working long hours. We need to take action, for the administration will keep slashing our benefits paid for by our tuition dollars if we don't. Sit ins, walk outs, even another damn encampment, you name it, we need to do it. 

To those afraid of the school bringing in riot police again, let them. Let the school show their true colors, and though I cannot guarantee your safety, I can guarantee there will be hundreds of students in the front lines, still angry from last year's violence and eager to fight back. Last year, most student protestors had flags and loudspeakers. This year, if the school does the same thing, many more student protestors will have shields, armor, and gas masks having learned the lessons of the recent past. I dare UCSD to try it again.

This vote comes as UAW 4811 claims University of California has engaged in Unfair Labor Practices (ULP) following multiple encampments set up by anti-war students through many UCs. Unlike the general strike on Fall 2022, UAW 4811 is using what they called a Stand Up strike, a strategy that ""randomly"" selects work stoppages at specific locations and expands over time as more UCs are called to strike. This keeps the UC system guessing where and when the next stoppage will be. As part of this strategy UCSC was called to stand up on May 20th, UCLA and UCD on May 28th, and UCI, USCB, and UCSD on June 3rd.

Specifically for UCSD, these are some pictures taken on the first day of the strike. Protestors set up their operations and rallied at Warren Mall, gave speeches outside Geisel library, and had a ""UCSD's Complicity"" walking tour around several labs.

The overworked, underpaid, resentful TA will judge you and will deduct half a point from your next assignment out of spite. Get a scooter or skip the class.



Your residence hall will suck. When you switch later, the new one will suck even worse. As you cycle through every single residence hall and somehow end up in your original one, each one will suck worse than the previous one like an endless M.C. Escher recursive M√∂bius strip of suckiness. There is no escape. Better to camp in the canyon.



If you're concerned about the latest COVID surge, join the Main gym fencing club ‚Äì masks, gloves, and if anyone comes within six feet of you, you stab them. Legally.



If it's in Price Center and everyone likes it, it will be shut down.



Sun God Festival is a music event in the spring for you to get ejected for being projectile-level drunk and end up with an arrest record and badly sunburned. Unless Machiavelli von Coleslaw cancels it. Your fees will not be reduced in either case.



No one ever found out who left that axe in that Canyonview Aquatics locker or what they had done with it or what they were going to do with it or anything. That person is still out there. Have a good swim.



Quiet study areas are for you to enjoy other people's crappy music and personal dramas and the smell of their feet.



Campus police are there when you don't want them and they're not when you do. The second most dangerous place on campus is between them and Burger King. The number one most dangerous place is between Coleslaw and a TV camera.

It won't matter who your commencement keynote speaker will be. Weapons of mass death from Miramar Air Force Base will fly by repeatedly and drown that person out (they even did that to the Dalai freaking Lama a few years ago, I am not making that up).



Hazardous areas on campus include construction zones, bike lanes, and the back of any computer lab. Keep your eyes and ears open for the first two; bring a gas mask for the last one.



If your political beliefs differ from those of the person next to you, you're in favor of genocide. It doesn't matter which side you're on.



If you don't have time for one of the multiple gyms on campus, running the gantlet of Library Walk without making eye contact with any of the doomsday cultists will give you a good aerobics workout. They will try to lure you with free pizza and yogurt. Think of the witch in ""Hansel and Gretel"" and keep going.



Elevators are for making new friends when you get stuck for hours. Unless you're stuck with a stingray, which will try to kill you.



Every residence hall has that one person who thinks the microwave is broken because they put a potato in and pushed the pizza button and when the dinger dinged it was still a potato. That person will be your roommate.



If you lose anything on campus, it will be turned in to Lost and Found, where it will be lost.



If you forget to log off of your university desktop computer, a non-affiliate will use their bat echolocation to find it within 30 seconds and they will clog your search history with raccoon porn. Your account will then be flagged by IT and you will be brought up before the Standards and Conduct Committee. Your transcripts will be red-flagged forever. You'll never get into MIT, Salk will never hire you, and you'll never get a Nobel. Log off your computer every time.



You will spend one hundred to two hundred hours each year for the rest of your life deleting donation solicitations from the alumni fund. Every attempt to unsubscribe will double the number of messages, like the Hydra of legend. You are in the funnel, you will be assimilated, and you cannot kill the beast.

1cuhfgg,UCSD,You will regret ghosting and keeping your circle small,"So we all know UC Socially Dead, but many of the people complaining about it are the very ones doing everything they can to keep the tradition up: Flaking on plans. Standing people up. Ghosting. Being ""too busy"" to do anything.

Take it from a graduate student who took time off to work after undergraduate school: **You will regret closing yourself off. You will regret that behaviour.** Once you graduate, you're on your own. The real world does not care about you. You must rely on connections and networks to get by. ""But I have a college degree and good grades!"" So does everyone else applying to that job you want. But some of them have an advantage in the world because they know people who know people who know people. You don't know anyone except those two or three people you stayed with and refused to get to know anyone else. Or because you only talked to people of your own race/nationality.

The old saying is absolutely true: *It's not what you know. It's who you know.* Every job I've had since 2018 was because of the people I knew. I have not had a job interview in six years. I've been given the jobs because someone told the supervisors to hire me. Once I was offered a job in a state I didn't live in, but I knew someone who lived there and she let me stay with her for as long as I needed.

Lastly, get to know people OUTSIDE of your major and race and nationality. You can learn so much from other demographics, and what you can learn WILL come in handy one day.

**TLDR;** *Stop ghosting and cutting yourself at UCSD. Make friends with many people from different demographics. The world outside of school is cold and uncaring, and only your large network of friends and associates will save you.*",-0.53,Social

However, I am really uncomfortable every time I walk past them. This is not a politics thing.

Also, aren‚Äôt these people who don‚Äôt work at or attend UCSD MOSTLY?

Edit: I now feel the need to reiterate this again due to the mass amount of pro-Israel people in this comment section assuming I am pro-Palestine or the like and therefore me being afraid of the pro-Israel protestors is invalid. First off, this is not a political thing, I am speaking from a personal safety standpoint. Secondly, even if I were one way or the other politically, they are still scary. Please do not comment with the assumption that I am either way and please be civil.

1ckz4hz,UCSD,Lessons from the Arab Spring,"Hello everyone! It‚Äôs me the world‚Äôs oldest undergrad.
One of the reasons I didn‚Äôt finish my undergrad degree a decade ago was because I was a refugee traveling the Middle East and joining protests during the Arab Spring. (And getting kicked out)

I thought (for no reason) to share some exp of the problems and lessons we learned back then.


1- discuss who is willing to go to jail and who isn‚Äôt. If you have privilege, this is your time to use it! If you‚Äôre an international student or the authority can harm you. Don‚Äôt risk it.

2- BE NICE TO THE COPS! This bothered me yesterday. The police and anyone the other side sends are just doing their jobs. If you keep shouting at them that they are monsters. Guess how they will act!?  Instead smile. Ask if they are ok. Offer them tea, cookies. Make them see that you are human too! 

3- think about the optics. Don‚Äôt put your scariest members in the front. Don‚Äôt leave trash hanging. Try to smile and be extra polite even when dealing with counter protesters. You can refuse to talk to the media if you want to present a unified message. But do it smiling and apologizing. Don‚Äôt give them that 30 second clip that they‚Äôre looking for that shows you angry.

4- Paranoia destroys movements! One way the authorities try to destroy a movement is by spreading fear and mistrust between everyone. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a mole!‚Äù , ‚Äúthey‚Äôre a plant!‚Äù, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all watching us!‚Äù. While some safety precaution is needed, trust me when I say you‚Äôre not that important yet for them to go through all that effort. All they need to do is make you mistrust and hate one another.

5- Rumor mills can exhaust you. Stuff such as ‚Äúthe cops are coming at 3 am!‚Äù Will keep showing up. And the cops will show up eventually. But until they do get some rest. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Get rest. Take shifts.

6- Think about the future. Right now you have access to water, food, electrcity,  and bathrooms.
These things can be taken away. Think about how to deal with that possibility. 

7- Take breaks. Siege mentality is dangerous.  Being in the same place with the same people facing the unknown will affect your mental health and warps your view of reality. Go out for a bit while you can. Take walks. Talk to people outside. Do other stuff. 

8- Make it fun. This is the hardest one to accept since you are protesting a very serious matter! But moral is important. And some people will be initially just in it ‚Äúfor the vibes‚Äù, but those same people will get exposure to the cause as they come. Make it appealing and ‚Äúcool‚Äù.


Good luck. And don‚Äôt be shy to learn from the exp of others.

I would, but I know that you know that what you did was low. Because I know you know the person that is this professor and that they are the furthest from being antisemitic based on the materials covered in the course and their entire demeanor for the past 10 weeks you've known them. This instructor has been more than generous, accommodating, supportive and flexible, not to mention humble and real. 

The irony is that it seems as though it was difficult for you to grasp the concept of the course and the messages embedded. This isn't about discrimination. Discrimination is not tolerated, obviously, and you'd be justified if it were true. I know this professor is above this act and that they will not let it beat them down because they know who they are and live impeccably. 

 This incident is a prime example of the coddled and entitled mindset I often witness in students, not considering the impact your words and actions have on everyone else. I will not just defend this professor but also remind you that this will bite you in the ass at some point.

1cm178y,UCSD,UCSD Dept of Ethnic Studies released a statement earlier today,"The full statement from their website is below:

We are writing as extremely concerned faculty and graduate students within the Ethnic Studies
Department at the University of California, San Diego, to call attention to the 5-month-long Israeli
attempt to exterminate the Palestinian population in Gaza and their unbreakable spirit of resistance
through relentless land, sea, and air attacks, the manufacturing of lies in the media, establishing
‚Äúsafe zones‚Äù only to launch renewed attacks, and garnering international material support ‚Äì including
our tax dollars ‚Äì to enact this genocide (read our previous statement below). It has been extremely
frightening, in particular, to see the Israeli military launch air raids on Rafah in southern Gaza and
warn of an imminent ground offensive where an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians are seeking
shelter. It is urgent to speak out against these assaults on Rafah also because it is the main entry
point for humanitarian aid via Egypt and is extremely essential for a population of almost 2.3 million
Palestinians who have been systematically pushed into starvation and famine. In this genocidal
moment, where we have lost 30,000 Palestinian lives and counting, the least we can say is
CEASEFIRE NOW.


Situated within the University of California system and the heart of imperial knowledge productions in
general, as a department committed to an internationalist stance on liberation, our employment at
UCSD requires us to heed calls for UC divestment and participate in a definitive academic and
cultural boycott of the settler Israeli apartheid state, as demanded by Palestinian civil society and
modeled after the 35-year-long consumer boycott that was at the heart of the anti-apartheid
movement in South Africa. That the university profits from the exploitation of lives and extraction of
resources from communities both at home and abroad is not acceptable to us. We call immediate
attention to the fact that instead of investing in students and workers, the UC system invests directly
and indirectly in weapon contractors that harm not only Palestinians but also Indigenous
communities globally, other people of color, and the working class peoples across Turtle Island.


We call on our peers across UCSD and the UC system to heed the call for Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions and respect the picket line until Israel meets its baseline human rights obligations to the
Palestinian population under international law:

Ending its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall
Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality and
Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their
homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 1948.

1cin4o7,UCSD,Day 1 at the Encampment,"TLDR: join the camp, it‚Äôs fun and everyone there was caring and friendly and it was like having a picnic with friends with chanting. Also if you‚Äôre going to argue in the comments about *all* students feeling safe on campus - this group has not given a reason for anyone to feel unsafe. All are welcome unless you‚Äôre trying to get shitty clickbait sound clips and are narcs. 

I was on my way to Hopkins after my AM class and saw that the camp was getting set up. I stood around to see what was happening and it was kind of crazy seeing people running from PC to the grass. Everyone seemed organized even though it didn‚Äôt look like they really knew how to put up tents. 

I grabbed Jamba then headed back to the hammocks and I saw one of my friends walk into the camp so I met up with them. It was around 1 or so and things were pretty much set up with snacks and water and people claiming their tents for the night. 

Then there was the presentation from a professor/activist at a CSU. Listening to them speak was very interesting because they were expelled from Palestine in 1948 when they were about 6 years old. The students also put up a timeline of activism at UCSD since the 70s. Afterwards I hung out with my friend and other Jewish students who educated me a little bit about their stance. Pretty much everyone there was chilling and it felt super safe. I was there till about 5 and not once did I hear any hate for the Jewish community. No one was speaking ill about Jewish people or calling for violence. There was a moment where we did huddle to talk about safety in case of police aggression but not once did anyone ever say to attack anybody. The priority really was to keep one another safe by staying close and traveling in groups. 

I went back with my roommates around 11 and again it was chill. We sat in the grass by the hammocks and even tho police were wandering there were no issues. I think as long as the camp is peaceful not calling for harm and not disrupting students accessing learning spaces, they should be allowed to stay. Any escalation that happens would solely be on the police and other agitators as the programming so far has been contained to inside the camp. 

Edit: I just wanted to add that like previous demonstrations on campus disruptions could happen so figure out alternate ways to class :) the campus is enormous enough with different pathways to everything.  

Remember, there are no more universities in Gaza because of Israel. We as an educational institution should not stand for or support the atrocities with our dollars. 

Edit 2: there are clearly going to be agitators online here as well and despite being anonymous, please don‚Äôt say fucked up shit on this thread in response to clear agitators who actually believe collective punishment is a valid response for the actions of a faction.",-0.14,Politics

1co4vxh,UCSD,What Khosla Should‚Äôve Done,"Let‚Äôs imagine you‚Äôre a dipshit former CEO who for some reason really wants to keep their job at a public university. An encampment forms on your campus. Sun God is in a few days. This isn‚Äôt what I would personally do if I was chancellor, I would‚Äôve fully divested and implemented the demands in full. Instead, this is from the perspective of a rich elitist asshole like Khosla. Here‚Äôs what a smart dipshit would‚Äôve done: 

1. Don‚Äôt Cancel Sun God. If anything happened during Sun God, it would‚Äôve been much more justification to remove the encampment by force. All this decision did was make Khosla and the administration seem like they were utilizing collective punishment and divide and conquer tactics. 
2.  Negotiate with the organizers, offer to implement half their demands. Divest some money and do some accounting tricks to make it seem like less money is going to DOD contracts, and if need be to please donors, quietly reinvest that money in a couple years. 
3. Wait out the encampment. Realistically, these are a buncha nerds in tents, and they weren‚Äôt interrupting operations. The encampment would‚Äôve faded into the back of the student body‚Äôs mind until one of the participants makes a mistake to justify its removal. 
4. When removing the encampment, make it a condition that the police can‚Äôt wear riot gear. No one was rioting, no one was throwing rocks, no one was throwing punches that justified the shields and batons. A large body of scientific literature suggests that when protestors perceive the police as using disproportionate force, they are more likely to respond with violence, and that the presence of riot police has a psychological effect on protestors that only creates more tension. UCSD students are relatively passive, they don‚Äôt want to fight the police unless they feel like they really have to. 
5. Give student conduct violations, but request that charges be dropped. After the police removes the encampment without riot gear, Khosla should‚Äôve let the school handle disciplinary action. Criminal action makes it seem like the encampment was full of criminals, when so many people walked by and saw how peaceful it was. The worst crime committed via the encampment was trespassing. Last year, Khosla should‚Äôve learned his lesson when police arrested three Grad students for‚Ä¶ chalk on the sidewalk. He received hella criticism and later the charges were dropped. 
6. Make multiple physical appearances at the encampment and talk to the organizers. Get a realistic feel of what the encampment is like without reading it from a UCPD report, pictures taken of Khosla at the encampment would‚Äôve made great propaganda. 

The series of decisions that Khosla has made baffles me. He did nothing to seem nuanced and pragmatic, even the hardcore Khosla lickers don‚Äôt have an arguable defense for his actions. I would argue that Khosla isn‚Äôt completely evil, more extremely incompetent in realizing how much public support is needed to effectively govern a university. Just because you brought in money doesn‚Äôt protect you from getting fired.",-0.73,Politics

1fmzkc4,UCSD,Regarding UCSD's New Restrictions on Protesting,"Per the new ""time, place, and manner"" policy, if you tried to protest Geisel's hour cuts today, they wouldn't even let you stand outside the library past 11:00 PM. This policy was issued on September 19th, 2024, just 3 days ago, after the UC Regents met at UCLA. Here they discussed topics such as their [salary increase](https://web.archive.org/web/20240921230448/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-09-20/uc-chancellors-get-big-raises), [approval for more military equipment](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/regmeet/sept24/c1.pdf), and updates to the [Policy &amp; Procedure Manual (PPM)](https://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/ppm/docs/toc510.HTML).

Here are a few things that changed or were reiterated:

* Expressive activity is now only allowed between 6:00 AM and 11:00 PM
* Unless a walkout or near the silent tree, expressive activity involving more than 75 people requires an email notice at least 24 hours in advance
* No masking during expressive activity for the purpose of ‚Äúconcealing identity‚Äù
* No ‚Äú...refusing to reveal one‚Äôs identity when asked to do so by University personnel‚Äù
* Effectively, demonstrating outside the chancellor‚Äôs residence is now prohibited
* No flags unless the wood handle is within ¬º‚Äù x ¬æ‚Äù x 18‚Äù

The policies that were updated include:

[510-1 SECTION V.A Interim Policy on Major Events on Campus](https://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/ppm/docs/510-1.5a.HTML)

https://preview.redd.it/9rwb6v03feqd1.png?width=989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc8a31763001b9195b2bf9b0e9a3d87f42208e2a

**Expressive Activity**

Looking at *510-1 SECTION IX Interim Policy on Expressive Activity Time, Place, and Manner*, this is the first time the policy has been updated in 14 years. This revision supersedes the one made on October 4th, 2010. Let‚Äôs start with some definitions:

&gt;‚Äú**Expressive Activity** means any speech or conduct protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the California Constitution. Expressive Activity may include, but is not limited to, certain assemblies, demonstrations, speeches, distributing and posting Literature, carrying signs, and/or circulating petitions.‚Äù \[1\]

&gt;

&gt;‚Äú**University Property** means any University-owned, -operated, -leased, -controlled, or -maintained property, including all University grounds and structures or such other property as may be designated by the campus as property subject to University Policy, including ‚ÄúProperty‚Äù as defined in PACAOS 14.20 and ‚ÄúUniversity Property‚Äù as defined in the Regulations Governing Conduct of Non-Affiliates in the Buildings and on the Grounds of the University of California.‚Äù \[1\]

Perhaps the most consequential changes are **B1** and **B2**, under **GENERAL RULES**, which basically prohibits any kind of Expressive Activity overnight:

&gt;‚Äú1. ¬† ¬† **Permitted Conduct.** Subject to the rules in this Policy\*,\* other University Policies, and applicable laws, between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 11 p.m., Expressive Activity is permitted on outdoor University Property that is open to the public (excluding athletic fields/courts, parking lots and garages, the Epstein Family Amphitheater, vehicles, and maritime vessels). The outdoor University Property that is open to the public is subject to change at any time, with or without notice. All persons subject to this policy are required to follow the instructions of authorized University Officials regarding whether a particular space is open or closed to the public. Expressive Activities with more than 75 people are considered Major Events and are also subject to the rules and regulations stated in the Major Events Policy, PPM 510-1, Section V.A.‚Äù \[1\]

&gt;‚Äú2. ¬† ¬† **Time of Use.** Between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., outdoor open spaces, lawns, walkways, bike paths, roadways, crosswalks, fire lanes, parking lots, parking structures, and/or other thoroughfares are closed to all activities except coming and going to/from a University building, crossing the campus, or as part of a University Supported Activity.‚Äù \[1\]

This means demonstrations, speeches, posting literature, carrying signs, etc., are not permitted between 11:00 PM - 6:00 AM. Furthermore, given the broad interpretation of Expressive Activity this could mean that even if you are just standing or sitting without chanting or creating any inconvenience, you could still be in violation of this policy. For instance, during the UCSD Gaza solidarity encampment, this would imply that the people hanging around library walk and the lawn in front of the encampment would be breaking this policy, even if they never entered the encampment.

**Major Events**

Another important detail that is mentioned is that ‚Äú...Expressive Activities with more than 75 people are considered Major Events.‚Äù We can find the definition in *510-1 SECTION V.A Interim Policy on Major Events on Campus*:

&gt;‚Äú**Major Event**: A planned gathering including but not limited to parties, dances, lectures, forums, performances, rallies, demonstrations, social gatherings, concerts, speaker presentations, and conferences, at which one or more of the following conditions apply:

&gt;¬†

&gt;(1)¬† ¬† The Event Sponsor anticipates over 75 persons are likely to be in attendance at the Event at any one time; or

&gt;¬†

&gt;(2)¬† ¬† The Event requires completion of a campus Use of Alcohol Permit issued through the UC San Diego Police Department.

&gt;¬†

&gt;In addition to the above, the University may on its own initiative designate an event to be a Major Event if the University reasonably determines that more than 75 persons are likely to attend the event at any one time or that the nature of the event poses unusual security risks. If the University designates an event as a Major Event, the University will give notice to the Event Sponsor and the Event Sponsor may contest that determination by submitting a written appeal in accordance with the appeals process specified in this policy.

&gt;¬†

&gt;A Major Event does not include classes, department meetings and seminars, concerts, performances, conferences, camps, or athletic practices, contests, or tournaments authorized and sponsored by the University as part of the ordinary operations of the University.‚Äù\[2\]

While it seems like most Expressive Activity in the form of protests or demonstrations would fall under Major Events, they might actually fall under Spontaneous Events, which, unlike Major Events, do not require Event Approval, but they do require notice.

&gt;‚Äú**Spontaneous Events.** Demonstrations, protests, vigils, or other assemblies which are occasioned by and are in response to news or public affairs coming into public knowledge less than seven calendar days before the Event occurs.‚Äù \[2\]

Using the *wayback machine* from the *Internet Archive* we can look at the previous revision of the policy from November 29th, 2022 \[3\]. Comparing the documents we can see that adding the Spontaneous Events definition and its respective rules were one of the main policy changes. We also notice that the minimum number of people for an event to be considered major was reduced from 100 to 75. Before looking at the new rules for Spontaneous Events, we need to start with the definition of Non-University Sponsors:

&gt;‚Äú**Non-University Sponsor:** An Event Sponsor who is (1) an individual not currently employed by the University, (2) an employee of the University acting outside the course and scope of their University employment or without the knowledge and approval of their Vice Chancellor or, in the case of an employee of the Health System, the Chief Executive Office, UC San Diego Health, or (3) a group, association, corporation, registered student organization, or other combination of individuals that is not an Academic Department or an Administrative Department.‚Äù \[2\]

We see that, generally speaking, Spontaneous Events require a notice via email before any organizing or advertising can take place:

&gt;‚Äú**3.3.** **Spontaneous Events**

&gt;¬†

&gt;3.3.1¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† For Spontaneous Events where 75 or more people are anticipated to participate, the rules stated in this Section 3.3 apply.

&gt;¬†

&gt;3.3.2¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Spontaneous Events do not require University permission; however, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.3.4, Non-University Sponsors of a Spontaneous Event must provide notice via email to the Vice Chancellor ‚Äì Student Affairs and Campus Life ([vcsa@ucsd.edu](mailto:vcsa@ucsd.edu)) and to the Vice Chancellor ‚Äì Operations Management and Capital Planning ([vcomcp@ucsd.edu](mailto:vcomcp@ucsd.edu)) at least 24 hours in advance of the Spontaneous Event. The notice must include the name of the organizer, the news or public affairs occasioning the Spontaneous Event, and the intended location of the Spontaneous Event. The organizer of the Spontaneous Event must have a copy of the required notice at the Spontaneous Event and must produce a copy of the notice to University Officials upon request. Organizing or promoting a Spontaneous Event without providing the required notice is prohibited and may result in discipline and/or criminal or civil liability. The University reserves the right to terminate Spontaneous Events if the required notice has not been timely provided.

&gt;¬†

&gt;3.3.3¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† When the notice required in Section 3.3.2 has been timely provided, Spontaneous Events may use any outdoor space on the UC San Diego main campus that is available for Expressive Activity under Policy and Procedure Manual 510-1, Section IX. Spontaneous Events must remain outdoors and may not use or enter a University Facility.‚Äù \[2\]

However, we have two exceptions:

&gt;‚Äú3.3.4¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Spontaneous Events are exempt from the notice requirement of Section 3.3.2 under either of the following circumstances:

&gt;¬†

&gt;(1)¬† ¬† The Spontaneous Event takes place at the corner of Library Walk near the silent tree in front of Geisel Library.

&gt;¬†

&gt;(2)¬† ¬† The Spontaneous Event consists of a sidewalk march where the participants are consistently moving and where the march does not impede traffic, block the entrances or exits of buildings or parking lots or garages, or create excessive noise.‚Äù \[2\]

The area that constitutes the ‚Äúcorner of Library Walk‚Äù is a bit ambiguous given that it doesn‚Äôt provide any specific details other than ‚Äúnear the silent tree‚Äù and it is likely subject to interpretation by the administration. Still, in the case where the demonstration is not a sidewalk march, and occurs in any other place, the email notice is required. It also begs the question of what is necessary for the demonstration to be considered a march, how long can you remain in the same place before the demonstration is no longer considered a sidewalk march?

**Masking**

Going back to *510-1 SECTION IX Interim Policy on Expressive Activity Time, Place, and Manner*, another addition to the policy is **B7** under **GENERAL RULES**:

&gt;‚Äú7. ¬† ¬† **No Disguises.** No person may wear a mask, personal disguise, and/or otherwise conceal their identity with the intent of intimidating any person or group, or for the purpose of evading or hindering discovery, recognition, or identification in the commission of violations of University Policy, University regulations, and/or local, state, or federal laws.‚Äù \[1\]

This is likely a direct result of the pro-Palestinian protests, eventual Gaza solidarity encampment, and Spring 2024 strike in which a lot of people used face coverings to avoid surveillance from UCSD administration, for cultural/religious reasons, and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is unclear how the administration will determine the purpose of masking, but it will likely be up to their interpretation. In addition to **B7**, the UC President, Michael V. Drake, announced some updates on UC campus climate efforts \[4\]. In his letter he mentioned that one of the steps to ‚Äú...facilitate more consistency across our locations‚Ä¶‚Äù would be ‚Äú...reinforcing requirements for policies impacting expressive activities‚Ä¶‚Äù such as ‚Äú...refusing to reveal one‚Äôs identity when asked to do so by University personnel.‚Äù

**Demonstrations/Gatherings**

There also seems to be a more subtle change (addition) made in *510-1 SECTION IX Interim Policy on Expressive Activity Time, Place, and Manner,* **C2** under **DEMONSTRATIONS/GATHERINGS**. This implicitly prohibits protesting outside of Chancellor Khosla‚Äôs residence, the Audrey Geisel University House, as this is technically considered University Property. There have been recent demonstrations outside of the Chancellor‚Äôs residence before, for instance, *Faculty for Justice in Palestine* (FJP) on May 10th, 2024 \[5\], and Graduate students during the Fall 2022 strike \[6\].

&gt;‚Äú**C.**¬† ¬† **DEMONSTRATIONS/GATHERINGS**

&gt;¬†  
1.¬† ¬† Individuals and organizations may engage in demonstrations or gatherings on outdoor University Property (excluding athletic fields/courts, parking lots and garages, the Epstein Family Amphitheater, vehicles, and maritime vessels), provided that such activities comply with this Policy, local, state, and federal laws, and other applicable University rules\*.\* Demonstrations or gatherings with more than 75 people must also comply with the Major Events Policy, PPM 510-1, Section V.A.

&gt;¬†

&gt;2. ¬† ¬† Individuals and organizations are prohibited from picketing or organizing picketing that is focused on and takes place in front of any University Property that is a residence or dwelling of an individual, including as prohibited by Sections 52.2001-2003 of the San Diego Municipal Code.‚Äù \[1\]

**Sign Handles**

A bit more on the miscellaneous side, **B4** under **GENERAL RULES** states that sign handles must be made of wood and not exceed ¬º‚Äù x ¬æ‚Äù x 18‚Äù. This would imply that most common flag poles would be prohibited since their diameter usually exceeds ¬º‚Äù.

&gt;‚Äú4. ¬† ¬† **Sign Handles.** Handles or supports for signs, posters, placards, flags, and/or banners must be made of wood. The use of metal stakes, clubs, and/or pipes is prohibited. The size of wood handles or supports is limited to one-fourth of an inch (1/4‚Äù) in thickness by three-fourths of an inch (3/4‚Äù) in width and may extend no more than 18 inches beyond a single exterior edge of a sign, poster, placard, flag, and/or banner.‚Äù \[1\]

1gzmjgs,UCSD,DO NOT work at Triton Transit (Shuttles),"In addition to the [bookstore](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1gxq6xa/do_not_work_at_the_bookstore/) post a few days ago, the bookstore is managed by the same individual who oversees the shuttles, and both departments are now in disarray. At shuttles, the environment has become toxic, with student drivers routinely belittled and the department run like a dictatorship. Employees are given no voice or influence; instead, they are ordered to follow the rules without question or face termination. 

Midway through the quarter, they abruptly changed the relief vehicle/ride policy, leaving many students struggling. Often, drivers need a vehicle or ride to get to their assigned routes, as shifts frequently begin and end at different locations. However, the new policy eliminates the provision of rides or vehicles, creating logistical issues and leaving drivers stranded. This is especially concerning for female drivers, who often find themselves stuck in unsafe locations late at night. The night managers, both female, have raised these safety concerns with the three male day managers, but the issues have been ignored. These directives come from JOSH, the top manager, who has shown no regard for addressing these safety risks.

There was also an incident where a bus caught fire, and the smoke caused the driver to fall ill. Instead of showing concern for their safety, management immediately removed the driver from their duties, focusing on minimizing costs for missed shifts rather than addressing the vehicle defect or the employee‚Äôs well-being. After months of persistence, the student driver was finally compensated for their lost wages.

Another problematic policy prohibits students from missing work for midterms. For many of us in STEM fields, midterms are often scheduled outside of lecture and discussion times. To take these exams, we must either find a coworker to cover our shift or call out, which accrues attendance points and leads to disciplinary action. Last quarter, a female student driver fell ill and provided a doctor‚Äôs note but was still threatened with reprimand for missing ‚Äúexcessive work.‚Äù Familiar with California labor laws, she had to educate management by sending them highlighted sections of legal documentation, forcing them to back down.

Communication from the male managers is another significant issue. They frequently modify students‚Äô schedules without notifying them, citing the handbook‚Äôs clause that schedules can be changed to meet departmental needs. While this policy exists, it would be professional and courteous to inform employees of such changes. The lack of communication reflects poorly on management and undermines the notion that we are all working professionals.

1cjlmon,UCSD,Uyghur Muslims,"If I get massive downvoted for this topic then so be it.  But through out all of my years at UCSD, I've never seen anyone protest for the Uyghur Muslims who are being persecuted by the Chinese government and there have been reports of internment camps and genocide being committed over the years.  I even remember outcry over a student presenting this issue in a world politics course and it ended with the assignment being cancelled because you had Chinese students claiming it was fake news and propaganda.  You can find this exact incident posted on UCSD reddit around 2019 to 2020.  The point I'm trying to make here is that everyone is protesting the Israel and Palestinian war happening right now, but I don't recall anyone speaking up for the Uyghurs who have been wronged by their government.  It feels a bit hypocritical from my point of view and perhaps a discussion can shed some light.  But let's get some things straight.

1.  If you support the Chinese government, you are entitled to your opinion.  You want to claim that this is fake then so be it, I've personally have seen more evidence that shows the Uyghurs being wronged.  But if you have contradicting reports that disprove what I've said then feel free to speak up on that.
2.  I'm trying to understand why people are willing to protest for Palestinians but not the Uyghurs.
3.  I'm well aware that the Isreal/Palestinian problem has been going on since post WW2 so I guess it takes precedence, but that still doesn't explain why people are quiet with Uyghurs but are actively protesting the Israel/Palestine war.

1d5vxc5,UCSD,Spilling my gatekept hotspots since I'm graduating,"Wanted to shoutout a few of my favorite SD places since I'm leaving and they all deserve the hype tbh:

Cafe Vahik- this is a little cafe down in Windansea. The owner is Vahik and every time I stop by, he's there. He knows everyone's name and their favorite orders and is so nice. He tells people stories about food from Iran and how it inspired him to make his menu. Literally the most humble guy and a total gem. The food is amazing btw and really affordable. Their chai actually tastes like chai and everything is made to order.

  
Havana Grill off Clairemont Mesa - went here on a whim once and now it's a go-to. Their sandwiches are super good but the star of the place is their plantains (in any form) and their guava cheese pastries. Literally to die for and the portion sizes are hugee. 

  
Hot Spot in Liberty Station- if you're looking for more activities to do that won't break the bank, this is the place. It's like a local color-me-mine inside Liberty Station. Their prices for their ceramics aren't crazy and they have great variety. You can also stay as long as you like so if you get hungry, you can grab some food from the market and come back. It fills up sometimes but they've let us bring blankets out on the lawn and paint outside too. Super fast turnaround time for the glaze too.

  
Libraries- if you're like me and love third spaces but hate how much Geisel smells like feet, try going off campus to some of the public libraries! North University Community library is pretty close to campus over by UTC and is a good go-to. It's quiet and there are outlets available. I also really enjoy the ones in La Mesa and Del Mar (it's literally the most beautiful little library I've been in). You can also pick up a library card to either the city or county libraries (or both!) which lets you use Libby for ebooks or checking out books through the system. 

  
The Hole in the Wall Bar- this one's in Midway near Liberty Station and is so worth checking out, especially if you're in the LGBTQ scene. I'm not a huge clubbing fan and Hillcrest is super overstimulating which is why I love this place so much. It's an indoor/outdoor venue with a sunken garden area in the front with karaoke and sometimes a popup small business. The central bar area is inside and has a pool table. People are always mingling around in the front and back and chatting with others. We go on Thursdays and I've never seen so many queer women in one place it is really a great community. They have other event days and the rest of the week is more in the coed-scene. I've actually made a lot of friends there and highly recommend it for college-age nightlife.

  
If you want to learn new things but craft center/rec class prices are too crazy: check out the San Diego community center classes! They're usually taught by other members of the community so the prices are more affordable and they have all sorts of different offerings. It's a great way to meet people outside of the UCSD bubble and to learn something cool!",0.83,Social

The U-Pass program was last extended in 2019 by we the students (well, probably not anyone still here). As it is funded by a student fee, only students have the power to either pass or block these things. The program was extended for about 6 years. 2019 + 6 = 2025, so the program is expiring later this academic year.

**HOWEVER!! There's a referendum being held next quarter.** It's up to us, the students, to decide on whether or not we want to continue having all of these awesome transit options amounting to about 1/3 of the cost of a basic MTS monthly pass.

This referendum will also include some other cool things like parking improvements, bike storage safety improvements, faster electrification of the university's buses, summer U-Pass for all students regardless of if taking classes during summer, the list goes on.

Again, the power rests within the students. The admin doesn't take the L this time. We're still some time away from the referendum, but just know that it is **VERY important that you show up to vote** (online, on your phone or computer).",-0.2,Politics

The American Revolution was a terrorist act. The student protests against the Vietnam War was just as 'against university policy' back then.

The FBI sent Martin Luther King Jr. a letter pretending to be a 'fellow Black man' urging him to FUCKING KILL HIMSELF.

What is legal and what is moral are rarely exact or even necessarily close matches to each other. The only way to affect change and speak truth to power is to engage in, yes preferably peaceful, CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. Peaceful protest entirely within the law is pushed so strongly by the education system in their whitewashed, sanitized version of the Civil Rights movement because if the government can teach people that legal protest is the only acceptable form of protest, it means that they get to define WHAT PROTEST IS and thus define it in such a way that it EXCLUDES PROTEST THAT IS EFFECTIVE.

Participants will be publicly executed on Sun God lawn. Everyone will be required to attend so that you will stop being naughty boys and girls.

But because nerds set up a book club with tents on Library Walk, I had no choice but to send in my goons. 

When my head goon texted me that they had completed the free speech suppression session, I was appalled at what I read. The protestors had brought a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Fighter Multirole Aircraft to the encampment, raising safety concerns for fire marshals. That is why I had to have my goons beat the protestors and mace an Imam. For safety. In addition, the encampment had brought in 20 outside agitators from the WWE federation. The WWE- which promotes violence and hate nationally- had brought in radical criminal elements such as John Cena, Jesse Ventura, and Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson, threatening our Jewish community. 

We will try our best to pretend this never happened so that I don‚Äôt get fired.

1fzkbb4,UCSD,the year is 2040,"**Central Campus**

* All restaurants in Price Center except Tapioca Express have closed
* Geisel is only open from 2-4pm
* Students have forgotten about Sun God because admin keeps finding reasons to cancel it every year
* Library Walk (and any critical walkways connecting to it) have been fenced off to support the construction of the New New Triton Student Center‚Ñ¢! It uses tuition money from current students but is scheduled to complete in 2060.

**Markets &amp; Dining Halls**

* All markets are powered by AI only, it uses machine learning to detect what you‚Äôre grabbing off the shelves (10% confidence)
   * If you say something, TritonGPT adds the closest thing to your cart using AI Natural Language Processing ‚ú®
   * Markets' prices are automatically increased by $0.04 every hour to account for inflation
* To support budget cuts, dining halls only serve 1 menu item per day

**Parking**

* All parking spots are reserved for khosla and there is a random lottery for the remaining spots
   * (students cannot join the parking lottery unless they have completed the Tritons Together Parking Workshop, offered in-person a few times a quarter with limited seats)

**Student Orgs &amp; Activities**

* To help promote student safety at ""on-campus gatherings"", UCPD has been equipped with (lethal) military-grade weaponry
   * Any protests are ***proactively*** prevented: any student that even attempts to meet up with other students or speak loudly is immediately sent to the dungeon of student conduct
* Student orgs regularly fight over event reservations and tabling spots. UCPD treats this as a ‚Äúpeaceful protest‚Äù and immediately flattens the event and anything in the immediate vicinity (to protect the safety of the students)
* A.S. now gives student orgs a whopping $0.50 per student per event
   * (this fund can only be used for temporary items)

**Construction**

* All funds from budget cuts have been diverted to help khosla purchase the entire UTC mall. It has been converted into the new East Campus. Nearby office buildings have been retrofitted as the 14th-18th colleges.
* Khosla has begun drafting plans for the Super Triton Megaplex‚Ñ¢! It's located on the northeast outskirts of campus, beyond Warren. The perfect place to study between classes.

**Day-to-Day**

* All usage of water fountains on-campus is immediately charged to your Triton Water 2 Go! account
   * You must scan the unique barcode on the bottom of your Triton Water 2 Go! reusable bottle, or else an additional $5 will be charged per bottle
* All students are now required to carry an electronic Triton ID‚Ñ¢ that tracks their Triton Score‚Ñ¢. Visiting the khosla statue (which was recently installed to replace Sun God) and attending student events increases their Triton Score‚Ñ¢. Staying in their dorm actively decays their Triton Score‚Ñ¢.
   * Triton ID‚Ñ¢ expires and stops working every quarter. You must renew it, there is a $50 renewal fee.
* The UCSD supercomputer regularly catches fire due to students using it to mine bitcoin. As a result, Resnet constantly crashes and students must submit their assignments in-person.

I'm only going to my college graduation, marshall, because I just kinda want this all to be over. I transferred and failed to find and/or create my own group of friends. I never found my niche. I had so many temporary friends but it's hard to keep them consistent. They come and they go. And when you're not in a group, it's hard to compete with people's other friends, SOs, jobs, and classes. I wanted to make friends but it just never happened. Unlucky I guess? Bad at making friends? I'm not sure. I know that I can make friends though. There's nothing inherently wrong with me. I can carry a conversation, relative funny, not insanely hideous. It's probably anxiety though. I've definitely found myself not texting people I've met in class for fear of them judging me. I hate myself for it. At the same time friendship is 2 ways, so they did have an opportunity to text me and ask if I wanted to hang out. 

While this is true, I definitely didn't try hard enough. I could've just asked someone to hang out or get coffee, or do something. I did a few times but it's disheartening when friendships are continously fleeting. I never really went out on weekends, didn't go to parties.

I have family coming for my graduation and might sit with roommates during graduation but that's it.

1diaaxr,UCSD,To future UCSD off campus renters: AVOID ALLINA LA JOLLA,"As the title suggests, I‚Äôd like to warn other students about this off campus apartment complex: 

Allina La Jolla is managed and owned by a mega corporation who does not care about the people that live there at all. They know they have the demand for housing from UCSD AND that they have a lot of inexperienced renters and they abuse this fact with predatory and even illegal tactics.

I began living there when it was under the old ‚Äúmom &amp; pop‚Äù style management company and it was initially great, it was cheaper than most stuff nearby and utilities and stuff were included so it was a no brainer. Under this new company though, it is not worth it - it is just as expensive as everything else nearby with amenities that never work and constant issues such as lack of parking, no access to offices or anyone to help with issues, and even certain maintenance issues i.e. not fixing or brushing off issues we have brought up. 

They have a complete lack of communication and transparency even when it comes to matters involving money and move-in/move-out dates which can impact a lot of their tenants. When you wish to address issues prepare to be spoken down to and disrespected passive-aggressively. Then you can attempt to call the actual management company ‚ÄúFPI management‚Äù and get no response at all. Look them up if you‚Äôre considering living here because THEY are who you‚Äôll have to deal with. 

Lastly, but certainly not least - their actions have led to unsafe living conditions such as people being allowed to enter the dwelling with no notice to the tenants. I came back today to move the rest of my stuff out of the apartment (move out date was 6/20) and expected to be able to chill there to wait out traffic and came back to people working inside the apartment. Additionally, they had moved a bunch of expensive music equipment I had left to pick up and most of it was left damaged. If you look up the reviews on google another person mentioned something‚Äôs seriously concerning regarding a shooting that happened there that the complex gave no notice about and did not address at all. 

There‚Äôs plenty more I could say but I don‚Äôt want to drone on; but I‚Äôm happy to address any questions anyone has. I had a mixed experience for sure and it was home for awhile but I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else to have to be manipulated by this predatory company.

1clkalj,UCSD,Police Raid on Camp,"I walked past the encampment on Saturday while on my way to my lab from grad housing, and it wasn't disruptive at all. [This was basically my reaction to it](https://i.imgur.com/6nBHm8P.png). No one tried to hand me flyers, ask me to sign anything, or ask about my voter registration status, in contrast to what other activists on campus have usually done in the past. Perhaps it was different during the week, but it was quiet and it seemed like people in the camp were just doing their own thing. I've felt unsafe on campus several times, but this was not on one of them. Honestly I felt a little more safe just because there were a bunch of people around (all but one of the times I've felt unsafe on campus was in isolated situations). 
&amp;nbsp;

I thought having three-six police officers monitoring it was excessive; seeing videos and images of police decked out in riot gear clearing out the camp feels downright dystopian just due to how much of an extreme reaction it is. The shutting down of campus also feels ridiculous considering the encampment was localized to one small part of it. I didn't even see the camp in full until Saturday despite being on campus everyday last week. 
&amp;nbsp;

If this requires riot gear, then they should send in a whole battalion every time there's a bunch of clubs or whatever on Library Walk blasting music and shoving flyers in your face.

If you goto overnight cafes like LeStats you can see how much San Diego lacks 24 hour work space with seats and plugs. The public demand is high. Even before the cut it didn‚Äôt have enough space. Now you‚Äôre cutting library hours. This is a very poor decision. There are better ways to cut costs. This isn‚Äôt one.

I‚Äôve been studying at Price center all this time because it is the only place that has the longest hours and always have seatings and air circulation. But Price center is essentially a food court at a mall. That says something about UCSD‚Äôs judgement.",-0.83,Academics

Although I can't really name this person, he is a 5'10 Colombian/Ecuadorian dude from LA county who sa'd my coworker and she never got justice even though she had the evidence AND reported it to OPHD. I have also yet to speak with OPHD about this person and I have also deleted/removed all of my evidence of abuse which makes this case a lot more difficult. And because I know I have limited evidence, I'm posting this here just to warn everyone. A couple others from my HS have also mentioned that they received unwanted sexual remarks and unsolicited phone calls. He would spam their phone and would not stop calling until they picked up. As for his ex-gf, i was told that he recorded her without her knowing during (ykwhat), consistently asked for threesomes, cheated on her multiple times, and RARELY used protection/purchased contraceptives.

1ew3kgn,UCSD,Important reminders for incoming students!,"Hi all! On behalf of the Incoming Triton Committee\*, I would like to take some time to remind students both old and new of UCSD's guiding values. It is my hope that the older students on campus can demonstrate these values for the edification of incoming students.

First and foremost, UCSD is a *quiet university*. What does this mean? Well, for starters, don't talk to the people around you in lecture. UCSD has worked tirelessly in the past to maintain serenity, peace, and my personal solipsism. If in doubt, remember that nobody wants to talk to you, and that everyone is quiet because they think you are weird. Also- don't talk when walking around with friends! Many students at UCSD do not have friends. In the interest of maintaining a safe space for these people, you should refrain from talking. If you absolutely must talk to someone, please visit the designated smoke spot under Geisel; that is where all the other degenerates hang out.

Second: it's not imposter syndrome, you actually are a failure! Everybody knows you are a fraud. Every single person in each of your classes is in every way smarter and more accomplished than you. Additionally, you are the only person experiencing imposter syndrome! So ultimately, in service of values (1) and (2), make sure not to tell anyone when you are suffering from self-doubt.

In fact, this transitions naturally into the third value: please do not tell people that you are mentally unwell, even if you are on the verge of a breakdown. UCSD and CAPS (student psychological services) have poured immense amounts of funding into ensuring that CAPS is completely dysfunctional. Remember: the university doesn't want you to feel better, it just wants you to be silent and graduate! And you wouldn't want to be a burden anyways, right? For an example of virtuous conduct, [please refer](https://www.businessinsider.com/california-doctor-drove-family-off-cliff-tesla-mental-health-diversion-2024-6?amp) to our alum who maintained integrity (i.e. silence) in the face of despair.

Ultimately, it is out hope that you hate your time at UCSD. Please feel free to donate money to us when you actually get that job at Google though!

1h8oug1,UCSD,Gonna miss this place,"Welp. After this finals week I'm done at UCSD.

It's been a long road for me. Autism got me put in special education, and teachers leaving me to my own devices because I was smart and well-behaved so they could deal with the other students meant I ended up not finishing high school on time. Ended up changing special ed schools and finishing high school after another three years.

After that I started at San Diego Mesa College, attending part-time due to disability. It was a shock; while I was in special ed, I didn't get any homework, and suddenly I had to adjust to something at least resembling a college workload. My first semester was English and trigonometry... I remember in that English class we spent some time studying Hamlet, and the professor went on and on about the Oedipal interpretation of Hamlet, and I couldn't fucking stand it. We had to do essays on topics drawn from a hat... Of course I drew the slip about Hamlet and his mother. As for the trigonometry class, I got a 104.7%, which if I recall was the highest possible grade in the class. Still don't know how I pulled that off.

Four years later I was still at Mesa. Not for any good reason, mind you; at Mesa your disability liaison takes the place of an academic advisor, and the one I had fucking lied to me and told me I had to do *EVERY SINGLE TRACK* on the IGETC to transfer. By the time I realized, I had already credited out from being eligible to transfer to CSU, when my no.1 goal school was Cal Poly Pomona. Applied to UC on a partial IGETC on nothing but a prayer, and by some miracle, I got accepted to a bunch of UCs as a math major, but UCSD accepted me for Computer Science, which was the major I wanted to get into, at Muir, which was the college I ranked no.1.

I was still attending part-time, of course. And I had to start the computer science coursework from the beginning. So things took a while. And then COVID hit. God, that fucked things up. I really struggled to get back into the swing of in-person education after lockdown ended. I ended up dropping out entirely two fall quarters in a row, and there were some quarters where instead of two classes I dropped down to only one. Things have been rough, and my GPA, while still high enough, did slip more than I'd like. But, six years later, after just over ten years total in higher education, I'm finally at the finish line.

Just in time for a job market that's been blown to hell, of course. But I'm optimistic. I'm going to spend the next couple months grinding LeetCode and CodeSignal exercises, and then I'm hitting the job market like a bus. Being disabled and transgender, last month's election has me really worried, and, well. Me being a skilled worker is my best shot at avoiding if things get really bad. So I'm going to have to work my ass off. But I'm hopeful.

I just can't believe I finally made it.

Nobody believed in me. My mom wanted to put me in a group home after I finished high school. Blew smoke up my ass about how we'd be 'together forever', only to be telling all her friends and our relatives that she 'couldn't deal with me anymore'. My psychiatrist was basically her peon. And when I had my reading speed tested at that second high school, since my reading speed is slower than most people's due to my vision issues, the person there from the San Diego Unified School District basically without saying the actual word called me a retard. The only one who actually believed in me was my dad. And thank god he did, or I probably would've ended up in that group home, and I probably would've just fucking killed myself, if I'm being honest.

I'm gonna miss this place. Like... Six years. Six years of being a Triton. Six years of going to Price Center. Sunshine Market was practically a member of the family before they closed with how often I'd go in there to get breakfast, or a quick lunch between classes. Six years of Center Hall, of Warren Lecture Hall, of spending late nights in the dungeon working on programming homework until 2, 3, 4 AM. Seeing them open Franklin Antonio Hall, and spending like a fucking hour wandering around the building wondering where the hell my classroom was (the room numbers there make NO SENSE AT ALL)... Six years of going to the EnVision Center after class, to study, to hang out with people, to make things with the 3D printers and the laser cutter... Hell, that's what I spent my COVID stimulus on, a Prusa 3D printer so I could keep making things while it was closed during lockdown. I've since gotten a better printer, and I donated the Prusa to the EnVision Center and they're using it as their flexible filament printer. Always give back to your community. Always.

This is sort of meandering at this point. I just... I dunno. I'm really gonna miss this place. And don't let anyone ever stop you from achieving your dreams. God knows there were times I wanted to give up, throughout this entire process. But here I am. I can only hope the same for you reading this.

Around a week ago, there was a post on this subreddit of someone showing a website regarding UCSD making $6,200 in parking tickets, which was being updated in real time including locations as well.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1fnac12/ucsd\_made\_6200\_from\_tickets\_in\_the\_last\_24hrs](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1fnac12/ucsd_made_6200_from_tickets_in_the_last_24hrs)

The website was [https://ucsdtickets.com](https://ucsdtickets.com), and yeah I was the one who made it.

It was never supposed to be made public, as I was doing this web scraping simply for my own internal data analysis. I received a ton of questions regarding how something like this was made in the first place. Since UCSD patched the vulnerability and I don't see the website being harmful to anyone anymore, I wrote a blogpost about it. Feel free to read if you're interested:

It‚Äôs been like this for the last week or two ever since I sent him a stupid tiktok, and he discovered what it was.

It goes like, ‚Äúhawk 1: wheres hawk 3?, hawk 2: uhhh‚Äù and then he sits there and asks if I get it until I say yes, ITS INFURIATING.

1gmzxv5,UCSD,We made a wesbite to make enrollment easier!,"Hello! The schedule of classes for winter quarter was released a couple days ago :O



We know just how tedious it can be to figure out what classes to take, know what to first pass, and find the perfect schedule, so we created the Triton Student Enrollment Assistant ‚Äì TritonSEA! It's a website by UCSD students, for UCSD students, that will make your life easier and reduce your 20 open tabs for enrollment down to just 1.



Here are some of the cool things it can do

* Import your degree audit and get personalized class recommendations
* View stats and enrollment information for classes in previous quarters
* Make your schedule and 4 year plan
* Search and filter the UCSD catalog



We are currently labeling this a ‚Äúbeta test‚Äù, we will continue to support the website and make updates throughout the year. If you notice any bugs or would like to request new features please join the [discord](https://discord.gg/HS2F3n7QJd), link can also be found at the bottom of the website!



*DISCLAIMER: Using TritonSEA won‚Äôt enroll you into the class itself, only webreg handles actual registration.*



You can find the website here at [**triton-sea.com**](http://triton-sea.com) 

Good luck with enrollment everyone!

1ftgsf2,UCSD,First week: A hot mess,"Alright, so it‚Äôs Day 1 at UCSD, and I‚Äôm already running late. It‚Äôs 8:10am, and my first class is in York Hall at 8. Problem is, I‚Äôm in Sixth College, which means I basically need to hike across the campus version of the Sahara Desert. I grab my skateboard, throw on the same hoodie I‚Äôve worn for one day, and basically literally fly out of the dorm.

As soon as I hit the sidewalk, I‚Äôm met with the Geisel Gauntlet. Why is it that everyone and their mom has decided to walk aimlessly around this one spot? Are people just drawn to the weird spaceship vibe? No one is going inside, but apparently, this is where the sidewalk ends‚Äîbecause nobody‚Äôs letting me through.

After dodging some clueless walkers and almost wiping out trying to avoid a rogue bird scooter, I finally make it to York Hall. Or, well, I thought I did. But UCSD buildings are basically puzzle rooms designed to mess with your head. I‚Äôm wandering the hallways like I‚Äôm in a fever dream until I find Room 6006A‚Äîon the fifth floor. I didn‚Äôt even know this building had five floors.

I stumble in, completely out of breath, and sit next to this dude who already looks like he‚Äôs prepping for med school finals. He‚Äôs got flashcards. He‚Äôs got highlighters. This guy‚Äôs running on pre-med energy while I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how to turn my laptop on without making it look like I‚Äôm struggling. Ugh.

Ten minutes into class, I discover that UCSD WiFi is, as expected, absolute garbage. It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúOh, you need to look something up? That‚Äôs cute, but not happening.‚Äù Lol. I try to hotspot my phone, but Verizon clearly thinks I‚Äôm in some kind of wilderness zone. I‚Äôm fully ready to just start taking notes on napkins at this point. Lol.

After that minor WiFi disaster, it‚Äôs finally time for lunch, and of course, I end up in line at Panda Express. What can I say? I make bad decisions. The line is insane. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs longer than the campus tour line for prospective students, and by the time I get my food, it‚Äôs practically dinner. I sit down, crack open some noodles, and overhear some people talking about 8th College like it‚Äôs Bigfoot or something.

‚ÄúYo, I‚Äôm telling you, I‚Äôve never seen 8th College. It‚Äôs like a myth.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, dude, I think it‚Äôs a prank UCSD plays on incoming freshmen to confuse us.‚Äù

Honestly, I‚Äôm starting to believe them. Has anyone actually been to 8th College? Do they even offer classes? I have questions.

It‚Äôs now 3 PM, and I‚Äôve somehow managed to survive my first class, only to realize that I need to pick up a package from the mailroom. Now, I don‚Äôt know who runs UCSD Mail Services, but I think they secretly enjoy watching students spiral into existential crises. I get to the mailroom, swipe my student ID, and the machine beeps at me like I‚Äôve committed a crime. Turns out my package is ‚Äúpending.‚Äù What does that even mean? Pending what? Judgment from the gods?

Anyway, I leave package-less and head to my next battle: UCSD parking. If you think you can just park on this campus like a normal human being, you‚Äôre wrong. The parking lot is basically Mad Max, and every spot is being patrolled by some mysterious entity who tickets you the moment you blink. After 20 minutes of circling, I park in some random lot that feels like it‚Äôs closer to Mexico than my dorm.

By the time I get back to my room, I‚Äôm like so dead. Complete poop. I flop onto my bed, ready to pass out, but right before I can, I get an email. It seems like it‚Äôs an email reminding me that my tuition bill has dropped. Perfect. Like I needed another reason to be stressed. Guess I‚Äôll be surviving on instant noodles for the rest of the quarter.

But wait. Something feels off. I glance at the email again, and suddenly, I notice‚Ä¶ the class I‚Äôve been running around for, stressing over, isn‚Äôt even on my schedule.

Turns out, I was enrolled at SDSU the whole time.",-0.83,Mental Health

Attempts to Censure Khosla also failed, and vast majority of  faculty supported Khosla's decision to disband the encampment (""Should Chancellor Khosla have authorized the use of an outside police force to remove the encampment?"" question).

Common sense prevails. Majority opposition against Khosla came from Humanities, while vast majority of strong vocal support for Khosla was in STEM, Biological sciences and Medical School.

Only about 40% of eligible faculty voted but there are good reasons to believe that the results would have been even more devastating for ""No Confidence"" group had we had closer to 100% vote participation.

1cjkdrn,UCSD,UCPD / ucsd guards violating library policy and4th amendment,"BREAKING-NEWS: police stops were overshadowed by sungod‚Äôs cancellation, and because they were doing this policy in the middle of the night. There are several reports of students being racially profiled and legally ID stopped for entry to Geisel for late night entry. They are disguising it as the normal ‚Äúshow‚Äù ID policy for entry where you flash your ID when it is closed to the public but according to students, it sounds like what is occurring is a LEGAL ID STOP which they are not disclosing upon requesting ID.  Therefore this MAY be illegal search and seizure as they are coercing this so called ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù handover of ID which they are TAKING PHOTOS OF without telling students in advance. There is no information on who or what this database of photos is being used for. The reports have been 4/5 POC targeted as of now.

California is NOT a ‚Äústop and identify‚Äù state. First, you have the right to be INFORMED that you are being legally stopped by an officer, or to request justification for the stop. 

Second, you have the right to DECLINE to self ID. 

Remember UCSD policy does NOT detail this, as policy. Merely that you ‚Äúshow‚Äù ID for entry. this practice is likely NOT sanctioned by the library and they have not released any public policy changes as of now. 
KNOW YOUR RIGHTS! IF YOU SEE THIS HAPPENING ASK IF IT IS A LEGAL STOP.

THEN: Am I being detained?
No (likely, they cannot detain without reasonable cause a crime is being committed)
If it is YES retain the right to remain silent. Contact an attorney.
If NO: ‚ÄúAm I free to leave?‚Äù 
You may leave OR remain in the area though they may deny you access to Giesel for declining.

If you see this policy being implemented in a BIASED manner please REPORT IT IMMEDIATELY. Regardless of your position on protesting, students do NOT shed their constitutional rights and protections in a protest environment. Racial profiling has no place at higher institution! 

The policy is supposed to be race-blind and applied 10pm-7am according to sources.

You can: ‚ÄúSend an email to LibraryBorrowing@ucsd.edu so that they can redirect the complaints to admin‚Äù 

I will put sources to report and file complaints below. PLEASE CONTACT THE LIBRARY TO CONDEMN ID STOPS AND RACIAL PROFILING. ‚ÄºÔ∏è

1esbqn6,UCSD,Dear rightfully panicked UCSD incoming students,"I'm sure that the University will not cancel the admissions of thousands of students, as by the sheer volume of duplicate posts on this subreddit I'm sure admissions is aware of the problem. The one thing I can say with certainty is that this is NOT unprecedented, and I remember something similar happening to incoming students last year.   
Unfortunately, by other posts I have read, some people have attempted to resolve the issue by calling the admissions office 20 times or more in a row.   
  
THIS WILL NOT HELP. There are likely hundreds if not THOUSANDS of people calling a few panicked student workers at the admissions office reception. They are surely aware of the problem if there are hundreds of calls coming in every day leading up to new student enrollment.  
  
If you can't get ahold of people, they are likely aware of the issue as you are most certainly not the only person with this problem. The only thing you can do now is to fill out the form, email and call *at most* semi-frequently, as there is likely an enormous backlog of emails and unanswered calls, and let the situation work itself out.

My one suggestion would be to try to reach out to any VAC (major dept/college advising) you can get ahold of. Make Enrollment Authorization System (EASy) requests to satisfy prerequisites you need to enroll in your classes. Reach out to the college level help, and I'm sure they will connect you with someone that can help if you let them know you have not been able to get a response from admissions via email/phone/etc.

1hdqcij,UCSD,The problem with the Che Cafe and how to fix it.,"For the past year, I volunteered at the Che Caf√©, one of UCSD‚Äôs oldest and most iconic institutions. It‚Äôs a historic building, originally used as barracks during World War II, and now serves as a community space for concerts, events, and student gatherings.

The Che is a unique and valuable resource on campus. It offers affordable food, regular events, and a space where students and community members can connect and feel part of something bigger. However, I also understand why some students might feel intimidated or alienated when they step into the Che.

I spent a year cooking, cleaning, and volunteering there, becoming a key member of the community. Despite this, I eventually realized that feelings of exclusion weren‚Äôt just in my head. They were rooted in structural issues within the collective that runs the Che.

# My Observations and Experience

I want to be upfront: these observations are my own, and they may be influenced by my personal experiences. After sharing my concerns with the collective, I became the target of what felt like a character assassination. Some members responded defensively to my critiques, and that experience left me hurt and frustrated. While I believe my points have merit, I also acknowledge I could be biased because of how things unfolded.

Here are the issues I noticed:

* **Non-Hierarchical in Name Only**: The Che prides itself on being a ""non-hierarchical"" space, but in practice, this isn‚Äôt entirely true. Many of the core volunteers are close friends, often White, visibly queer, and from relatively privileged backgrounds. They naturally gravitate toward people like themselves, which creates an invisible hierarchy.
* **Cliquey Dynamics**: For students of color or those who don‚Äôt fit this demographic, the Che can feel cliquey and unwelcoming. Even as someone who was deeply involved, I noticed that ideas or contributions from people outside the core group were often met with hesitation or resistance.
* **Implicit Biases**: No one at the Che is explicitly racist or exclusionary. The volunteers are educated, socially conscious people who understand that racism is wrong. However, implicit biases can still play a role. The core group often feels more comfortable with people like themselves, and this dynamic can alienate others.
* **Meetings as Gatekeeping**: General meetings at the Che often feel overly technical and boring, which I believe is one way the current group maintains control. These meetings are important‚Äîthey decide how funds from concerts and events are spent‚Äîand every student who attends has a voice, according to the [Che‚Äôs bylaws](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GI--3nlxYiukrAL8h68SI2Y-GWSmUlFG?usp=drive_link). But the tone and structure of the meetings can discourage wider participation.

# Why This Matters

The Che Caf√© *should* be a place where everyone feels welcome. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to know that many non-White students who once felt comfortable there left after I did, as they told me I was the only person they could talk to.

That said, I don‚Äôt want anyone to write off the Che. It remains one of the best resources on campus:

* **Affordable Food**: The Che offers meals during study hours and regular Monday meal-and-discussion events.
* **A Place to Connect**: It‚Äôs a space to meet new people and find community.
* **A Voice for Students**: General meetings give students the opportunity to directly influence decisions about the space and campus as a whole.

If you feel unsure about visiting or getting involved, I encourage you to give it a chance. If you feel out of place, know that your feelings aren‚Äôt unfounded‚Äîbut also know you have the ability to help make the Che more inclusive and welcoming.

# Why I Left

My own experience at the Che has been complicated. I left the collective after sharing concerns about its structure and dynamics, as my suggestions often made others defensive. Even small recommendations‚Äîlike cleaning the windows‚Äîseemed to spark resistance.

I want to be clear: I‚Äôm not attacking anyone personally. All the people I met at the Che are intelligent and kind. The issue lies in institutional and structural dynamics, not in any one individual.

I believe new volunteers‚Äîstudents like you‚Äîcan help make the Che a better place. With your voice and involvement, it can become a space that truly welcomes everyone.

‚Ä¢ in 2016 many liberal or democratic voters sat out, this not only made an issue for the electoral college win for that one guy, Roe v Wade got overturned. 
‚Ä¢ in 2020 those same citizens (and then some) realized the mess we were getting into and voted to help change course. 
‚Ä¢ We are set up in a very poor voting system (2-party popular or plurality vote, winner takes all) with an imbalanced electoral college that allows for unfair district lines and gerrymandering. This doesn't mean your vote doesn't count, it's really that it counts even more so because of this flawed system. 
‚Ä¢ We can change that by learning about and advocating for Ranked Choice Voting which is gaining huge momentum in our country. 
‚Ä¢ Voting locally matters just as much because not only are these people supposed to represent our communities, they may be working their way up the political ladder. 
‚Ä¢ Lastly, if you think politicians don't care about us...that's mainly because of our current voting system, not allowing for people like us to represent us.

1hch3a1,UCSD,Does Santa come to ucsd,"I‚Äôm in Pepper Canyon West but these people built our building without a chimney how is Santa going to get in. I was a good boy this year :(. I was going to leave out milk and cookies too, but he has no way to get into my dorm to put presents under the tree. I was wondering what people do for Santa to come to campus.",-0.55,Social

1clvdzj,UCSD,Removal of UCSD Chancellor when?,"For context, I am a 4th year graduate student at UCSD and steward in student worker union UAW 4811. I've been to the encampment to give them apples, oranges, and sunscreen. The encampment was entirely peaceful &amp; minimally disruptive with respect to regular campus operations. I and many of my colleagues had no issue with the encampment,  and I commend everyone who risked their safety and career to stand up for victims in this conflict.

 I thought the encampment was ENTIRELY REASONABLE as a method of students and other members of the UCSD community to express our desire to not have our tuition or money from our work as student workers invested into companies which profit from the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. OUR money is being used in UC's investment portfolio to this end, we have the right to request a change of policy such that we are less complicit in this genocide. 

There is historical precedent for this: protests NEARLY IDENTICAL to these were performed in order to pressure for divestment from apartheid South Africa decades ago at campuses across the nation, and many other peaceful protests throughout history have made massive impacts to change the policies that enable this type of violence and oppression. From the vast majority of sources that I've seen, the contemporary protest movement has done an amazing job regarding nonviolent practices of political speech. From the apparent evidence, the modern protest movement has been even more cognizant of nonviolence than in the past. The basic demands are very reasonable: stop spending the money you get from our tuition and labors supporting a genocide. Any college administration, police force, government body, media, etc should recognize the historical parallels and do their due diligence with respect to upholding civil rights and negotiating in good faith over the requested policy reforms. It is not an excuse to feign ignorance if you're tasked with an important administrator job and paid upwards of a million dollars a year to run the campus. 

Many campuses have dealt with these issues responsibly by agreeing to hold student body votes on divestment and taking actions such as this. Today we see that UCSD administration has chose a different path: APPLYING STATE VIOLENCE TO SUPPRESS PROTEST.

This is BLATANTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL use of agents of the state, police, to suppress free speech and assembly. The UCSD admin will have many excuses, namely that the encampment wasn't sanctioned by them and are mildly outside of the modus operandi of the university, looking out for 'safety' (?? cops assaulting people), and other institutional excuses such as this; however, these reasonings are extremely weak given the peaceful nature of the protests and the reasonable demands of the protestors. Hence the reasonings they give are NO EXCUSE for an authoritarian, unconstitutional, violent crackdown of free speech and free expression. 

This leaves us with a simple conclusion: the chancellor and campus leadership are UNFIT to do the basic job of upholding civil rights on our campus, and they shouldn't be able to wield the power to summon a mob of police officers to assault and arrest peacefully protesting students. Civil rights should be upheld NO MATTER WHAT and the Chancellor has shown the inability to respect such. It should be a career-ending embarrassment to be paid over a million dollars a year to run a university yet you can't understand the first line of the bill of rights in our nation. Shame

So the main call to action that I have: UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla should RESIGN from his position, and if he refuses to then the student body should immediately begin the process of having a VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE or some other procedure to remove him from his position. 

I appreciate any comments or discussions to flesh out how the student body can begin the procedure to at least vote on this matter. You may disagree and vote against his removal, that's fine; what I'm interested in is the procedure about how this should go down &amp; historical precedent. to at least have a student body vote on the matter.",-0.83,Politics
